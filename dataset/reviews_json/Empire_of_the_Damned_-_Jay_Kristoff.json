            "Gabriel's character development is profoundly engaging, particularly in his increasingly fatherly relationship with Dior. While Dior's sections occasionally fall into typical YA tropes, she truly comes alive in her interactions with Gabriel. Phoebe, the skinchanger, stands out with her fierce personality, captivating backstory, and an unexpected romantic subplot. Celene adds intrigue and mystery, sharply contrasting with Gabriel's emotional openness. The villains, especially the Blood Dyvok, are barbaric yet intelligent, though they don't quite match the menace of the Blood Voss from the first book.",
            "The author's writing style is immersive, skillfully blending humor and tragedy within a tense atmosphere that exudes a sense of impending doom. The worldbuilding is rich and inventive, introducing captivating elements such as a vampire house, skinchangers, and the Esani faction. Additionally, the exquisite illustrations enhance the reading experience, vividly bringing the story to life."
        ],
        "conclusion": "I’m thoroughly enjoying this story, and the latest installment is a strong sequel, though not quite as epic as the first book. It’s a dark, addictive read with rich worldbuilding, complex characters, and a gripping narrative. The cliffhanger ending left me eager for the next installment. This is not a standalone book, so I highly recommend reading both books back-to-back. It would also make an incredible TV series!",

            "*Empire of the Damned*, the second installment in the author's grimdark vampire apocalypse series, shifts its focus from the mix of magic school and survival found in the first book to a more traditional fantasy narrative centered on an impending battle between ancient vampires and humanity. Though it exhibits some \"middle book\" syndrome, occasionally feeling aimless, it remains consistently engaging. The sprawling epic takes its time to immerse readers in its richly crafted world, drawing inspiration from classic fantasy yet maintaining a brisk pace. This installment reveals significant secrets from the first book, addressing lingering mysteries as the vampire apocalypse approaches. The gradual unveiling of worldbuilding and plot details stands out as a strength, with minimal reliance on info dumping.",
            "The first book focused solely on Gabriel's perspective, but this sequel introduces Celene, Gabriel's long-lost sister, as a new point of view. Celene, an Esani vampire with unique abilities, including a form of omnipresence, provides essential context about other characters, particularly Dior. In this installment, Dior takes center stage, with her adventures and struggles examined through Celene’s neutral lens. This perspective enriches our understanding of the vampire hierarchy, adding depth to the characters while highlighting their villainy. Gabriel's flaws become more pronounced as he loses control of his circumstances, making him a more complex and sometimes frustrating character. In contrast, female characters like Dior and Celene shine, with Gabriel taking a backseat. Jean-François remains a standout, delivering some of the best scenes. The relationships, especially between Celene and Gabriel, are further explored, although external conflicts dominate the narrative. This installment also confirms that nearly every character is bisexual or gay, providing strong queer representation. Fans of LGBTQ+ themes will be pleased, while those who prefer less representation may find it disappointing.",
            "The author's engaging writing style breathes life into even the most uneventful scenes. His approachable prose transforms what could have been a dry plot into a vibrant, captivating read. Despite its 700-page length, the book moves swiftly and remains surprisingly entertaining, even for those with shorter attention spans.",
            "This book explores the dark realm of the vampire threat, particularly its effects on enslaved Thralls. While it retains the engaging character interactions that fans adore, it adheres to a more traditional story structure that builds toward a dramatic conclusion.",
            "This was my most anticipated sequel, and I'm truly grateful to the publisher for providing me with a physical ARC. I never expected to receive something so exciting!"

        "conclusion": "*Empire of the Damned* is a rewarding sequel that deepens the world and characters of this grimdark epic.

I never thought I’d be important enough to receive something so cool.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - *Empire of the Damned* is the second installment in Jay Kristoff’s grimdark vampire apocalypse series. While the first book was a mix of magic school and apocalyptic survival, this one leans more into traditional fantasy, focusing on the impending battle between ancient vampires and everyone else.  \n  - It does have some “middle book” syndrome, feeling a bit aimless at times, but it’s never boring. The series is a sprawling epic that takes its time to immerse you in its world, borrowing qualities from classics like *Wheel of Time* but moving at a faster pace.  \n  - The book reveals many secrets from the first installment, wrapping up lingering mysteries as the vampire apocalypse looms. The slow drip of worldbuilding and mystery reveals is a strength, with minimal info dumping.  \n\n- **Character Development and POVs:**  \n  - The first book was limited to Gabriel’s perspective, but this one introduces Celene, Gabriel’s long-lost sister, as a new POV. Celene is an Esani vampire with unique abilities, including a form of omnipresence, which provides missing context about other characters, especially Dior.  \n  - Dior takes center stage in this book, with her adventures and struggles explored through Celene’s neutral lens. This POV also deepens our understanding of the vampire hierarchy, adding character depth while reinforcing their villainy.  \n  - Gabriel’s flaws become more apparent as he loses control over his situation, making him a more complex and sometimes frustrating character.

It maintains the juicy character interactions fans love but follows a more traditional story structure, setting up a grand conclusion.  \n  - This installment confirms that nearly every character is bisexual or gay, offering strong queer representation. Fans of queer rep will be delighted, while those who dislike it may be disappointed.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - Kristoff’s writing style makes even scenes where nothing happens feel engaging. His hyper-approachable and readable prose turns what could have been a dry plot into something vibrant and devourable.  \n  - Despite its 700-page length, the book moves quickly and is surprisingly entertaining, even for readers with short attention spans.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* is a rewarding sequel that deepens the world and characters of Jay Kristoff’s grimdark epic. It balances character development, mystery reveals, and worldbuilding while setting the stage for an epic conclusion. Fans of the series and Kristoff’s writing will find much to love, especially with its strong queer representation and engaging storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel chronicles Gabriel de Leon's heroic yet tragic life as a prisoner of the vampire Empress Margot. The narrative primarily unfolds through a compelling flashback, which I found both engaging and skillfully crafted. It is filled with high-intensity moments, including memorable confrontations and unexpected twists, often leaving Gabriel at a disadvantage. While some scenes verge on the melodramatic, they enhance the book's addictive and entertaining quality. The pacing strikes an effective balance between gripping action sequences and quieter moments of introspection. Although some battles lack clear consequences, and the finality of character deaths can be ambiguous, these minor issues do not detract from the overall thrill of the story.",
            "Gabriel continues to be a captivating protagonist, fueled by his vendetta against formidable vampires like Fabien Voss. The banter between Gabriel and historian Jean-François stands out, showcasing their clever, multilayered exchanges. New characters, including Gabriel's former apprentice and members of Dun Maergenn's court, enhance the story's depth and excitement. Additionally, the introduction of new vampire houses, such as the Blood Dyvok, along with revelations about factions like the Esani, significantly enriches the worldbuilding.",
            "The writing is immersive, skillfully intertwining dark fantasy with humor and tragedy. The unexpected shifts in narrative perspective enrich the reading experience, making it highly satisfying. With a consistent tone that embodies the grimdark genre, the story culminates in a deeply resonant and tragic finale.",
            "The novel enriches its well-crafted fantasy world by delving into the complexities of vampire politics, history, and power dynamics. Nearly 40% of the narrative unfolds in the imposing city of Dun Maergenn, providing a captivating backdrop. Additionally, the exploration of skinchangers and the sacred vampiric faction known as the Esani adds intriguing layers to the story."

However, I was thrown off when the narrative shifted away from Gabriel’s perspective at a certain point.  \n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book had me hooked from the first page to the last. The pacing was excellent, and I was fully immersed in the story.  \n- **Anticipation for the Series:**  \n  I’m incredibly excited to see how Jay Kristoff will conclude the series and can’t wait for the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book, especially the improved narrative structure and its gripping pace. While the shift in perspective was a bit jarring, it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 🌟"

This new character's perspective enriches the story, broadening its scope and adding depth to the world-building and lore. The dual viewpoints enhance the narrative's complexity and counterbalance Gabriel’s biased narration. Although the overarching plot advances slowly, the story is filled with tension from action scenes, inner struggles, interpersonal drama, and character development. The pacing remains engaging throughout, notably avoiding the typical middle book syndrome.",

The supporting cast is equally dynamic, eliciting a wide range of emotions—from love to hate—while their fates leave a lasting impact.",

It’s lengthy, but it’s clearly a good ride, and I can’t wait for the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a fantastic, intense, and dark experience. The plot was unpredictable, the characters were well-developed, and the illustrations were stunning. Despite its length, it was a captivating read, and I’m eagerly looking forward to the next book in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He kept the lingo true to the time, and the accents of different cultures were played out well. The heartbreaks and hopes were delivered in such a way that only a master storyteller could tell.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My favorite character was Phoebe! Although, Gabriel really wrapped around my heart. I would catch myself laughing out loud at his wit.\n\n- **Narration (Audio Book):**  \n  With this being such a big chonker of a book, I decided to grab the audio to read along with. I utterly melted to Damian Lynch's voice. His deep voice, his acting, and the clear, precise way he speaks were beyond bliss. On a 5-star rating, I would give him a 7.  \n  However, Shakira Shute narrated Celene's POV and nearly ruined this book. I could not understand her, and her acting was shite. I cringed at her horrible attempt at Lilidh. She would change a word here and there, I'm sure because it made better sense to her, but it changed the lingo that Kristoff was giving us. To save the story, I read Celene's \"book\" without audio.\n\n- **Plot and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The sex scenes were done with class and taste. The heartbreaks and hopes were delivered in such a way that only a master storyteller could tell. I loved the first book, but this one was even better! The chef's kiss!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a bloody fucking masterpiece. Kristoff's storytelling, character development, and atmospheric writing shine brilliantly.

This book is neither better nor worse than the first; it maintains the essence of the story with its dark atmosphere, acid humor, and phenomenal characterization, while introducing some changes to keep it fresh. The reading experience felt \"as good as the last.\"\n\n- **Opening and Exposition:**  \n  The book starts with a strong scene that sets the tone immediately. It also includes a recap of the previous book, which was helpful since it had been a while since I read the first installment. The exposition never felt like an info dump; instead, discoveries were made alongside the characters at the right moments.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  My favorite part of the book, as with the first, was the character dynamics, especially between Gabriel and Dior. Kristoff excels at writing characters and forging bonds between them, whether familial or otherwise. The new characters were wonderful, each having their moment to shine without overshadowing the beloved returning characters.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The pacing was somewhat inconsistent, with moments where not much happened plot-wise. However, Kristoff used these slower sections to deepen character development, so I never felt bored. The climax was mind-blowing, packed with action and emotional moments that left a lasting impact.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Anticipation for the Next Book:**  \n  The ending was audacious and emotionally devastating. Days later, I’m still reeling from those final pages. I don’t know how I’ll survive the wait for the next book. If it’s as good as its predecessors, this trilogy could become one of my all-time favorites.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my high expectations, maintaining the dark atmosphere, humor, and character depth of the first installment while introducing fresh elements. Despite some pacing inconsistencies, the character development and explosive climax made it a compelling read.

            "After the first book's exploration of multiple timelines, I was eager to see how the author would further develop Gabriel de León's story. The narrative choice in this installment is both clever and effective, as it presents the plot from various perspectives, enriching the depth and complexity of the narrative.",
            "Gabriel de León is a captivating protagonist, portrayed as a tormented yet larger-than-life figure haunted by his past. His courage, sarcasm, and relentless determination set him apart. Notably, his unconventional, anti-hypocritical nature and slim but enduring hope as a disruptor of conventions make him a truly admirable character.",

At over 720 pages, it feels like two books in one—dense and brimming with events and characters to absorb. Although it took me longer to finish than usual, this was not due to difficulty but rather the sheer volume and richness of the story.",

The Emperor has retreated to a final stronghold in the east. The world is richly immersive, vast, and hauntingly detailed.",

The narrative choice here is clever and effective, as we experience the story from multiple perspectives, adding depth and complexity to the plot.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel de León remains a deeply compelling protagonist. He’s a tormented, larger-than-life figure burdened by his past, yet he’s courageous, sarcastic, and unwaveringly determined. His unconventional, anti-hypocritical nature makes him a standout character. His slim but enduring hope and his role as a disruptor of conventions are particularly admirable.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel maintains a dark, grim tone with splatter and bloody moments. The atmosphere is consistently oppressive, reflecting the dire state of the world and the characters’ struggles.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I adored the book and am already dreading the year-long wait for the next installment. Gabriel’s journey, his struggles, and his unyielding spirit left a lasting impression.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterful continuation of Gabriel de León’s story, offering a rich, immersive world, complex characters, and a gripping narrative. Its length and depth make it a rewarding read, though it demands time and attention. The dark tone and emotional weight of the story linger long after the final page.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story resumes after the brutal massacre of the Silversaints aimed at sacrificing Gabriel de Leon’s protégé, Dior Lachance. Gabriel and Dior embark on their journey alongside Gabriel’s sister, Celene, who has mysteriously transformed into a vampire. The narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat, maintaining the fast pace and intensity of its predecessor while delving deeper into the lore of the already rich world. The intricate plot unfolds through dual perspectives, seamlessly switching between them and enriching the storytelling experience. If you enjoyed the previous installment, this one won’t disappoint.",

Gabriel's determination to rescue her propels the narrative, but their journey is riddled with enemies intent on his destruction.",

The story picks up after the slaughter of the Silversaints who wanted to sacrifice Gabriel de Leon’s protégé, Dior Lachance. Gabriel and Dior continue their journey, teaming up with Gabriel’s sister, Celene, who has been turned into a vampire of mysterious origin.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed the pace of the previous book, this one won’t disappoint. It maintains the same level of violence and expands the lore, adding another layer to the already rich world.  \n  - The plot is intricate and engaging, with the same storyline told from two perspectives. The switch between perspectives feels natural and enhances the storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters remain deeply haunted, and the book delves further into their struggles. Gabriel and Dior face relentless challenges, and Dior’s capture by the Dyvok clan exposes her to the cruel and dark nature of the vampires.  \n  - Gabriel’s determination to save Dior drives the narrative, but their path is fraught with enemies who seek his demise.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  - The book expands on the world’s lore, providing deeper insights into the Daysdeath and the vampire clans. The storytelling feels immersive, and the additional layers of lore enhance the overall experience.  \n\n- **Art and Visuals:**  \n  - The book features stunning artwork that complements the story. Each illustration offers a glimpse into the narrative on the accompanying pages, adding a visual dimension that I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  - I felt slightly annoyed by Gabriel and Celene’s continued capture by the dimwitted historian. While I understand the scene’s purpose, I kept hoping for an epic escape, given their mutual hatred and resourcefulness. Perhaps this will be addressed in the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI loved this book just as much as the first one. It’s filled with death, darkness, and gory details, which I thoroughly enjoy, but it also includes lighter moments that balance the story well.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Context:**  \n  In a year filled with excellent reads like *The Blacktongue Thief*, *Blood Song*, *The Tainted Cup*, and *City of Miracles*, *Empire of the Damned* doesn’t necessarily stand out but still earns its place among the books I feel fortunate to have discovered. I had a lot of fun with this book, which never overstayed its welcome despite its length. I’m eagerly anticipating the third entry in the series.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is undeniably \"grimdark,\" and while this may not appeal to everyone, it sets clear expectations for the tone and content. I personally enjoyed the first book despite its flaws, such as the \"fridging\" trope and some overly obvious narrative inspirations. However, this review focuses on *Empire of the Damned*, not the first book or the unfinished trilogy.\n\n- **Middle Book Execution:**  \n  Kristoff successfully navigates the challenges of a middle book by continuing to build on the world, concepts, and characters introduced in the first installment. He sets up numerous intriguing plot threads that promise to pay off in the next book, all while ensuring this entry remains exciting and excellent in its own right.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Gabe and Dior’s relationship is further explored, and while there aren’t many surprises here, I still loved their dynamic. Phoebe’s return and her relationship with Gabe were highlights for me, as was Celene’s turn as a narrator, which added a fresh and enjoyable perspective.\n\n- **Action and Villains:**  \n  The action scenes are as thrilling as ever, and Kristoff excels at crafting compelling villains. In this book, the antagonists receive more page time, making them even more engaging and menacing.\n\n- **Audience Appeal:**  \n  If you enjoyed the first book, you’ll undoubtedly like this one. Conversely, if the first book didn’t resonate with you, this sequel is unlikely to change your opinion or pique your interest.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* is a strong middle entry in the series, successfully expanding on the world, characters, and stakes while delivering an exciting and self-contained story. It builds anticipation for the next installment and solidifies its place as a worthy addition to the grimdark genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Gabriel de León remains imprisoned in Empress Margot’s château, where Jean-François, her chronicler and historian, diligently documents the history of the last Silversaint and the Grail. The conclusion of the first book left their relationship in a pivotal state, forcing Gabriel to resume his account with Jean-François in the tower. However, this time their meeting is shorter, as Jean-François must share his attention with another guest at the château. The narrative becomes increasingly intriguing and brutal. At one point, the Grail slips from Gabriel's watchful gaze—though he is not alone. The bond between him and Dior, the Grail, evolves beautifully, creating a captivating dynamic. I won’t reveal specifics, as it's enthralling to witness their relationship unfold while uncertain of its ultimate direction. The ending is brilliantly crafted, leaving readers craving the next installment and opening numerous possibilities for the future. It’s exceptionally well-done.",
            "The second part upholds the exceptional standard established by the first volume. The characters are expertly crafted, and their development is outstanding. The relationship between Gabriel and Dior is especially compelling, evolving in an organic and deeply satisfying manner.",
            "This is a true masterpiece of the genre. I absolutely love it. The story is nothing short of genius.",
            "I eagerly anticipated the second volume of *The Empire of the Vampire*, viewing it as a form of salvation after the brilliance of the first part. It was a true masterpiece—rich with honey, nuts, caramel, chocolate, and cookies. With such high expectations, I feared the dreaded second book syndrome, yet the author once again exceeded my hopes. I’m compelled to explore more of his work; he is truly exceptional."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**  \n  I waited for the second volume of \"The Empire of the Vampire\" like it was salvation. The first part was a masterpiece—honey, nuts, caramel, chocolate, cookies, everything. I had enormous expectations for the continuation and was terrified of the infamous \"second book syndrome.\" But Jay Kristoff seems incapable of disappointing me. I need to delve deeper into his work because the guy is incredible.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Gabriel de León remains confined in Empress Margot’s château, where her chronicler and historian, Jean-François, meticulously records the history of the last Silversaint and the Grail. The ending of the first book left us at a critical moment in the relationship between the two men. Gabriel has no choice but to continue his account, so he and the vampire meet again in the tower to resume their conversation. This time, however, it’s shorter, as Jean-François has another guest in the château and must divide his time between the two. The story becomes even more intriguing and brutal. The Silversaint reaches a point where the Grail briefly slips from his watchful gaze, though he is not alone. The relationship between him and Dior—the Grail—reaches a whole new level and is absolutely perfect. I won’t spoil the details, as it’s fascinating to observe how it gradually unfolds without knowing the ultimate outcome of their connection.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The second part of the series maintains the phenomenally high standard set by the first volume. The characters are brilliantly crafted, and their development is superb. The relationship between Gabriel and Dior is particularly compelling and evolves in a way that feels organic and deeply satisfying.\n\n- **Ending and Future Potential:**  \n  The ending is masterfully thought out and leaves you desperate for the next installment. It opens so many doors for the future that it’s impossible not to be excited. It’s super, super, super well-crafted.\n\n- **Technical Issues:**  \n  The Polish edition has some flaws. There are more typos and errors than one would expect, and some logical mistakes were evidently missed during editing. However, these are technical criticisms and don’t detract from the story itself.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  For me, this is a masterpiece of the genre. I love, love, love it. The story is GENIUS.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe second volume of \"The Empire of the Vampire\" lives up to the high expectations set by the first book. The plot is engaging, the characters are well-developed, and the ending is brilliantly executed, leaving readers eager for more. Despite some technical issues in the Polish edition, the story itself is exceptional and a true gem of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a very high rating, likely 5/5 or equivalent."

            "This book serves as a worthy continuation of the first installment, though it does exhibit some signs of “second-book syndrome,” with certain plot elements feeling elongated in preparation for a grand finale. Nevertheless, it remains an engaging and satisfying read. The intense cliffhanger ending leaves me eagerly anticipating the third book.",
            "Gabriel is one of the most well-crafted characters I've encountered. His relatable trauma and authentic struggles resonate deeply. The author skillfully deepens character arcs, highlighting their human flaws and evolving relationships. Dior also stands out, making the story feel like hers in many ways. However, Celene's character lacks depth and connection, which was disappointing. The new characters introduced in this installment are excellent and enrich the overall narrative. My only letdown is the weaker antagonist compared to the first book.",
            "The author's writing style masterfully balances lightness and darkness, echoing the work of Joe Abercrombie. His dark humor, intense atmosphere, and emotionally charged storytelling captivate readers from start to finish. The pacing is superb, with relentless action that sustains tension throughout. Despite its dense atmosphere—so thick it feels as if it could be \"cut with a knife\"—the book remains accessible. Additionally, the playful and innovative narrative form enhances the overall enjoyment.",
            "The book's atmosphere is one of its standout features. The author skillfully crafts a dark, claustrophobic world where the absence of sunlight and the prevalence of vampires instill a persistent sense of dread and tension. Even during moments of respite, the oppressive ambiance remains, enhancing the story's depth and intensity. The world-building is further enriched by the introduction of new elements such as the Fey, the evolution of Essani, and the exploration of diverse cultures within the Empire.",

It resonated with me personally, distinguishing it from others like *Czarny Język*, *Wspomnienie lodu*, and *Bohaterowie*. The deep emotional connection I formed with the characters and the story is what I cherish most about it."

It resonated with me on a personal level, making it stand out among others like *Czarny Język*, *Wspomnienie lodu*, and *Bohaterowie*. The emotional connection I felt with the characters and the story is what I love most about this series.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel is one of the most well-crafted characters I’ve encountered.

The new characters introduced in this installment are excellent and enhance the overall narrative. My only disappointment is the weaker antagonist compared to the first book.\n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building:**  \n  The atmosphere is one of the strongest aspects of the book.

The book is easy to read despite its dense atmosphere, which feels so thick it could be “cut with a knife.” The narrative form is playful and innovative, adding to the enjoyment.\n\n- **Illustrations and Visual Elements:**  \n  The illustrations accompanying the story are a standout feature. They represent drawings made by the Historian during Gabriel’s recounting and add an extra layer of immersion to the reading experience, helping readers visualize the world more vividly.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the book is a worthy continuation of the first installment, it does suffer slightly from “second-book syndrome,” with some plot elements feeling stretched to set up a grand finale.

The interview aspect of the retelling adds an extra dimension that makes the story even more entertaining.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel, the main character and narrator, is just as fantastic as in the first book. He’s witty, brutal, and flawed, yet has a tender, bleeding heart, which makes him an intriguing character in his fight against vampires and his mission to protect the Holy Grail. I love how his relationship with Dior continues to develop, providing much-needed levity between fight scenes and dark moments. The addition of a second narrator helps fill in gaps where Gabriel’s perspective is limited, offering more insight into vampire lifestyles and hierarchies. Phoebe, a new character, adds complexity and helps Gabriel see things differently, making her a wonderful addition to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Tone:**  \n  This sequel has several heartbreaking scenes, so it’s best to prepare your mind and heart. While it’s sadder and darker at times than the first book, it’s also thrilling and raises the stakes of Gabriel’s journey. The last 100 pages are masterful, packed with action, emotion, and chaos.  \n\n- **Revelations and Continuity:**  \n  Some secrets from the first book are revealed in this sequel, which I appreciated, as it’s hard to keep guessing across three books. The story remains compelling and hard to put down, making this series one of my favorites.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Final Book:**  \n  I’m confident the third and final book will perfectly wrap up this story, and I can’t wait to fangirl over these characters again once it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel is a fantastic continuation of Jay Kristoff’s dark fantasy series, maintaining the same compelling storytelling, rich character development, and emotional depth as the first book.

The narrative is tightly woven, skillfully balancing multiple plot threads and lore while introducing intriguing new elements, such as shape-shifters.

Dior Lachance's character is further developed as she faces challenges and discovers her own strength.

Additionally, Jean-Francois, the vampire historian, brings levity to the narrative with his wit.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  Jay Kristoff maintains a breakneck pace throughout the 700+ pages of *Empire of the Damned*, avoiding the dreaded \"second book slump.\" The narrative is tightly paced and streamlined, balancing multiple plot threads and lore while introducing new elements like shape-shifters. The linear narrative and propulsive action keep the story engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel de Leon remains central, with deeper layers of his pain and bravado revealed. Dior Lachance’s character is fleshed out as she undergoes trials and comes into her own. The addition of Celene’s first-person POV provides a faith-driven perspective and a refreshing contrast to Gabriel’s voice. Jean-Francois, the vampire historian, adds levity with his wit.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The Dyvok vampire court is a highlight, showcasing macabre intrigue and interpersonal dynamics among the vampire houses. The antagonists, such as Count Nikita Dyvok and his sister Lilidth, are richly developed with distinct personalities and agendas, adding depth to the vampiric invasion.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is unapologetically dark and gory, with vivid, sensory descriptions that immerse the reader. Kristoff’s descriptive zeal and unabashed embrace of horror-movie-level violence make the story both riveting and fun, though it could feel over-the-top for some.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The separation of Gabriel and Dior and Gabriel’s plunge into the Dyvok court introduce new stakes and tension. The poisoned twist at the end leaves readers on a cliffhanger, eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n- **Additional Features:**  \n  The inclusion of a character list, three maps, and exquisite illustrations enhances the reading experience, adding depth to the already engrossing world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* is a masterful follow-up that avoids the pitfalls of a second book in a trilogy. With its tight pacing, rich character development, immersive world-building, and unrelenting dark tone, it delivers a gripping and satisfying read. Kristoff’s enthusiasm for his story shines through, making this a standout entry in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I adored the first book in the series and its sequel equally. This is one of the few series I eagerly anticipate, and I make it a priority to read each new release as soon as it comes out.\n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  Kristoff’s portrayal of monstrous and tormented vampires is a standout feature, with clear nods to Anne Rice’s vampire saga. The prose is pretentious yet stunning, and I find it utterly captivating. I could read about these characters and immerse myself in his writing style for an entire year without needing anything else. The illustrations are a delightful addition, bringing the beloved characters to life. I often found myself staring at them for minutes before turning the page.\n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  While I acknowledge the book isn’t perfect, its flaws feel minor in the grand scheme of things. The constant repetition of certain character descriptions (e.g., Worm’s mismatched eyes) became excessive. Additionally, Dior’s love story felt rushed toward the end and could have been better paced.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  Even with its flaws, the book feels perfect to me. Its imperfections add to its charm, and I wouldn’t change a thing. The series holds a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to see where it goes next.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece in my eyes, blending dark, tormented vampire lore with exquisite prose and stunning illustrations. While it has minor flaws, they only enhance its appeal. I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of vampire fantasy and those who appreciate rich, immersive storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive."

It would have created a full story arc, and the break in storytelling would have felt natural given where “book 3” picks up. However, I understand the shift in narration needed for section 3, which was interesting.  \n\n- **Engagement and Investment:**  \n  I loved this book! It was a great second installment that avoided the sophomore slump. I was fully engaged, invested, and excited by the revelations throughout this part of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narration:**  \n  I really enjoy Jay Kristoff’s writing style. I was initially worried about the addition of a second storyteller, but it worked out beautifully.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Messy characters make me love the story even more. I enjoy all the drama and complicated relationships/friendships. The author delivers moments that made me gasp. I also appreciated how some side characters became main players in this book.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is exceptional! In book 1, the interviewer made the main character explain the world for the sake of the story. This continues here, but with each reveal and plot twist, we learn more about this richly crafted world. I absolutely love it!  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  As noted in my review of book 1, I didn’t enjoy the misogyny, which is standard to European medieval feudalism centered around religious orthodoxy. While it’s an adult fantasy with cursing and mature themes, the excess of misogyny is never fun to read. However, given the Catholic-inspired setting, its presence is understandable.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the 🏳️‍🌈 representation in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some structural confusion and the presence of misogyny, *Empire of the Damned* is a fantastic second book that kept me engaged and invested.

I am beyond thankful to be chosen as an ARC reader, though I’m now sad/mad at myself for having to wait even longer for the third book.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  I actually enjoyed the \"Storyteller POV\" and the transitions between past and present. While some readers might not care for this style, I found it easy to follow and kept track of everything happening without difficulty.  \n\n- **Plot Continuity and Development:**  \n  The story picks up right where the first book, *EOTV*, leaves off, and we don’t miss a thing. The direction of the story was clear, but there were several surprises I didn’t see coming, which I loved. It’s not predictable, and that kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The book had me emotionally invested from start to finish. It’s witty, funny, and had me rooting for the underdog while wishing bad things on Gabriel’s enemies. Some scenes were touching and had me deeply in my feels. My emotions were on a roller coaster, and I never wanted the ride to end.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The only thing I didn’t like was that the book ended. I was so immersed in the story that I literally said, “WTH, it’s over!?” out loud when I reached the end.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you loved the first book, you have to read this one! It’s a must-read for fans of a good vampire series, redemption stories, love, and the will to survive. I highly recommend it to anyone who will listen to me rave about it.  \n\n- **Author and Publisher Appreciation:**  \n  I want to thank St. Martin’s Press for granting me the privilege of reading this book early. Jay Kristoff deserves every ounce of praise he gets, and I’m absolutely stoked for the next installment in this series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel was an emotional, engaging, and unpredictable ride that lived up to my high expectations.

The novel doesn’t shy away from torture or humanity, blending the decadent sumptuosity of Catholicism with the feral oddness of Pictish Scotland.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  While I admire Dior’s gutter rat resilience, her 21st-century sensibilities feel out of place. Her naivety doesn’t suit her, and I’m left wondering if she’s a survivor or a social justice warrior.  \n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Authenticity:**  \n  As a French reader, I appreciate Kristoff’s use of the French language, which is rare and well-executed.  \n\n- **Storytelling Mastery:**  \n  Kristoff is a master storyteller, moving with gravitas and never apologizing for the breadth of his vision.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a bold, ambitious, and horrifying masterpiece that delves deeply into vampire mythology while blending rich cultural and historical elements. While the protagonist’s modern sensibilities feel slightly out of place, the overall storytelling is exceptional, and the use of French is a delightful touch.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It's crucial to read the first book beforehand, as the story is designed to be experienced as a cohesive set. This installment features several intriguing twists and unresolved mysteries. For example, Joaquin is revealed to be Dario, Jean-Francois' love interest. I suspect that Celene and Gabriel are feigning their animosity, adding an interesting layer to their relationship. The revelation of Phoebe’s husband being killed is a significant plot point, while Aaron and Baptiste seem to have found their happily ever after, which is satisfying. Dior’s death remains ambiguous; I suspect she may have transformed into a vampire or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm also curious about the unresolved storyline involving Celene and Mother Marlyn.",

This series is a must-read for fans of dark, vampire-centric stories like Blade and Underworld.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

It’s an emotional roller coaster that had me gasping, crying, and laughing multiple times. The last 200 pages were particularly gripping, and I couldn’t put the book down. I even got the audiobook to keep listening when I couldn’t read.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The banter between Gabe and Dior had me laughing out loud, and their relationship development was heart-wrenching because, as the book reminds us, “nice doesn’t last long here.” The dynamic between Jean-Francois and Gabe was especially hilarious—those two need to get a room! I also enjoyed the dual POVs, and despite Celene potentially being the biggest evil in the world, I found myself liking her.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was more focused on one major event, which I appreciated. Jay continued with the interview style but honed in on a significant part of their journey. The plot was unpredictable, with characters being written into seemingly impossible, deathly situations that kept me on edge.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Creativity:**  \n  Jay has the courage to put his characters in dire situations with no easy way out, making it hard to predict what will happen or to whom. The heartbreak, the horrible moments, and the impossible scenarios were the best parts of the book.  \n\n- **Series Continuation:**  \n  I’m obsessed with this series. Book one was great, but book two is even better. That ending left me desperate for book three—I need it now!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterful blend of heartbreak, humor, and unpredictability.

The cliffhanger ending leaves readers eagerly anticipating the next book.",

Both male and female characters are written with depth, allowing for vulnerability, failure, and growth. The book features strong LGBT+ characters in positions of power, such as the vampire interviewer and characters like Aaron and Baptiste, who defy stereotypes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Fascination with Vampires:**  \n  I am deeply in love with the figure of the vampire—fascinating and bloodthirsty creatures that intrigue with their charm and predatory nature. However, over the years, this figure has unfortunately diminished, especially when poorly executed romance has interfered, turning them into mere Swarovski trinkets.  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Style:**  \n  Jay Kristoff is, in my opinion, a genius. Since his Nevernight trilogy, I knew he had a keen eye, and I fell in love with his work. His writing in the third person is another reason to adore him, as it adds to the joy of reading.  \n\n- **Anticipation and Excitement:**  \n  I eagerly awaited the second volume of this new series, checking monthly for updates. When it was finally announced, I was ecstatic and dove into it immediately upon release.  \n\n- **Plot and Continuity:**  \n  *L’impero dei Dannati* picks up right where *L’impero del Vampiro* left off, following Gabriel, his sister Liathe, and Dior as they continue their journey. Gabriel is imprisoned after attacking Jean-François Chastain, while Liathe heads to a monastery in search of one of the last Esani. Their journey is fraught with danger as they are pursued by the Terrors, and complications arise when Gabriel and Dior stop in the city of Avelène.  \n\n- **Complexity and Pacing:**  \n  The book is rich with twists and turns, keeping the reader on edge. Just when you think things are calming down, a sudden event throws everything into chaos, making it hard to keep up at times. I prefer intense books over flat ones, but the rapid pacing and abrupt ending left me craving the third volume immediately.  \n\n- **Character and World-Building:**  \n  The story is filled with complex characters, intricate names, and unique details. I even kept a notebook to track everything as I read. This second volume, like the first, is packed with surprises and depth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJay Kristoff has once again delivered a gripping and intense novel that leaves readers desperate for more. While the rapid pacing and abrupt ending are slightly frustrating, the richness of the story and characters makes it a must-read. I eagerly await the third volume and highly recommend catching up on the first two books in the meantime.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

His overwhelming capacity for love leads him to make questionable choices. Flawed, prideful, and driven by mortal sins, he is portrayed with such depth that I can't help but admire him. The author not only crafts badass characters but also intricately explores their emotions and inner lives, making them feel almost real in my mind.",

            "This book shattered my heart in every way, leaving me utterly broken. It’s a tale of love, but not the kind that ends happily. The overwhelming sense of loss had me feeling tortured by the author’s beautifully painful prose. With each page I turned, I braced myself for the emotional toll, yet I was compelled to continue.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book tore my heart in every way and left me broken. It’s full of love, but not the happy-ending kind. There’s too much loss, and I felt tortured over and over again by Jay Kristoff’s beautiful yet painful writing. Every page I turned, I knew it would absolutely kill me, yet I was here for it. This book hurt me so badly that I feel like I’ll never be whole again.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Jay Kristoff’s way of building characters is exceptional. Gabriel De Léon is the best-written character I’ve ever encountered. He loves too much, which makes him do bad things. He’s flawed, imperfect, prideful, and driven by all mortal sins, yet Kristoff wrote him so perfectly that I can’t help but love him. Kristoff not only made his characters badass but also unraveled their emotions and inner worlds beautifully and realistically. They feel almost real in my head.  \n\n- **Themes of Love:**  \n  I love how Kristoff wrote about love—not just between couples, but also siblings and family. The idea that “sometimes family is not just about blood” was shown very well in the book. Gabriel’s love for Dior, his apprentice, and his brothers, as well as the love among people in their darkest times, was deeply moving. The indescribable sibling love between Gabriel and his sister was described perfectly.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  This book is dark—darker than the first one—and full of depression, but I love it so much. The finale battle made it all worth it. The betrayals, lies, and plot twists as Gabriel slowly figured out who he actually is and who his sister is were gripping.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  Usually, I like fantasy books with fighting scenes. This one doesn’t have that many battles and wars, but it still killed me emotionally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece that evokes a love-hate relationship. It’s emotionally devastating yet beautifully written, with exceptional character development and profound themes of love. The dark tone, gripping plot twists, and emotional depth make it unforgettable. You have to read it to understand why I have so much love for it despite the pain it caused.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5. Outstanding."

            "The first 300 pages of the book were disappointing, marked by an unengaging plot and a lack of character development. The introduction of the Esani master felt underwhelming and poorly executed. However, the author’s decision to shift the narrative perspective away from Gabe was a brilliant move that revitalized the story and raised new questions. The final 100 pages were exceptional, featuring an epic battle, unexpected plot twists, character revelations, and significant deaths, culminating in a perfect conclusion. While the first half of the book fell short, especially compared to the first installment—which remains my all-time favorite—the second half more than compensated for the slow start, delivering a thrilling and satisfying experience.",
            "Gabe's character comes across as inconsistent and overly edgy, with dialogue that often feels forced and repetitive (e.g., \"Who the fuck told you I was a hero?\"). I found it hard to connect with his actions and emotions, especially his lack of guilt or remorse for his treatment of Dior, which felt unrealistic. While Dior's perspective was at times dull, it did improve as the story unfolded. In contrast, the romance between Phoebe and Gabriel was beautifully crafted, depicting two broken souls finding solace in one another."

        "conclusion": "While the first half of the book fell short of expectations, particularly in terms of character development and plot engagement, the second half was a masterful turnaround. The shift in perspective, the beautifully crafted romance, and the epic final act elevated the story significantly. Despite its flaws, the book was a compelling read, and I eagerly anticipate the third installment.",

However, I found Celene's perspective as the moth watching Dior to be my least favorite part. That ending was absolutely shocking! I can't believe it—when is book three coming out? I need it now! I finally finished *Empire of the Damned*, which is quite lengthy; it took me three weeks to read due to my limited free time. The middle felt particularly dense, and I struggled to remember many of the details.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is my first dark fantasy series, and I absolutely loved it. There's so much blood, violence, and chaos—all the good stuff. There's even some sprinkles of romance, but this is NOT romantasy.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  I can't believe I finally finished *Empire of the Damned*. It's SO LONG. It took me three weeks to read (due to not having much free time). The whole middle of the book felt quite long and dense. I can't remember a good chunk of the details provided.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Words cannot describe how much I love Gabe. Any part with him was my favorite. He's hilarious, a ruined mess, but so lovable. Dior was SO ANNOYING at times. JUST LISTEN TO GABE. Phoebe was the real MVP, and I went from not caring about her to LOVING HER so much!!\n\n- **Plot Continuity and Structure:**  \n  The story picks up where *Empire of the Vampire* left off. The author even provides us with a summary of events of book 1 at the beginning, which is so amazing. I vote that all authors, especially of fantasy, do this!!\n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  Celene's POV as the moth watching Dior was my least favorite part.\n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for the Next Book:**  \n  I CANNOT believe that crazy ending. OMG. When is book 3 coming out?! I need it now!!\n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  - \"We only die if we are forgotten. Burn bright. Burn brief. But burn.\"  \n  - \"The right book is worth a hundred blades.\"  \n  - \"Love is madness – or so the poets say – and a lover will do near anything to please their beloved.\"  \n  - \"No fear. Only fury.\"  \n  - \"This world won’t give you what you want just because you asked nicely, girl. Not respect. Not love. Not peace. You get what you earn. You eat what you kill.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Empire of the Damned* was excellent. After spending so much time with it and these characters, I have a massive book hangover and miss them already. There was just so much that happened that this review would be 10 pages long if I went into detail.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

However, this series stands out as a fantastic example of what the genre can achieve when done well. It embodies the best qualities of the genre, which are often rare to find.\n\n- **Violence and Content:**  \n  I’ll admit, the level of violence in these books is much too intense for my usual preferences.

He excels at creating a detailed and consistent fantasy universe with a clear set of rules, and he cleverly works within that framework without ever breaking it. This level of craftsmanship is unmatched by most authors currently working in the genre.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  Despite being a 700+ page doorstopper, the book reads incredibly fast.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Consistency and Author Performance:**  \n  Mr. Kristoff is 2 for 2 in this series, maintaining a high standard of storytelling. The books are substantial in length, which I appreciate, and the inclusion of a \"Who's who\" section at the beginning is incredibly helpful for keeping track of the extensive cast of characters.\n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook, and Damian Lynch delivered an outstanding performance. Shakira Shute did an okay job, but Lynch truly stood out. However, I feel that experiencing the illustrations in the printed and ebook versions adds significant value to the story, so I alternated between reading and listening once I discovered their presence.\n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n  This book introduces a new perspective from Gabriel's sister, Celene, a complex and unpredictable vampire. Her motives remain ambiguous throughout the story, and even by the end, I’m still unsure where her loyalties lie. This adds a layer of intrigue and depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Plot Continuity and Pacing:**  \n  The story picks up right where the first book left off, diving into Gabriel and Celene’s journey to save the Holy Grail while being held captive by the Vampire Empress. The plot is fast-paced and filled with revelations, but it also introduces new mysteries and uncertainties, keeping me engaged and curious.\n\n- **Ending and Cliffhanger:**  \n  The book concludes with a surprising cliffhanger, which I absolutely loved. It’s rare for a book to deliver such a satisfying and unexpected twist, and it left me eager for the next installment.\n\n- **Series Comparison and Overall Appeal:**  \n  A book reviewer once described this series as \"If Twilight was kindergarten, then this series is your PhD.\" I find this analogy fitting. The series is intellectually stimulating, compelling, and undeniably intense, making it a standout in its genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a worthy successor to the first in the series, delivering a complex and engaging narrative with well-developed characters, a fast-paced plot, and a thrilling cliffhanger. The addition of Celene’s perspective adds depth, and the audiobook performance, combined with the illustrations, enhances the overall experience. This series is a must-read for fans of intricate and intense storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75 Stars 🌟"

            "The language was essential to the story. While I'm not a prude, the repeated use of phrases like \"fuck my face\" took some getting used to. However, I can confidently say that this raw language was not just necessary; it was crucial for conveying the characters' trials and tribulations.",
            "After nearly 60 hours immersed in these two books, I feel as though a piece of my soul has been torn away upon finishing the story. I loved every moment of it, but now I’m left furious at having to wait for the third installment.",
            "In a long time, I haven’t encountered a truly remarkable vampire book. However, labeling this story solely as a vampire book would be a disservice to its author. It transcends genre, weaving a rich tapestry that includes vampires, Silver Saints (half vampires), shape-shifters, and much more. This tale offers an excellent reading experience that is far beyond what a typical vampire story can provide."

I absolutely loved it all. Now, I am FURIOUS that I have to wait for #3.\n\n- **Language and Style:**  \n  The language was necessary. I am not a prude by any means, but the \"fuck my face\" and other choice phrases and words on repeat took me a bit to get used to. Now, I can say with absolute certainty that it was NEEDED... or better yet... REQUIRED for this story and all the trials and tribulations they faced.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  I have not read a deep down GOOD vampire book in a very long time. But if this was only a vampire book, that would be where I end this review. This is SO MUCH MORE than just a VAMPIRE book. To merely put it in that category would be a huge disservice to this author. This is a WORLD of so many different things combined that makes one EXCELLENT read. Vampires, Silver Saints (half vampires), Shape Shifters, ETC....\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend this series for anyone who loves world-building. Now, I am going to try and find something to sate my bloodthirsty soul.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis series is a masterful blend of rich world-building, compelling characters, and raw, necessary language that elevates the story. It transcends the vampire genre, offering a multifaceted and immersive experience that leaves a lasting emotional impact.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was able to keep up with everything much better this time, and I even started guessing plot points the moment they were foreshadowed, no matter how subtle. The tension and pacing were masterfully done, and it kept me hooked throughout.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pace in the last 200 pages was fantastic. It became such a page-turner that even with my poor attention span, I was completely locked in. I read 50 pages without even realizing it, and suddenly, the book was over, leaving me craving more.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book gave me the same intense feeling as certain deaths in *KOA* (no further comment). It was an emotional rollercoaster, and I’m already dreading the wait for the third installment because this story is all I can think about.\n\n- **Writing Style and Detail:**  \n  Jay Kristoff’s ability to write gory, minute details is both impressive and unsettling. For example, the scene where someone’s hand is knifed to the wall and then ripped free, losing half of their hand and three fingers, was so vividly described that it bothered me more than entire violent battle scenes. His attention to detail is both a strength and a source of discomfort.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a thrilling and emotionally charged read that surpassed the first installment in every way. The pacing, tension, and vivid writing kept me hooked, and I’m already eagerly anticipating the next book. Despite the gory details that left me unsettled, I couldn’t put it down.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

At one point, there were four instances in the space of two pages, which was irritating.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Author:**  \n  - Kristoff excels at crafting a compelling narrative with intriguing characters, a deeply realized world, and numerous blindsiding plot twists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had some pacing issues, lower stakes, and a few narrative and editing quirks, it still delivered a thrilling story and set the stage for an exciting conclusion to the trilogy. Kristoff’s strengths in storytelling and world-building kept me engaged, and I’m eager to see how the series ends.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Jean-Francois is intriguing, especially with his sketches featured in the book. Celene (Liathe) is my favorite character; her mysterious aura and rare blood gifts create an air of intrigue. The plot and characters are utterly captivating. Gabriel's abrupt and unrefined nature is oddly charming, and I find myself completely obsessed with him. Dior's growth throughout the book is both beautiful and inspiring, despite the many ups and downs she faces. The relationship between Gabriel and Dior evolves wonderfully, shifting from a sense of responsibility to a heartwarming father-daughter bond.",

His ability to make the cruelty of the world feel palpable is unmatched, and I find myself deeply invested in the story.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative is told through Gabriel retelling his story to a historian while being a captive, with the addition of his sister Celene’s narration in this book. The small inconsistencies between their retellings add layers to the characters’ personalities and make the storytelling feel clever and compelling. Gabriel’s dramatic flair in his retellings is both hilarious and endearing.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Gabriel and Dior’s relationship continues to evolve beautifully, scratching my Gruff-father-and-Sassy-loud-mouth-daughter itch. Their dynamic is reminiscent of Ellie and Joel from *The Last of Us*, and their reunion scene was absolutely perfect.  \n  The romance between Gabriel and Phoebe was a surprising but welcome addition, as they share similar personalities and perspectives on life.  \n  Jean-François and Gabriel’s chemistry is charming and funny, and I’m eager to see how their relationship develops further.  \n  Reyne and Dior’s budding relationship is another aspect I’m excited to explore in the next book.\n\n- **Humor and Dialogue:**  \n  Kristoff’s insults and swears are a highlight, adding humor and authenticity to the dialogue. Phrases like “fuck my face,” “fuck weasel,” “twatgoblin,” and “twat waffle” had me laughing out loud and wanting to incorporate them into my daily vocabulary.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The betrayal by Isla was a gut punch, and I didn’t see it coming.  \n  The revelation about the Wolf Prince being Connor was a surprise, though in retrospect, it feels obvious.  \n  The ending with Joaquinn was thrilling, and I’m excited to see how Gabriel’s escape plan unfolds.  \n  The emotional devastation of Gabriel losing another child and holding Dior’s corpse was heart-wrenching. Kristoff’s ability to evoke such strong emotions is both a strength and a curse.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The world is filled with hopelessness and brutality, which makes the story feel raw and real. Themes of cruelty, trauma, and the cyclical nature of violence are explored in a way that adds depth to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* is a masterfully crafted sequel that builds on the strengths of the first book. Jay Kristoff’s cinematic writing, clever narrative structure, and deeply emotional character relationships make this a standout fantasy novel.

The thrilling battles kept me on the edge of my seat, and the emotional moments were so impactful that they brought me to tears.",
            "The author skillfully introduced new perspectives that enriched our understanding of the world and added depth to existing characters, making them more complex and engaging. Gabriel’s point of view was particularly captivating, though some new perspectives felt unbalanced and less immersive. For the next book, I would love to see additional viewpoints, such as Dior’s—who has emerged as an intriguing, flawed hero—a perspective from the duskdancers for cultural context, and another from the Chastains to create a more nuanced villain, despite Jean-François’ perspective already being well-executed.",

Instead, it allows the author to delve deeper into the narrative, expanding on the world and characters.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The author added new POVs to broaden our understanding of the world and gave existing characters new layers, making them more complex and engaging.

The narrative unfolds across two timelines: one featuring prisoner Gabe and the other following Dior's quest for the grail. The shift in perspective from Gabriel to Jean-François adds an intriguing layer to the storytelling. Gabriel's former apprentice, Lachlan, joins the group, and their relationship is rich with history, inside jokes, and a strong bond. Gabriel's dark secret creates tension and sets the stage for future conflict. While the sample includes two battles, neither is particularly spectacular, though the action remains enjoyable. Gabe's clever strategy in the second battle is a standout moment.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  The novel is set in one of the most nightmarish post-apocalyptic worlds I've ever encountered, where survival feels impossible for both the characters and the reader. The depiction of humans as cattle for the Blood Dyvok vampires is particularly disturbing, creating a sense of utter hopelessness.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is brutal, bloody, and unapologetically dark, even more so than its predecessor. It’s a harsh and painful read, but it also manages to weave in moments of excitement and intrigue amidst the violence and horror.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot:**  \n  Learning more about the shapeshifters from the Ossiann Highlands was a definite highlight, with those sections standing out as some of my favorites. The ending was phenomenal, packed with tension, action, and unexpected twists.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The interview-style narrative, with Gabriel recounting his tale to a Vampire chronicler, occasionally pulled me out of the immersion and isn’t my favorite format. However, the story’s intensity more than makes up for this.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The novel is raw, sexy, and captivating, taking readers on a wild ride that leaves them feeling a little worse for wear by the end. It’s a dark fantasy that doesn’t hold back, delivering a painful yet compelling experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmpire of the Damned is a brutal yet captivating dark fantasy that pushes the boundaries of its genre. While the narrative style may not be for everyone, the intense story, rich world-building, and shocking twists make it a must-read for fans of unflinching dark fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars"

            "\"Empire of the Damned\" effectively fulfills the role of a middle chapter in a trilogy, expanding on the groundwork laid in \"Empire of the Vampire.\" The story intensifies the brutality established in the first book, delivering even more shocking twists and turns. While some plot developments were predictable, others took me completely by surprise. The cliffhanger at the end leaves readers eagerly anticipating the final installment of the trilogy.",
            "This book offers a deeper understanding of Dior's character and mindset, while also revealing Laithe's identity, which was hinted at towards the end of *Empire of the Vampire*. Furthermore, it provides greater insight into Jean Francois's motivations and his life beyond the prison cell with Gabriel."

        "conclusion": "Empire of the Damned successfully builds on its predecessor, delivering a darker, more intense narrative with deeper character insights and well-crafted villains. While it lacks a standout villain moment like in the first book, its brutal twists and compelling storytelling make it a worthy continuation of the trilogy.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Continuity and Progression as a Middle Chapter:**  \n  Empire of the Damned accomplishes exactly what the middle chapter of a trilogy is supposed to do. It builds on the foundation set by the introductions of Gabriel and Dior's stories in Empire of the Vampire and cranks things up a notch. The book gets even more brutal than the first one, which is saying a lot.\n\n- **Storytelling Structure:**  \n  Initially, I was a little worried about this book not having flashbacks like the first volume did. However, Mr. Kristoff pivots to a slightly different storytelling structure for multiple sections of the book, which worked as a good alternative for me.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  This book provides much more insight into Dior's character and mindset. It also delivers on the revelation of Laithe's identity, which was hinted at near the end of Empire of the Vampire. Additionally, the reader gets a deeper look at Jean Francois's motivations and life outside of the prison cell with Gabriel.\n\n- **Villains and Antagonists:**  \n  The main villains of this volume are terrifying and well-written. However, they never have a scene that is quite as memorable or impactful as Fabien Voss's sequence in the first novel.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Pacing:**  \n  Kristoff does not pull any punches in this book, with some brutal twists and turns. Some of these I saw coming, while others completely blindsided me. The cliffhanger at the end is going to make for a long and impatient wait for the final volume of the trilogy.\n\n- **Comparison to the First Book:**  \n  I find myself going back and forth between which of the first two books I like more, which is an excellent problem to have. If you enjoyed Empire of the Vampire, I do not see how you would not end up enjoying Empire of the Damned as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmpire of the Damned successfully builds on its predecessor, delivering a darker, more intense narrative with deeper character insights and well-crafted villains. While it lacks a standout villain moment like in the first book, its brutal twists and compelling storytelling make it a worthy continuation of the trilogy.

            "In \"Gabriel de León,\" the protagonist embodies the essence of a hero—Savior of Nordlund, Sword of the Realm, and the Black Lion. This is not a day for his demise.

            "In this gripping narrative, I experienced the visceral sensation of teeth piercing skin and bones shattering, leading to a scream that was both piercing and filled with anguish—an expression of fear intertwined with profound rage. \"Dior, my baby girl, count your days!\" encapsulates the tumultuous emotions of hating the very thing that completes you while simultaneously loving what ultimately destroys you."

            "The sequel picks up seamlessly from the first book, continuing Gabe’s present-day narration of his life and journey with Dior. A significant addition is the introduction of a second perspective, offering a fresh viewpoint on the Grail story. This shift is both intriguing and informative, emphasizing the potential unreliability of the narrators—whether it’s Gabriel, the new narrator, or both. This narrative choice encourages readers to think critically about the text and question what they take at face value, which I found compelling.",
            "This book strengthened my connection to several characters, especially the duskwalkers, who are among the most captivating groups in the story. I developed a surprising fondness for one character, intensifying my anxiety for their safety. The ever-present fear of character deaths or worse fates raised the emotional stakes significantly, particularly since I had already formed attachments in the first book.",
            "The sequel enhances the world-building by delving into the unique group introduced, providing valuable insights into their culture and people. A standout moment occurs in a chilling forest scene that delivers unexpected horror elements, keeping me engaged throughout those chapters. Overall, the book is immersive, featuring a masterfully crafted world that left me deeply invested.",
            "This book took me on an intense emotional rollercoaster, evoking everything from joy and wonder to deep sadness and nail-biting tension. The ending was agonizing, leaving me with a profound sense of loss and a cliffhanger even more gripping than the first. Now, I'm experiencing a severe book hangover, unable to dive into another story and eagerly awaiting the next installment.",
            "This sequel is just as captivating and action-packed as *Empire of the Vampire*. It’s nearly impossible to put down, filled with relentless danger and a pervasive sense of anxiety that keeps every character on edge. This unpredictability permeates the entire narrative, making it impossible to look away from the unfolding events."

        "conclusion": "*Empire of the Damned* is a phenomenal sequel that builds on the strengths of its predecessor while introducing new layers of intrigue, character depth, and emotional intensity. The narrative’s unpredictability, combined with its immersive world-building and heart-wrenching stakes, makes it a must-read. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn’t started it yet—it’s an unforgettable journey.",

It was incredibly hard to put down, with non-stop danger and a constant sense of anxiety that no character was ever safe. This feeling of unpredictability hung over the entire sequel, making it impossible to turn away from the events unfolding on the page.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspective:**  \n  The story picks up right where the first book left off, continuing Gabe’s present-day narration of his life and his journey with Dior. A notable addition in this sequel is the introduction of a second perspective, which provides a different viewpoint on the story of the Grail. This shift was intriguing and informative, as it highlighted the potential unreliability of the narrators—whether it’s Gabriel, the second narrator, or both. This narrative choice forces readers to think critically about what they’re reading and not take everything at face value, which I found compelling.\n\n- **Character Development and Attachment:**  \n  The book deepened my attachment to certain characters, particularly the duskwalkers, who are one of the most intriguing groups in the series. I grew unexpectedly fond of a specific character, which only heightened my anxiety for their well-being. The constant dread of characters dying or facing worse fates made the emotional stakes incredibly high, especially since I had already grown attached to them in the first book.\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  The sequel expanded on the world-building, particularly with the duskwalkers, offering more insight into their culture and people. A standout moment was a sequence set in a spooky forest, which had unexpected horror vibes and kept me hooked for those chapters. The entire book was immersive, with a masterfully crafted world that left me deeply invested.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The emotional rollercoaster of this book was intense. It evoked a wide range of emotions, from happiness and awe to sadness and breath-holding tension. The ending left me in agony, with a sense of incredible loss and a cliffhanger that was even more gripping than the first book. I’m now in a severe book hangover, unable to move on to another story and desperate for the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* is a phenomenal sequel that builds on the strengths of *Empire of the Vampire* while introducing new layers of intrigue, character depth, and emotional intensity. The narrative’s unpredictability, combined with its immersive world-building and heart-wrenching stakes, makes it a must-read.

            "Isla's betrayal caught me completely off guard. Dior's attempt to help her turned out to be a mistake. The revelation that Dario is actually Joaquin was a fantastic plot twist! Since he was healed by Dior's blood, he can't be thralled by vampires, making him a valuable ally for Gabriel against the Chastain. I suspected Dario would play a significant role, given how frequently his name was mentioned and Gabriel's keen awareness of him.",
            "Dior demonstrates remarkable resilience as she endures the harsh realities of the Dyvoks. I appreciated her transformation from a naive character who shunned her role as the Grail to one who is now determined to fight for a better future. Gabriel's quest to find and save her leads him to enlist the help of the dusk dancers, who turned out to be intriguing characters. Initially, I was wary of Phoebe, but she has become one of my favorites, and I hope she and Gabriel end up together.",
            "In this story, vampires view humans much like we once viewed cattle—merely as food and prey. This perspective understandably disturbs humans, but it also offers a thought-provoking context, especially since humans once hunted vampires. As we delve deeper into the lore, we uncover the surprising origins of vampires, which raises even more questions about Fábien Voss, the oldest living vampire. He clearly knows more than he reveals, particularly regarding his interest in keeping Dior alive. What are his true intentions? Additionally, the book confirms my suspicions about his bisexuality, a trait shared by many vampires, which adds depth to his character.",
            "After centuries of relying on human blood for sustenance, can we still consider vampires as people? This thought-provoking question highlights how time erodes not only humanity but also moral values. Despite his flaws, Fábien Voss is not the villain I despise the most; his love for his children adds a complex layer to his character. He may be a monster, but his care for his kids is undeniable.",
            "The grief I experienced upon finishing this book was profound. It's an epic tale steeped in pain and sorrow, leaving me in anguish at the end. The conclusion was particularly heartbreaking, especially since Dior's fate could have been avoided had Gabriel and Celene not been at odds.",
            "I'm genuinely surprised by the epilogue. How did Dior survive? I guess we'll find out in the next book! There's still more to uncover, especially regarding how Gabriel defeated the Forever King."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The grief I felt ending this book was something else. It's an epic tale, but it's full of pain and sorrow. I was in pain when I finished. The ending was so sad, especially since what happened to Dior could've been avoided if Gabriel and Celene hadn't been fighting.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Dior showed great strength, being able to survive the brutal Dyvoks. I really enjoyed how she started as a naive character who wanted nothing to do with being the Grail and now she wants to fight for a better future. Gabriel has to track her down and save her, and for that, he ends up requesting the help of the dusk dancers, who proved to be very interesting characters. I initially was suspicious of Phoebe, but she's one of my faves now, and I do hope she and Gabriel get together.\n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  Dior's budding romance with Princess Reyle was super sweet. I hope for a reunion in the next book! Meanwhile, Jean François feels an attraction to Gabriel, despite being his enemy. The scene of him shaving Gabriel's beard really plays into how he desires him.\n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The vampires see humans the same way we used to see cattle—to them, we're food, prey. It upsets humans, obviously, but it puts some things in perspective, especially since in this universe, humans used to hunt vampires. We learn more about the vampires, especially how they were created. It was very surprising to find out, and I must admit the more we know about this, the more questions I have about Fábien Voss. He's the oldest vampire alive and knows more than he lets on. After all, he wants Dior alive. So...what could he want with her? This book also revealed he's bi, like most vampires, which I always suspected. He had the vibe.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Surprises:**  \n  Isla's betrayal was something I didn't see coming. Dior tried to help her, and that was a mistake. Dario being Joaquin was actually a great plot twist! He can't be thralled to vampires since he was healed by Dior's blood, so he'll be an ally to Gabriel against the Chastain. I noticed Dario was going to be important because his name was mentioned a lot, and Gabriel was awfully aware of who he was, so I knew that was going to mean something.\n\n- **Complex Relationships:**  \n  The debate between Gabriel and Celene is rather complicated. They're both unreliable narrators who have teased to hate each other and who have hurt one another... though they both seek the same goal. In the end, it's a very complicated sibling relationship. Jean François has a past of abuse, and in a way, it makes sense why he wanted to become a vampire. He's an artist and wanted a chance to live forever, despite how much his father told him he'd never be good for anything. In a way, Margot treats him as her own son.\n\n- **Themes and Morality:**  \n  After centuries of having to drink human blood for sustenance, would you still be thinking they're people? It's an interesting thing to think about. In a way, everything erodes with time, including humanity and morals. For all his faults, Fábien Voss is still not the villain I hate the most because of how he cares for his kids. He's a monster, but he does love his kids.\n\n- **Unresolved Questions and Future Expectations:**  \n  I'm honestly quite surprised at the epilogue. How did Dior live? I suppose we'll know in the next book! There's more story to tell as well, after all, we still don't know how Gabriel killed the Forever King.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a deeply emotional and complex tale filled with pain, sorrow, and surprising twists. The characters are well-developed, and their relationships are intricate and compelling. The world-building is rich, and the moral dilemmas presented are thought-provoking. While the ending left me with many questions, I am eagerly anticipating the next installment to see how the story unfolds.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot was a dark, captivating journey that kept me thoroughly engaged. It unfolded beautifully, with unexpected twists that left me eager for the next installment. The ending was both shocking and masterfully executed, particularly the revelation about Dario and Joaquin, which completely blindsided me despite earlier clues. While I initially liked Dior, her character became less appealing as the story progressed, largely due to her naivety and poor decision-making. The sibling dynamics, especially between Gabriel and Celene, added compelling emotional depth to the narrative. However, the excessive focus on romantic relationships, particularly between Dior and Reyne, detracted from the overall plot and felt unnecessary.",
            "I appreciated the inclusion of the Dramatis Personae at the beginning, as it helped refresh my memory of the characters from the first book. Gabriel remains a morally ambiguous, short-tempered drunkard, and I love him for it. His vulgarity, which I typically dislike, suits his character perfectly, and I found it fitting in this installment. I thoroughly enjoyed his bickering with Jean-François, though their interactions often hinted at underlying danger. \n\nOne of my main criticisms is the excessive focus on romance, which sometimes overshadowed the fantasy elements. While I loved Aaron and Baptiste's story in the first book, their relationship in this installment felt overly sentimental and unrealistic. Baptiste's ability to save Aaron through love came across as absurd and out of place. I also found Dior's naivety frustrating, particularly her misguided belief in her own revolution, which ultimately led to her team's downfall. \n\nOn a positive note, I was intrigued by Celene and her complex relationship with Gabriel, which added depth to the narrative. The loyalty of the Silversaints and Silversisters to Gabriel was a highlight, showcasing their willingness to sacrifice for him."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - I appreciated the Dramatis Personae at the start, as it helped refresh my memory of the characters from the first book.\n  - Gabriel remains a morally-grey, short-tempered drunkard, and I love him for it. His vulgarity, which I usually dislike, fits his character perfectly, and I didn’t mind it in this book either.\n  - I thoroughly enjoyed Gabriel’s bickering with Jean-François, though their interactions often hint at danger.\n  - One of my main criticisms is the overemphasis on romance, which sometimes overshadowed the fantasy elements. Aaron and Baptiste’s story, which I loved in the first book, felt overly sappy and unrealistic in this installment. Their relationship, especially Baptiste’s ability to save Aaron through love, felt absurd and out of place.\n  - I found Dior’s naivety frustrating, especially her misguided belief in her own revolution, which led to her team’s downfall. However, I was intrigued by Celene and her complex relationship with Gabriel, which added depth to the story.\n  - The Silversaints and Silversisters’ loyalty to Gabriel was a highlight, showcasing their willingness to die for him.\n\n- **Plot:**\n  - The plot was a dark, cruel, and fascinating ride that kept me hooked. It built up beautifully, with unexpected twists and turns that left me eager for the next book.\n  - The ending was shocking and masterfully executed. I was completely blindsided by the revelation about Dario and Joaquin, despite the clues provided earlier.\n  - While I initially liked Dior, her character became less appealing as the story progressed, particularly due to her naivety and poor decision-making.\n  - The sibling dynamics, especially between Gabriel and Celene, were compelling and added emotional depth to the narrative.\n  - The excessive focus on romantic relationships, particularly between Dior and Reyne, detracted from the overall plot and felt unnecessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some criticisms, particularly regarding the overemphasis on romance and certain character decisions, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Jay Kristoff’s writing continues to captivate me, and the dark, intricate plot left me eagerly anticipating the next installment. The shocking ending and complex character relationships were standout elements that made this a memorable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Celine's perspective adds depth to the narrative, highlighting the subtle differences in how they remember their journey. Her mysterious powers and unwavering devotion to the Redeemer make her an intriguing character, enriching the story beyond Gabriel's viewpoint. Another standout character is Phoebe, a fierce tribal woman who develops a romance with Gabriel. Their relationship blossoms beautifully, especially in light of Gabriel's past loss and trauma. The heart of the story lies in its characters and their shared moments—tender recollections of family, stolen kisses, newfound love, and Gabriel's fatherly care for Dior.",

Her interactions with the main cast are intriguing, leaving me torn between love and disdain for her. **Gabriel:** His character continues to deepen, and I’m eager to learn more about his journey, especially the circumstances surrounding the death of the Forever King. His relationship with Dior beautifully captures the complexities of a father-daughter bond. **Dior:** As a rash and somewhat arrogant teenager, Dior proves her strength in this installment. Her fate, particularly during her imprisonment by the Dyvok, was the most nerve-wracking aspect for me. **Aaron:** His scenes were the most unsettling, and I’m heartbroken by his fate. Despite being my favorite character, his suffering is painful to witness, though I still hold out hope for his redemption.",

            "The ending of *Cesarstwo Potępionych* was nothing short of phenomenal, significantly enhancing my overall impression of the book. The climax was masterfully crafted—epic, intense, and emotionally gripping. The perfect tension, skillful narration of key events, and the sheer volume of bloodshed left me both stunned and exhilarated. Just when I thought all hope was lost, the author introduced a massive twist that created a cathartic experience. The final 10% of the book profoundly influenced my perception.\n\nHowever, the first 70% felt rather bland, suffering from the second-book curse, which was painful to endure. The story meandered, lacking a clear direction as the author explored various paths. While there were chases, explosions, and emotional moments, the cohesion present in the first book was missing. Additionally, the romance subplot felt unnecessary, adding little beyond emotional indulgence and seeming primarily included for its sexual element. Nonetheless, it was engaging and well-executed.",
            "In this installment, the relationship between Gabriel and Dior evolves into a sarcastic father-daughter dynamic, which lightens the otherwise gloomy tone of the beginning. Gabriel continues to shine as a standout character—flawed, unapologetic, and brutally honest about his own arrogance. Jean-Francois also emerges as a favorite, displaying a humor reminiscent of Gabriel's. However, Celene's point of view feels forced and pretentious, as her overly critical and servile attitude toward Dior detracts from the overall narrative.",
            "The story misses a key opportunity by failing to provide a clear origin for the vampires' evil. Although the author delves into themes of blood enslavement and blind obedience, the narrative does not adequately explain the loss of humanity among the characters. Additionally, the frequent introduction of increasingly villainous figures becomes repetitive and lacks deeper context."

The conclusion was thrilling—I couldn't help but giggle. I suspected there was something between Celene and Gabriel that they were keeping from Jean-François, and I correctly linked it to Dior, but the resolution still surprised me.

Dior, on the other hand, is a strong-willed and intelligent character. Despite facing isolation and her fear of the ancien, she persevered in her role, even when uncertain about Gabriel's fate or whether anyone believed in her. I was relieved to see Jean-François still alive, even if only temporarily. However, I found Gabriel and Phoebe's actions frustrating. While their choices were essential to the plot, I felt they jeopardized Dior's safety for their own amusement.

It has left me in a chokehold, occupying my thoughts to the point where I’ve considered charging it rent for the space it occupies in my head.\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:** If the first book, *Empire of the Vampire*, was a wild ride, this sequel hits even harder.\n- **Characterization:** Gabriel de Leon, the half-vampire, half-human protagonist, remains a foul-mouthed, brooding, tattooed, self-sacrificing hero on a quest to save his found family and the world. He’s described as so sexy that he’d go viral on Instagram Reels by breakfast.\n- **Themes and Tone:** The story is long, deep, tragic, and hopeful. It features extreme gore and bloodshed, torture, death, and bleakness, but also includes witty, hilarious dialogue, amazing friendships, beautiful found family relationships, and a touch of romance with some spice.\n- **Atmosphere and Genre:** This is the most atmospheric book I’ve ever read, and it’s shocking how much I loved it despite it being outside my normal genre.\n- **Narration (Audiobook):** The narration is the best I’ve ever heard, and I did an audio/physical combo for this book.\n- **Re-readability and Anticipation:** I am 100% rereading this series soon and have been stalking Jay Kristoff’s page for any news about the third book, especially because of the cliffhanger.\n- **Audience Suitability:** This grimdark fantasy saga won’t be for everyone, particularly those who value a good night’s sleep.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on me. It’s a gripping, atmospheric, and emotionally charged sequel that surpasses its predecessor in every way. While it’s not for the faint of heart, it’s a must-read for fans of dark, immersive fantasy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned, but the review is overwhelmingly positive, with the book being described as the best of 2024 so far."

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative switch and the fast-paced plot. Celene’s prominent role in the storytelling was a delightful surprise. The character interactions, particularly the sibling-like bickering at the end with Jean Francois stepping in, had me laughing out loud. The book skillfully focused on Blood Dyvok while keeping Fabien Voss as a looming villain, leaving me anxious for the showdown in Book 3. The twists were masterfully executed, providing answers to some questions while raising new ones. The ending left me with several burning inquiries: What’s up with Dior’s moving blood? Is she dead? What does the white moth signify? I suspect Gabriel’s attack on Celene was staged, and Joaquin’s sudden appearance? OMFG, what is happening?!",
            "The characters in this story are exceptionally well-developed, and their relationships truly shine. Aaron and Baptiste had me in tears for much of the book; I adore them. Gabriel and Phoebe's connection, especially their shared moments over Dior, was heartwarming, and I genuinely hope they find happiness and healing. Phoebe's role and the duskdancer element were particularly intriguing and well-executed, satisfying my curiosity from Book 1.",

            "The story centers on Dior, a revered figure believed to be the key to ending the vampire menace and the escalating disasters plaguing the world. The protagonist, an ordinary girl, embarks on a quest with her vampire sister—part of a cult that preys on other vampires—to uncover Dior's true purpose. Their journey leads them to a vampire who ultimately takes his own life, resulting in Dior's kidnapping by other vampires. \n\nDior is forced to drink vampire blood three times, which should render her subservient, but instead, she develops an immunity. Those healed by her blood or who consume it are liberated from their bonds. The protagonist's vampire sister manages to free Dior, but he falls into a ravine, only to be rescued by a lioness, a shapeshifter introduced earlier. They ally with her clan to confront the vampires holding Dior captive, discovering that the vampires' strength is enhanced by drinking her blood.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, it is revealed that the vampires have enslaved the lioness's husband, whom she thought was dead, but he is ultimately killed in the conflict. A climactic battle ensues, resulting in Dior's death, though hints suggest she may resurrect like Jesus. The narrative also unveils that God sent vampires as punishment for humanity's role in the death of His son, with the first vampires being priests involved in that act. This revelation deeply shakes the characters' faith.\n\nA cult begins to form around Dior's healing blood, yet several questions remain unanswered, such as the peculiar behavior of her blood in the tomb and its connection to the vampire they sought for guidance. Overall, I find the overused Jesus-like savior trope frustrating.",
            "The protagonist transforms from an ordinary girl into a pivotal figure in the fight against vampires. Dior's immunity and healing powers elevate her to a nearly messianic status. The lioness's backstory enriches the narrative, revealing her as a shapeshifter with a tragic connection to her enslaved husband. Meanwhile, the vampire sister's involvement in the cult and her actions propel key plot developments.",
            "The story delves into themes of faith, punishment, and redemption, using vampires as instruments of divine retribution for humanity's sins. Dior's blood represents healing and salvation, and her resurrection echoes biblical narratives. The cult that forms around her blood underscores the perils of blind faith and idolatry."

        "conclusion": "The novel presents an intriguing mix of fantasy and religious symbolism, with a plot centered around Dior’s unique abilities and the battle against vampires. While the story is engaging and raises thought-provoking themes, it leaves some questions unanswered and relies heavily on familiar savior tropes, which I find unoriginal.",

The protagonist, an ordinary girl, embarks on a journey with her vampire sister (from a cult that consumes other vampires) to uncover what must be done with Dior. They visit a vampire who ultimately commits suicide, leading to Dior being kidnapped by other vampires. Dior is forced to drink vampire blood three times, which should make her subservient, but she develops immunity. Additionally, those healed by her blood or who drink it are freed from their bonds. The main character’s vampire sister releases him, and he falls into a ravine but is rescued by a lioness (a shapeshifter introduced in the first part). They join forces with her clan to storm the vampires holding Dior, discovering that vampire strength is amplified by drinking Dior’s blood. It’s revealed that the vampires enslaved the lioness’s husband, whom she believed dead, but he is ultimately killed. A grand battle ensues, and Dior is killed, though it’s hinted she will resurrect like Jesus. The story also reveals that God sent vampires as punishment for humans killing His son (the first vampires were priests who murdered God’s son). This revelation shakes the characters’ faith. A cult begins to form around Dior’s healing blood, but unanswered questions remain, such as why her blood moved strangely in the tomb and its connection to the vampire they sought for guidance. The reviewer expresses frustration with the overused Jesus-like savior trope.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist evolves from an ordinary girl into a key figure in the battle against vampires. Dior’s immunity and healing abilities make her a central, almost messianic character. The lioness’s backstory adds depth, revealing her as a shapeshifter and her tragic connection to her enslaved husband. The vampire sister’s role in the cult and her actions drive parts of the plot.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story explores themes of faith, punishment, and redemption, with vampires serving as divine retribution for humanity’s sins. Dior’s blood symbolizes healing and salvation, while her resurrection parallels biblical narratives. The formation of a cult around her blood highlights the dangers of blind faith and idolatry.\n\n- **Unresolved Questions:**  \n  The reviewer notes lingering questions, such as the strange movement of Dior’s blood in the tomb and its connection to the vampire they sought. They also express dissatisfaction with the repetitive use of the Jesus-like savior trope.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents an intriguing mix of fantasy and religious symbolism, with a plot centered around Dior’s unique abilities and the battle against vampires. While the story is engaging and raises thought-provoking themes, it leaves some questions unanswered and relies heavily on familiar savior tropes, which the reviewer finds unoriginal.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Some tears were born from the profound sadness and despair the characters endured, while others flowed from the sheer sweetness of Gabe and Dior's blossoming relationship.",

The concept of days death, the vampire lore, and the religion he's created are just so unique to me. I've never read a book like it.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  This book picks up straight where the first left off (after a very helpful recap of the first book). It was jam-packed with action throughout, and every chapter left me wanting to read on.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I'm a super emotional person, but surprisingly, I don't actually cry often when reading. This book though... I ugly cried several times. One of which was on a packed plane to Kraków 🙃😆 Sometimes they were tears of utter sadness and despair for the characters that have gone through SO BLOODY MUCH! Other times, it was simply just how sweet Gabe and Dior's relationship has become 😭  \n\n- **Humor and Character Dynamics:**  \n  I didn't only sob though. I laughed a lot! I love Gabe's witty and sarcastic remarks, and the dynamic between him and the historian is so good.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The introduction of Celene's POV in this book was interesting. I didn't think I would enjoy that, but I did. And after thinking I didn't want Gabe to be with anyone lest it ruin his memory of Astrid... I found myself rooting for him and Phoebe. This relationship was left a bit vague at the end, and I hope to see more of this!!  \n\n- **Twists and Ending:**  \n  THE END THOUGH. Several twists. One I kinda saw coming, but it was still an OMG moment. I feel like the next book is gonna be sooooo good. I can't believe I'll have to wait so long for it 😭 guess I'll just have to have PATIENCE! 🖤  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book series is one of my faves, and the second installment did not disappoint. With its unique world-building, emotional depth, humor, and gripping twists, it left me eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

The pacing kept me engaged, and the cliffhanger ending left me eager for the next installment.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The introduction of the duskdancers, the unveiling of the full prophecy, and the deeper exploration of the four vampire courts and the history of the Redeemer and the One True Faith were highlights. The world felt rich and immersive, drawing me back into the saga despite the time gap since I read the first book.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Celene’s backstory was particularly compelling, and the relationships between characters were well-crafted. A touching moment was when Dior called Gabriel \"Papa\" after their reunion, which added emotional depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Continuity and Accessibility:**  \n  I was initially concerned about following the story after such a long break from the first book, but the dramatis personae was helpful, and I quickly re-immersed myself in the world.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book balances darkness with hope, as reflected in the opening quote about courage and perseverance. The tone is both brutal and uplifting, creating a compelling contrast.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sequel was a thrilling and emotionally resonant continuation of the series. It expanded the world, deepened the characters, and delivered a gripping climax that left me eagerly anticipating the next book. The blend of darkness and hope, along with the intricate storytelling, made it a standout read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "While I found some story beats predictable—likely due to my extensive experience with fantasy, action, and horror media—the ending initially caught me off guard. However, the final reveal diminished that surprise, leaving me ambivalent about it. The book felt a bit lengthy, but I understand the necessity of its 700+ pages. The vivid action scenes and detailed storytelling justified the length, and I appreciated the effort put into it.",
            "This installment offers much deeper characterization for Dior, portraying her as a fully realized person rather than a mere plot device. The introduction of a new point of view enhances the narrative, highlighting the necessity of Gabriel's humor to offset the darker, more somber tone.",
            "The world-building is rich and expansive, introducing new vampire villains and intriguing allies. The story is detailed, allowing each decision, thought, and action to resonate without feeling rushed. Nothing overstays its welcome, creating a satisfying narrative flow."

It seems JK took everyone’s advice and toned down the juvenile humor and weird misogyny that was rampant in the first book. This change might have been intentional to show the protagonist’s growth, and I’m pleased with it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Dior had a lot more characterization in this one and was treated like an actual person, not a weird MacGuffin-adjacent plot device. The new POV was also a great addition, emphasizing how much we need Gabriel’s humor to balance the grey and sad tone of the new perspective.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot:**  \n  The world was explored and explained more, with new vampire villains and interesting allies introduced. The story is lush and detailed, with each decision, thought, and action given time to marinate. I never felt like anything overstayed its welcome.  \n\n- **Predictability and Surprise:**  \n  I didn’t love how easily I was able to predict certain story beats, though I acknowledge this might be due to my extensive consumption of fantasy/action/horror media. The ending initially surprised me, but the final reveal somewhat undid that surprise, leaving me unsure of how I feel about it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book was a TIIIIINY bit long in the tooth, but I understand why it’s a 700+ page tome. The vivid action scenes and detailed storytelling required that length, and I appreciated the effort.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book and found it a significant improvement over the first. The character development, world-building, and detailed storytelling were highlights, even if some plot points felt predictable.

I tried to make it last, but Kristoff’s writing style compelled me to devour it in just a few days. The plot was a rollercoaster of twists and tension, which morbidly heightened my curiosity.  \n\n- **Comparison to the First Book:**  \n  I don’t think this installment of *Empire* is as good as the first one, though I still adored it. I was almost inclined to give it four serpentini (stars) because:  \n  1) The ending was very confusing—I couldn’t fully understand how certain events unfolded, and I’m unsure if this was intentional by the author or a lapse on my part.  \n  2) The “power of love” theme, which I can’t elaborate on without major spoilers.  \n  3) The villains in this book were significantly weaker compared to those in the previous installment. For instance, Lilidh didn’t live up to my expectations, the Terrors didn’t have as much impact as I thought they would, and Kiara started off strong but devolved into a petty, envious character.  \n\n- **Exceptional Villain:**  \n  One villain stood out and made me add an extra serpentino: Nikita Dyvok. Beyond his aesthetic, which fits perfectly into the type of characters I fangirl over, it was his demeanor, actions, and attitudes that made me adore him. He’s ruthless, driven by wrath and lust, power-hungry, and so corrupt that he’s called Cuornero.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Dior deserves praise for her significant improvement as a character. Jean-François is honestly a mood, and Gabriel… well, he’s Gabriel, and I love him.  \n\n- **Content Warning:**  \n  In true Kristoff fashion, there are VERY graphic, gory, and splatter-filled scenes that are hard to digest.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment didn’t quite match the brilliance of the first book, it was still an exhilarating read with standout characters like Nikita Dyvok and notable growth in others like Dior. The confusing ending and weaker villains were drawbacks, but the intense plot and Kristoff’s signature style kept me hooked.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 serpentini (stars)."

I’m so glad I didn’t give up on book 1 because this sequel was worth every second.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel has become one of my favorite characters of all time after this sequel.

However, there were a few words (Marquis, Chastain, Chevalier) that had differing pronunciations between the narrators, which was occasionally distracting.\n\n- **Artwork and Visual Elements:**  \n  The art, as always, was beautiful.

I appreciate the author's writing style, which strikes a perfect balance of engaging pretentiousness—enough to captivate without alienating.

I also appreciated Kiara; her character growth was beautiful, even though I still can't forgive her for what she did to Baptiste, my beloved.

I would have finished it sooner, but I never wanted it to end. No book will ever compare.  \n\n- **Favorite Aspect:**  \n  Dior was such a badass without ever lifting a sword, taking on and conquering a vast army. Aaron and Baptiste overcame the blood bond, and Gabriel stayed true to his word, moving heaven and earth and taking on a legion of the dead to return to his daughter. My heart was wrenched clean out when he mentioned burying his daughters, plural. I knew they would do this, but the ending made it okay. I had a feeling Celene and Gabriel were brewing a storm, and I’m beyond excited for the next book.  \n\n- **Least Favorite Aspect:**  \n  Leave my baby Aaron alone! Let him live in peace!  \n\n- **Favorite Characters:**  \n  I’m equally torn between Aaron and Phoebe—I’m so glad she made a comeback. They both deserve to see Daysdeath end. I also really enjoyed Kiara; her character growth was beautiful (though I still hate her for what she did to Baptiste, my baby boy).  \n\n- **Least Favorite Character:**  \n  You might think it’s Nikita, but I’m going out on a limb here to say the character I despised the most was Isla. Traitor—she deserved her death.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  HELL YES. Forever and always.  \n\n- **Hopes for the Next Book:**  \n  I genuinely have no hopes. I am at the mercy of Jay Kristoff.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left an indelible mark on me, with its unforgettable characters, emotional depth, and thrilling plot.

The plot had some excellent twists and turns, and certain parts of the story were incredibly thrilling, making the time spent in this series well worth it.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Damian Lynch’s narration was perfection—his sultry voice added a layer of brilliance to the audiobook. However, Shakira Shute’s narration, while alluring and boudoir-esque, felt out of place for this story. Her breathy, seductive tone didn’t align with the character she was voicing, and her whispering made it difficult to hear at times. It even put both myself and my husband to sleep, which was disappointing given the gore-filled, action-packed, vampyric nature of the tale. The story only briefly enters the realm of “Sexytime,” so her voice felt mismatched for the overall tone.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The book is massive, but the plot’s twists and turns kept me engaged.

He’s a damaged, broken man full of bitter rage, yet he has a way with words and a sword, and he’s reached a point where he has no fucks left to give.

            "I'm not sure if we're meant to like Celene, the morally ambiguous vampire, but she has become my favorite character. This story feels more fleshed out, introducing some incredible new characters. I particularly enjoyed the shift in narrative with the addition of Celene's perspective alongside Gabriel's. Kristoff skillfully adjusts his descriptions based on the character speaking, a technique that many authors struggle to master. For instance, when Celene describes Worm whisking into the boudoir and lifting a corpse—a young man missing both throat and privates—you can clearly see her voice. Gabriel would have definitely referred to it as 'cock' instead of 'privates.'",
            "The vivid gore of the battles will linger in my mind for some time, and I welcome it. Kristoff has proven himself a formidable contender for George R.R. Martin's title as the king of gory fantasy.",
            "I chose to read this book slowly to fully immerse myself, and it was genuinely hard to put it down, even after finishing. The best books are those that leave you with a lingering hangover, making it difficult to transition to another story, and this one certainly delivered that experience.",

I honestly did not know what to expect, as I remember loving the first book so much, and I wasn’t sure what direction the next one would take.\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  If anything, I think this story was better, more fleshed out, with some incredible new characters introduced. I also really enjoyed how the telling of this story changed with Celene's point of view being added to Gabriel's. Kristoff changed the way he described things depending on who was talking, which some authors can't, or don't do. For example, \"Worm whisked into the boudoir and lifted the first corpse she saw; a young man, missing both throat and privates.\" This is said by Celene, and you can really tell, as Gabe would definitely have said 'cock', not 'privates'.\n\n- **Character Likability and Impact:**  \n  I'm not sure if we are meant to like Celene, as she is a vampire who isn't necessarily good, but I thought she was great and has become my favourite character.\n\n- **Immersion and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I decided to slowly read this so as to fully immerse myself, and honestly, it was difficult to make my mind leave the book when not reading, especially when I finished it. The best kind of books are ones that leave you with a hangover where you struggle to move on to another book, and I really felt that here.\n\n- **Writing Style and Gore:**  \n  The gore in the battles will live in my head rent-free for a while, and I don’t mind. Kristoff has shown he is a serious contender for George R.R. Martin's crown of gory fantasy king.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe second installment of *The Empire of The Vampire* exceeded my expectations, delivering a richer plot, compelling new characters, and a narrative style that deepened my immersion. The emotional impact and vivid gore left a lasting impression, solidifying Jay Kristoff as a master of dark fantasy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This is thwarted by a jaded surrogate father who lost his biological daughter and chooses to save her, even at the cost of humanity’s potential cure.  \n\n- **Characters and Dialogue:**  \n  - The characters and dialogue are excellent, earning a 5/5 rating.  \n  - The majority of the main characters are female, except for the main male protagonist.  \n  - The story can get smutty at times, but it doesn’t detract from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  - A significant portion of the book (95%) is written in quotes or double quotes, as it uses a story-within-a-story format.  \n  - This style feels like breaking the fourth wall, as if the author is directly explaining the world-building to the audience. While it’s part of the plot, it feels like dumbing down the narrative, which is a personal pet peeve. Readers of a 700-page book are tenacious and capable of inferring details without such explicit explanations.  \n\n- **Artwork:**  \n  - The artwork is exceptional and perfectly captures the scenes and characters as I imagined them.  \n\n- **Character Design:**  \n  - A minor quibble is that almost every character who isn’t the main protagonist or their family is red-headed, and all the women have beauty marks that are repeatedly noted. This detail breaks the suspension of disbelief for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly engaging and unique story with well-developed characters and dialogue.

Just because a man survives long enough to grow a grey beard and wrinkles doesn’t mean he has truly lived. To live is to risk, to fear, and to fail. A man must dance on the dragon's teeth to steal fire from its tongue, knowing that most will be burned alive in the attempt. Yet, it is better to dance and fall than to never have danced at all. Pity not the man who dies too soon, but the one who lingers too long. Those who pass peacefully in their beds, slipping into sleep and waking nevermore... can they be said to have been awake at all?”* \n\nThis passage captures the essence of the book, emphasizing the importance of living fully and embracing risk, rather than merely existing."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Continuity and Accessibility:**  \n  I found this sequel easy to follow despite not having reread the first book, *Empire of the Vampire*, in over two years. The story seamlessly picked up where it left off, making it effortless to get back into the narrative.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I love how the story is framed, just like in the first book, with Gabriel recounting his tale to the historian. This structure adds depth and intrigue to the storytelling.\n\n- **Memorable Moments and Ending:**  \n  The book had some great moments, and I particularly loved the way it ended. It left me eager to continue the journey in the final installment.\n\n- **Action Scenes:**  \n  My only critique is that I found some of the fight scenes a bit boring, though this is more of a personal preference than a flaw in the writing.\n\n- **Quotes and Themes:**  \n  My favorite quote from the book encapsulates its themes beautifully:  \n  *“I’d rather die for something that matters than live for nothing at all. And because a man survived long enough to have a grey beard and wrinkles means not that he's actually lived. To live is to risk. To fear and to fail. A man must dance on the dragon's teeth to steal the fire from its tongue. Most are burned alive in the attempt. But better to dance and fall than to never have danced at all. Pity not the man who dies too soon, but the one who lingers too long. For those men who pass peaceful in their beds, who slip one night soft into sleep and wake nevermore ... can they be said to have been awake at all?”*\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a strong and engaging sequel that successfully built on the foundation of the first book. Despite a few less exciting fight scenes, the narrative structure, memorable moments, and thought-provoking themes made it a compelling read. I’m eagerly looking forward to the final book in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this sequel, Gabriel and Dior pick up right where the first book left off, navigating their complex relationship with Celene, the last Liathe, who proves to be an unreliable ally. As they grapple with their roles in the fight against the vampires, they encounter heartbreak and betrayal. The book gradually unveils the intricate theology and lore of its universe, building suspense throughout and culminating in a gripping finale.",
            "In this installment, Phoebe unexpectedly survives the events of the first book, emerging as both Gabe's rival and eventual love interest. While Clan Voss remains a significant presence, the story primarily unfolds in the territory of Clan Dyvok, who are portrayed as truly despicable and vicious antagonists. The shapeshifting dusk walkers of the highlands also play a crucial role, adding depth as morally ambiguous characters.",
            "This is the darkest and most unsettling book I've ever read—a massive, gothic tale that is both terrifying and grim. The storytelling is exceptional, and the prose is outstanding, rivaling that of Rothfuss. I find myself highlighting nearly as much of it."

It’s a huge, gothic, terrifying, grim-dark tale, delivered in fantastic fashion.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Gabriel and Dior start where book one left off, with Celene (the last Liathe) as an untrustworthy companion, as they try to understand their roles in saving mankind from the vampires. Heartbreak and betrayal await them. The theology and lore of the universe are slowly and suspensefully teased out as the book progresses, ending with great suspense.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Phoebe unexpectedly survived book one and has a large role as Gabe's rival and eventual lover. Clan Voss is always prominent, but this book is mainly spent in Clan Dyvok territory—they are truly disgusting, remarkably vicious, and great antagonists. The shapeshifting \"dusk walkers\" of the highlands play a significant role and are very nice \"gray\" characters.  \n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The POV is really creative. We are still in Castle Chastain with the vampire historian, but now he interviews both Gabe and Celene, giving us two unreliable narrators.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  Kristoff’s prose is excellent, as usual. I highlight nearly as much of his prose as I do Rothfuss's.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping, dark, and suspenseful continuation of the series, with complex characters, a richly developed world, and a creative narrative style.

Additionally, Jay threw in a wrench by including Celene’s POV, which added depth to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Violence and Intensity:**  \n  Jay upped the violence and spiciness in this installment.

Despite my initial expectations, the novel is nearly as good as the first and is highly recommendable.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Next Installment:**  \n  I’m looking forward to seeing how the story concludes in part three.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel didn’t meet my initial expectations, it delivered a compelling continuation of the story. It maintains the quality of the first book and sets the stage for an exciting conclusion in the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was one of the best books I read in 2023, alongside James Islington’s *The Will of the Many* and Pierce Brown’s *Light Bringer*. I eagerly awaited its release, even marking the date on my calendar, and read it in about three days after purchasing it on release day. I have no doubt it will be among my favorites of 2024.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The entire book is written in dialogue, a fascinating narrative device I’ve never seen effectively done before. It adds a unique layer to the storytelling, making it stand out.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is packed with action, romance, intrigue, and a couple of plot twists that left my head spinning. It’s reminiscent of *Blade* (the 1998 Wesley Snipes movie), with a half-human, half-vampire protagonist. However, this protagonist is French, has lost his battle, and is now recounting his downfall to his enemies while locked in a tower.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist is compelling and complex, with a tragic backstory that adds depth to the narrative. His journey and the way he relays his story to his captors are gripping.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmpire of the Damned is a phenomenal sequel that builds on the strengths of its predecessor, *Empire of the Vampire*.

There was so much action, with many twists and turns.\n- **Anticipation for the Next Installment:** I look forward to Book 3, though I hope it’s released sooner than three years.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI loved everything about this book! It was engaging, emotionally impactful, and packed with action and surprises. The only minor drawback was the limited number of illustrations in the advanced copy. Overall, it was a fantastic read, and I’m eagerly awaiting the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nFantastic! (Implied high praise, though no specific numerical rating is mentioned.)"

            "*Empire of the Damned* picks up right where the previous book left off, complete with a helpful recap for those of us with less-than-stellar memories. The plot is gripping, and true to form, the main characters are enduring some truly harrowing experiences. After the events of the first book, I thought my heart couldn't take any more, but I was wrong!\n\nThe story is filled with shocking twists and revelations that kept me torn between the urge to devour every page and the desire to savor the experience. The final section was so intense that I found myself pacing my living room like a madman—at least I racked up about 5,000 steps in the process!",
            "This story introduces a captivating mix of new and familiar characters, enhanced by the addition of a second narrator. I appreciate how this new perspective broadens the world and contrasts with Gabriel’s viewpoint, adding depth and drama that keeps you questioning everything. Additionally, the evolution of Gabriel and Jean Francois’ relationship is delightful; their witty banter and flirtation often had me laughing, providing a welcome break from the plot's intensity.",
            "The world-building in this book is exceptional! It delves deeply into the history, politics, and creatures of Elidaen, leaving readers with even more questions. We encounter new vampires, including the fearsome Princes of Forever, who are in pursuit of Dior. Much of the story unfolds in the court of Blood Dyvok, where the intricate dynamics are captivating. I particularly enjoyed exploring the politics within and between vampire courts—they are as opulent, seductive, and bloody as one would expect!",
            "Beneath the bloodshed, heartbreak, and cruelty lies a persistent theme of love and faith, accompanied by a glimmer of hope that these virtues will ultimately triumph over the evil that afflicts the world.",
            "This book will likely break your heart, but you'll cherish every moment! I even created a special tab for the spots where my tears have probably stained the pages.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  I was not prepared for what a MASTERPIECE this book was going to be! There wasn’t a single aspect of this book that didn’t completely exceed all expectations.  \n\n- **Author’s Signature Style:**  \n  There’s everything you would expect from a Jay Kristoff book—epic battles, scenes that will make you stain the book with your tears, witty banter, a bit of blood smut, and of course, a colorful but creative use of profanity and more!  \n\n- **Continuity and Recap:**  \n  *Empire of the Damned* starts where the last book left off, and there’s even a recap at the beginning for people like me with the memory equivalent to a bucket with a hole in the base.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  We are introduced to several amazing new and not-so-new characters, along with a second narrator. I love the addition of the second narrator—it expanded the world so much, and the way their point of view contrasts with Gabriel’s adds so much drama and makes you question everything!  \n  I also loved the progression of Gabriel and Jean Francois’ relationship. The banter and flirting between them often had me cackling, and it gave occasional respite from the intensity of the plot.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building in this book was really something else! We learn so much about the history, politics, and creatures of Elidaen, yet there are so many more questions created.  \n  We are also introduced to new vampires, including more terrifying Princes of Forever in pursuit of Dior. The main part of this tale takes place in the court of Blood Dyvok, and the dynamics of the Dyvok are intriguing. I loved learning more about the politics between and within vampire courts—they are as opulent, seductive, and bloody as you would imagine!  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot in this book is intense, and, in true Kristoff fashion, none of our main characters are having a particularly good time. After everything that happened in book one, I didn’t know how my heart could possibly be crushed any further, but it happened!  \n  There were some unbelievable plot twists and revelations, and I was torn between not wanting to put this book down and wanting to savor every page. The last part of the book was so intense that I was reading it while pacing my living room like a lunatic (I got about 5000 steps in, though!).  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  Under all the blood, heartbreak, and cruelty, there is a constant theme of love and faith, and the glimmer of hope that these things will prevail over the evil plaguing the world.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book will probably crush your soul, but you’ll love every second! I had to have a special tab just for places where my tears are probably staining the page.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Empire of the Damned* was an absolutely phenomenal sequel. It exceeded all expectations with its intense plot, rich world-building, and emotional depth. I’m so excited for it to be released so I can obsess over it some more!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It maintains a fast pace, with plenty of intense and gory moments that feel integral to the dark world rather than gratuitous.  \n\n- **World-Building and Tone:**  \n  The book continues to immerse readers in a grim, vampire-ruled world filled with brutal imagery, such as children stripped of their faces and bodies hung as decorations. While darker and more depressing than its predecessor, it balances this with lighter moments and humor that carry over from the first book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  Gabriel, Dior, and Celene (revealed to be Gabriel’s sister) form the core group, embarking on a quest for answers. Their journey is fraught with danger, including encounters with Fabien Voss’ children and the ferocious Dyvok vampires. The characters face significant challenges, such as Gabriel falling from a bridge, Celene being overpowered, and Dior’s capture, which adds tension and urgency to the plot.  \n\n- **Comparison to the First Book:**  \n  While still highly enjoyable, this installment feels like a middle book in a trilogy and doesn’t quite match the standalone brilliance of the first. However, it successfully builds on the foundation laid by its predecessor, deepening the story and setting the stage for the final installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEmpire of the Damned is a gripping, dark, and action-packed sequel that expands on the world and characters introduced in the first book. Though slightly less impactful as a standalone read, it delivers a compelling narrative with a perfect blend of gore, humor, and emotional depth. Fans of the series will be eagerly anticipating the final installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFive stars."

While this book is still quite hefty, the action flows more smoothly, making it a more engaging read.  \n\n- **Sex Scenes:**  \n  The numerous sex scenes felt tedious to me, and I ended up skimming through them. I acknowledge that they might be well-written, but after years of reading romance, I’ve reached a point where I prefer focusing on the plot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel continues to be a compelling character as he recounts his story to the vampire interviewer. The introduction of his vampire sister, Celene, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. Her presence and the revelation of her captivity in the deepest caverns were unexpected and fascinating.  \n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  The author excels at delivering surprising twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. These moments kept me thoroughly engaged, and I found myself tipping my hat to the author multiple times throughout the book.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you were on the fence after the first book, I’d encourage you to give this one a chance. It’s a significant improvement and worth the read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a marked improvement over its predecessor, with better pacing, compelling character development, and unexpected plot twists.

Their journey is filled with relentless peril, leaving the heroes with little respite, which makes for a heart-wrenching read. Yet, amidst the despair, there are satisfying moments that offer a glimmer of hope.",

It’s a dark and hopeless world for mortals, and the story conveys the high stakes effectively. While the darkness felt necessary, it was also heavy and emotionally taxing, especially around the 240-page mark, where I had to take a break with happier books.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Gabe and Dior face immense challenges in their quest to save the world. Their journey is fraught with constant dire situations, and the good guys rarely catch a break, which made it heart-wrenching to read. However, there were satisfying moments that preserved a glimmer of hope amidst the doom and gloom.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story takes unpredictable directions, constantly keeping the reader on edge. The dual narrative adds a fresh and engaging layer to the storytelling. While the pacing was intense and relentless, it contributed to the overall sense of urgency and stakes.\n\n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  This is more horror than fantasy, and readers should be prepared for an ugly, brutal world. It’s a strong continuation from the first book but not for the faint of heart. The payoff for enduring this dark journey will hopefully make the third book even sweeter.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heavy, emotionally intense read that effectively conveys a dark and hopeless world. While the relentless doom and gloom were challenging, the unpredictable plot, dual narrative, and moments of hope kept me engaged. It’s a strong continuation of the series, but readers should brace themselves for its brutal, horror-driven tone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They looked like full-color illustrations with a standard iPhone black-and-white filter thrown on top, which erased a lot of details and depth.\n\n- **Overall Reading Experience:**  \n  Despite the issues, this is the first book in a while that I physically could not put down.

I appreciated the parallels and lore it shares with *Interview with the Vampire* (2022 TV show), even with the differing plots. The unexpected twist of Phoebe being the lion from the previous book was both surprising and fitting. Additionally, the introduction of the Dyvok and Dusk dancers brought an extra layer of excitement, especially during Gabe’s fight scenes.",

Celene is a complex character; her lies, secrets, and unwarranted animosity toward Gabe can be frustrating. Phoebe adds depth to the story, bringing sexual tension and a complicated backstory with Gabe. The dynamic between Dyvok’s savage energy and Voss’s cold demeanor is striking, while Nakita serves as a truly terrifying villain. Meanwhile, Aaron and Batist’s love story serves as the emotional core of the narrative, with their ongoing relevance being a standout feature.",

The dynamic relationships, unexpected twists, and intense action scenes make it a standout read. While some characters, like Celene, evoke frustration, others, like Dior and Aaron/Batist, add depth and heart to the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n~4.5 stars~"

It lived up to my expectations and delivered an emotional, shocking, and beautifully written story. It’s a very good book, and I won’t be disappointed by it.  \n\n- **Continuity and Concept:**  \n  The book picks up where the last one left off, maintaining the same concept of Gabe retelling his story. It’s consistent with the style of the Empire series.  \n\n- **Characterization and Writing Style:**  \n  Gabriel’s character is exceptionally well-written. His banter with Jean-François, interactions with Dior, and his musings and emotions are some of the best writing out there. I could read it all day.  \n\n- **POV Shift and Secondary Character Development:**  \n  The introduction of a second POV was initially jarring. I didn’t care much for the character at first, and their interactions felt more normal and serious, which made them seem boring compared to Gabriel’s POV. However, it improved as the book progressed, and I grew to care for the characters a bit more, though it never matched the depth of Gabriel’s perspective.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Plot Development:**  \n  The book delivered many tears, shocking reveals, emotional moments, beautiful prose, and brilliant banter. It’s exactly what I expected from an Empire book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Retelling Style:**  \n  At certain points, I felt a little tired of the retelling style. Knowing that things are dire in the “now” made me anxious for the story to move forward. However, the absolutely EPIC finale more than made up for it.  \n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  I highly recommend getting the full-color edition when it’s available. The beautiful illustrations add a lot to the immersion.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Next Book:**  \n  I can’t wait for the next book in the series!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fantastic continuation of the series, delivering emotional depth, shocking twists, and brilliant writing.

They were humanized to the point that I felt I belonged and could connect deeply with their desires and motives. However, in this book, I didn’t feel that same connection. The focus on the vampire aspect and the repetitive fatal situations for the same characters, like Gabriel always being disbanded, made me miss the togetherness and human imperfections from the first book.\n\n- **Narrative and Pacing:**  \n  As a narrator, I prefer Gabriel. The chapters told by another character felt like a nightmare to finish because nothing significant happened, and there was little development.

            "I'm starting to feel fatigued by the story's retelling. At one point, I expected Jean-Francois to be killed off, leading the narrative to shift to the present, but that didn't happen. With much of the backstory already revealed through Gabriel's narration to the Historian, some moments—especially the ending—felt predictable, diminishing the element of surprise. From page 693 to the end, I found Jay's direction for the story rather silly, reminiscent of a B-movie horror flick where the monster keeps returning for more. However, the pacing was excellent, the action was engaging, and despite its 713 pages, the book remained entertaining.",
            "Celene: I absolutely loved her! I felt a deep sympathy for her character, even as her secrets were revealed. She remains one of my favorites. \n\nPhoebe: The definition of a badass, period. \n\nKiara: I actually liked her, despite her villainous nature. I was eager to see her character develop, but I was disappointed with the outcome. \n\nReyne: I really enjoyed her! I loved her as Worm and appreciated her contributions to the story. \n\nKiara: I would have preferred if she had been kicked out of the building, leaving her fate unresolved. \n\nConnor: I was excited about the way the story unfolded, but I rolled my eyes at the dramatic exit. I would have preferred to see that tangled web play out in the next installment; it felt overly dramatic for my taste. \n\nDior: The ending with Dior didn’t resonate with me. While I understand the author’s reasoning, it felt odd for Gabriel to come down to Celene’s cell. Given Jean-Francois's visible distress from Gabriel’s earlier attack, this choice seemed misplaced.",

The resolution left me questioning the effectiveness of those fighting for change. The struggles depicted throughout the book painted a grim picture for those seeking a better world. I'm uncertain whether the ending will offer a happy resolution or a liberating movement, as I doubt the good characters can achieve it.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Introduction and Recap:**  \n  I loved how the book began, plus with the addition of Jay Kristoff adding a little recap/refresher of characters in the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Celene: I loved her so much! I sympathized with her character, even with learning her secrets. She continues to be a favored character of mine.  \n  - Phoebe: Definition of badass, period.  \n  - Kiara: I actually really liked her. Yes, she was villainous, but I was interested in seeing her have some sort of character arc. I was not happy with what occurred.  \n  - Reyne: I really enjoyed her! I loved her initially as Worm and really loved her contribution to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot Elements:**  \n  - I loved the Dusk Dancers and thought that addition to the story was so much fun.  \n  - Overall, the pacing was awesome, the action was on point, and for a 713-page book, it was entertaining.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Predictability:**  \n  I am becoming slightly tired of hearing the story as a retelling. I thought at one point that they were going to kill Jean-Francois and the story would begin in the current time, but that obviously didn’t happen. With everything having already happened and Gabriel filling in the Historian, I feel this took away from some moments (especially the ending), making some things predictable or expectant, which removed the surprise factor.  \n\n- **Character Choices and Logic:**  \n  Even though I could reason with why Jay did this in the book, I still found it a very odd choice to have Gabriel come down to Celene’s cell. Regardless of Gabriel being a prisoner, Jean-Francois was visibly shaken from Gabriel’s previous attack, so I don’t think that made a ton of sense. It stood out as a bit misplaced for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone in the Final Chapters:**  \n  From page 693 to the end of the book, I did not like the way Jay decided to steer the story. I found it to be quite silly. In my head, it played out like a B-film horror movie, with the monster or boogeyman who just never dies and comes back a fourth time to kill off someone.  \n\n- **Fight Scenes and Power Dynamics:**  \n  The fight scene between Gabe and Nikita was a bit underwhelming. Especially with the particular blood running in his system, he still couldn’t quite take Nikita without help. I was waiting to see him show some incredible strength, but he kind of wasted the blood powers in my opinion. Same with the Terrors.  \n\n- **Character Exits and Resolutions:**  \n  - Kiara: I would have rather her been kicked out of the building and what happened to her left unanswered.  \n  - Connor: I was so excited with this dropping the way it did, but then I just kind of rolled my eyes at the dramatic exit. I personally would have loved that tangled web to play out in the next installment. It felt very OTT dramatics for my personal taste.  \n  - Dior: The ending with Dior didn’t really do anything for me.  \n\n- **Overall Ending and Themes:**  \n  The low points for me in those final chapters were simply a case of \"OTT Dramatics.\" I felt it made it all a bit silly personally. Also, how things ended, I’m just not sure if I am a believer in what difference those that are fighting can really do. The struggles and outcomes during this book really painted a difficult picture for those fighting for a better world. I’m not quite convinced right now that if the ending is going to be a HEA or a sort of freeing movement, the \"good\" characters can actually pull it off. However, if the end game of this series is to be a bleak ending, then I think that is something that will be absolutely believable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Damned* started strong and had many elements I enjoyed—such as compelling characters, great pacing, and fun world-building—the final chapters fell flat for me. The narrative choices, particularly the over-the-top dramatics and predictable elements, detracted from my overall enjoyment. I’m left uncertain about the direction of the series and whether the characters can achieve a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Although the book is dense and took some time to read, it was both entertaining and intense, particularly in the last 100 pages that kept me on the edge of my seat. The final 20 pages were especially poignant, moving me to tears. I appreciated the refresher at the beginning and hope for a similar approach in the next installment.",
            "The author skillfully crafts strong, distinct characters that leave a lasting impression. With a diverse cast, some characters are instantly lovable, while others evoke strong dislike, and some grow on you over time. This character development is one of the book's standout features.",
            "The book's dark themes effectively capture its grimdark and horror fantasy elements.

However, some moments felt excessively \"edge-lordy,\" which occasionally disrupted the narrative and made certain scenes awkward or uncomfortable.",

While the book is dense and took me a while to get through, it was highly entertaining and stressful, especially the last 100 pages, which kept me on the edge of my seat. The final 20 pages were emotionally impactful, bringing me to tears. I appreciated the refresher Kristoff included at the beginning and hope he does the same for the next installment.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is very dark, which aligns with its grimdark and horror fantasy elements. While I don’t have much experience with these genres, I found the darkness compelling, though it required me to take my time with the story. However, some moments felt overly “edge-lordy,” which occasionally took me out of the narrative and made certain scenes feel awkward or uncomfortable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Kristoff excels at writing strong, distinct characters with a powerful presence on the page. The characters are varied—some you love, some you hate, and others you grow to appreciate (or dislike) over time. Their development is one of the book’s strongest aspects.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  I enjoyed the storytelling approach, which feels like someone recounting a tale, complete with quips that remind you of the narrator’s presence. This style adds a unique layer to the narrative.\n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  The novel delves deeper into the world’s history and lore while leaving room for future exploration. We get to see more of the world and its rich backstory, which kept me engaged and curious about what’s to come.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a gripping and emotionally charged read, though its density and occasional over-the-top edginess slightly detracted from the experience. Despite these minor flaws, the strong characters, immersive world-building, and compelling narrative style make it a worthwhile continuation of the series.

            "Gabriel's complete disregard for reason when his 17-year-old adopted daughter, Dior, cries is frustrating. While his protective instincts are understandable, they often come off as irrational and detract from the story. Their dynamic resembles that of Geralt and Ciri from *The Witcher*, but Dior's quirky, uneducated, and overly sarcastic personality lacks the depth that makes the original relationship compelling. Ultimately, Gabriel's overprotectiveness feels more like a crutch than a genuine connection, which diminishes the overall impact of their interactions.",

The dual timelines and dual POVs are skillfully interwoven, creating a perfect narrative structure.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabriel remains a charismatic, complex, and multifaceted character, full of shadows yet also love, hope, and a strong sense of family. However, the introduction of some characters from Gabriel's past felt abrupt and contrived, serving as a convenient solution to unresolved situations. The antagonists, except for the chilling Niklita, were dealt with too easily in the final pages.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Kristoff's writing is both brilliant and heavy, blending dark, disturbing, and violent elements with moments of humor, sarcasm, and memorable exchanges. The book demands close attention, rewarding readers with intricate details and clues that make for a stimulating reading experience.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is emotionally intense, often painful and disturbing, with moments that made me want to give up. It’s a relentless narrative with little joy, and even when it appears, it’s quickly stripped away. Despite this, the emotional depth and complexity kept me engaged.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is devastating and leaves many questions unanswered, creating a strong desire for the third and final book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I’m not a die-hard fan of Kristoff and found some flaws in the book, I consider this second installment a small masterpiece. It’s a heavy, dark, and violent read, but its intricate plot, compelling characters, and masterful storytelling make it a standout. Despite some minor issues, I thoroughly enjoyed it and can’t wait for the final book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "*Empire of the Damned* significantly improves upon its predecessor, *Empire of the Vampire*, particularly in its narrative structure. The removal of the split timeline, which I found distracting in the first book, is a welcome change. Instead, the story alternates between the perspectives of the Castia siblings, Gabriel and Celene. Celene’s viewpoint is especially refreshing, as her unique position allows her to share private moments and insights that Gabriel cannot witness. This approach keeps the narrative cohesive and engaging, enhancing the flow of action. Despite its length of over 700 pages, *Empire of the Damned* maintains a lightning-fast pace. The author skillfully balances deep character and world development with relentless action, ensuring the story never feels sluggish—a remarkable achievement for a middle book in a trilogy. I was hooked from start to finish.",

The female narrator mispronounced \"Lilidh\" as \"Lily\" or \"Lileed,\" and struggled with French terms like \"famille,\" rendering it as \"fameel.\"  \n  - The male narrator’s performance, while not perfect, added to the jarring experience of the narrator changeover.  \n\n- **Endings and Themes:**  \n  - The author’s belief in not having \"happy endings\" is evident in the story’s tone and events.  \n  - I’d accept a positive ending, even if not happy (e.g., heroic sacrifice), but I’d be disappointed if none of the characters achieve this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivered a powerful emotional impact, with a well-developed core cast and an expanded narrative scope.

I don’t consider these books “good” in the literary sense, but they are my biggest guilty pleasure. I love the world and the often page-turning pace of everything.  \n\n- **Criticism of Gratuitous Content:**  \n  The gratuitous nature of the author’s writing is starting to get out of hand. The book opens with a vampire threesome, and the graphic nature of the gore and sex (sometimes combined) is significantly amplified in this installment. If you’re unsure about the series due to its graphic content, this book will likely push your limits.  \n\n- **Character Critique:**  \n  Nikita Dyvok is an over-the-top sadist who doesn’t work as well as Fabien. Fabien appeared in only 10 pages of the last book, but those remain the best 10 pages of the entire series to date. His mere presence and the atmosphere he creates are enough to instill fear.  \n  Celine still falls short as a character, though she gets more development here. Having her point of view doesn’t fully work because no one wants to hear her side of the story.  \n\n- **Strengths of the Book:**  \n  Most of what Kristoff did well in Book 1 still works here. He has a gift for creating fun supporting characters. I loved exploring more of this world, particularly how Ossway is inspired by the culture and history of the British Isles. The climax of this book is much stronger than Book 1’s, which felt like a cut-and-paste of *The Last of Us*. This finale had good buildup from both this book and the previous one.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Next Installment:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I look forward to the next book in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book has significant flaws, particularly in its gratuitous content and some character shortcomings, it retains the elements that make the series enjoyable, such as its engaging world-building, strong supporting characters, and a well-executed climax.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25/5"

The introduction of both new and returning characters, along with Gabe’s distinctive storytelling style, was a highlight. However, the plot felt overly drawn out due to repetitive elements like violence, battles, and spice, which made it less concise than it could have been. The author often indulged in excessive details and fantasies that seemed unnecessary. While the clever foreshadowing of certain aspects of the ending was effective, I found that some surprises at the conclusion were enjoyable, even if I didn’t fully grasp all of them.",

We follow Gabe as he recounts further events to Jean-Francois, which I enjoyed. The story introduces both new and returning characters, and Gabe’s unique storytelling style remains a highlight.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While there were some surprises and twists, the plot felt overly drawn out due to repetitive elements like violence, battles, and spice. The story could have been tighter and more concise. The author often delved into excessive details and fantasies that, in my opinion, weren’t necessary.  \n\n- **Character Development and Revelations:**  \n  I really liked the explanations and revelations about Gabe’s past and the backgrounds of other characters. These moments added depth and were well-executed.  \n\n- **POV Shift and Tone:**  \n  The unexpected POV shift was intriguing at first but ultimately too graphic and violent for my taste. I don’t typically read such content, and this reminded me why.  \n\n- **Ending and Surprises:**  \n  The fact that we already knew certain aspects of the ending from the beginning was cleverly done. However, there were still surprises at the end, most of which I enjoyed, even if I didn’t fully understand everything.  \n\n- **Comparison to Book One:**  \n  Overall, I found the first book to be significantly better. While this installment had its moments, it didn’t quite live up to my expectations.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Next Book:**  \n  I’m very curious to see how the author will conclude the story in the third book and look forward to finding out what happens next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its strengths, particularly in character revelations and maintaining continuity with the first book. However, the excessive violence, repetitive elements, and drawn-out pacing detracted from my enjoyment.

I really feel for him, which is part of why reading this series is so miserable sometimes, because he is so miserable. I just want the guy to be happy for like, five minutes.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Twists:**  \n  The plot is well choreographed. I think I understand something, and then I realize I don’t. But it doesn’t feel unearned. It feels like the seeds were planted and I just missed them. Seriously next-level plot twists and turns.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The depth and complexity of this world are incredible. It’s so hateful and awful, I can believe it. It’s like you’re truly there. And you don’t want to be.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Tone:**  \n  It was hard to get through this. Harder some days than others. Sometimes you just want one sliver of victory, a single cathartic moment for some light to crack through. And it just … never comes. Everything is taken away. Every victory is outshined or squandered. You just cannot win. That’s really hard on my mental health to read day after day. If there had been just one single high in opposition to the constant low, I think it would have been a five-star read easily.  \n\n- **Spoiler-Specific Critiques:**  \n  Nikita should have died like a loser. I hate that he died in a cool battle moment. The Heartless should have suffered more. I can’t believe she got the last laugh. Connor’s reveal followed immediately by his death was just an unfair twisting of the knife and read as totally unnecessary. Isla should have suffered more. I’m glad she died, but it wasn’t enough. Even the climactic high of this book was so depressing.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement and Motivation to Continue:**  \n  I read several other books in the course of reading this one just to have a break. I’m only reading the next one because of that little tease with Joaquin at the end. If that doesn’t pan out into something positive, I’m going to feel like this whole series was a waste.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is excellently written with strong character development, intricate plotting, and immersive world-building, its unrelenting bleakness and lack of cathartic moments made it emotionally draining and difficult to read. Despite its merits, I wouldn’t read it again, though I’m tentatively continuing the series due to a promising tease at the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly stated, but implied to be less than five stars due to the emotional toll and lack of balance in tone."

They do not enhance the plot or character development and come across as purely titillating. As an asexual reader, I found them jarring and uncomfortable, especially compared to Tolkien’s more subtle approach to romance and intimacy. However, the characters are well-crafted and deeply engaging. I genuinely cared about them, particularly Gabriel as a father figure.

They don’t contribute to the plot or character development and feel purely titillating. As an asexual reader, I find them jarring and uncomfortable, especially given my preference for Tolkien’s approach to romance and intimacy.\n\n- **Representation of LGBTQIA2S+ Relationships:**  \n  I appreciate the matter-of-fact way the authors handle LGBTQIA2S+ relationships. The romance feels genuine and not like a novelty or gimmick, which is a refreshing and progressive approach. However, I noticed the absence of asexual representation in the series.\n\n- **Vampiric Relationships:**  \n  The dynamics of vampire relationships, particularly the one between the female vampire and the head of the Dyvok clan, are unsettling. The incestuous and age-inappropriate undertones, with terms like “father” and “daughter” used between them, make these interactions uncomfortable despite the authors’ intent.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is a blend of horror, high fantasy, post-apocalyptic, and grimdark elements. It’s a dark, unrelenting world with vivid imagery reminiscent of historical atrocities like WW2 concentration camps, the Cambodian killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide. The tone is intense and often horrific, more so than the first book.\n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  The story is packed with near non-stop action, creating an emotional roller coaster. The battle scenes, like the one between the Heartless and the Grail, are particularly gripping and emotionally charged.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is incredible, especially the origin of vampires. The detailed and immersive setting is one of the book’s strongest aspects.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-crafted and deeply engaging. I found myself genuinely caring about them, particularly Gabriel as a father figure. His hopes and sorrows feel authentic, and the anti-hero tropes surrounding him are compelling.\n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  Kristoff’s dialogue is witty, quotable, and often humorous, though it can lean a bit sophomoric at times.\n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  The book is filled with plot twists, perhaps even too many, which keeps the story unpredictable but occasionally overwhelming.\n\n- **Cliffhanger Ending:**  \n  The cliffhanger ending has left me eagerly anticipating the next book, though I regret starting the series before all the books are published.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my discomfort with the graphic sex scenes and the unsettling nature of some vampire relationships, this book is a gripping and emotionally charged read. Its incredible world-building, well-developed characters, and relentless pacing make it a standout in the genre. While it’s not without its flaws, it’s a highly engaging and memorable addition to the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (would have been 5 stars if not for the sex scenes)."

Typically, Kristoff’s books have so much going on that I don’t notice the characters being moved toward the big battle, but in this one, I really had to focus during the middle section. I think the book could have been shorter without losing the story.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  If you’re going to have main characters tell the story to a scribe or minstrel, this is the way to do it. I appreciated this approach, especially compared to another fantasy series where a supposed legendary fighter spends 260 hours navel-gazing.\n\n- **Character Development and Tension:**  \n  Kristoff remains an author who does not pull punches. Every single character is in danger, and nothing is ever certain. This kept me invested despite the pacing issues.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Reflection:**  \n  I still enjoyed the book, but I wonder if my brain wasn’t in the right place for it.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Language and Authenticity:**  \n  I found the language in the book to be a little inconsistent for the time period it was set in, which took me out of the story at times.\n\n- **Character Engagement and Tone:**  \n  For too much of the book, the characters didn’t seem to take the situations they were in particularly seriously, which made it hard for me to fully engage with the story initially.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  Up until the 25% mark, I considered putting the book on hold or even not finishing it. However, the last third of the book is where it truly shines. The stakes finally feel heightened, and each chapter delivers bombshell after bombshell, making it incredibly gripping.\n\n- **Twists and Resolutions:**  \n  Without giving away spoilers, I noticed that quite a few twists were quickly undercut, which slightly diminished their impact.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  It took me a little over a month to read the book (possibly longer), but I devoured the last 300 pages in a day and a half. The ending left me eagerly anticipating the next installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some inconsistencies in language and character tone, and a slow start, the final third of the story was exceptionally compelling, with high stakes and thrilling revelations. Despite a few undercut twists, the overall experience was enjoyable, and I’m excited for the next book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4ish stars out of 5!"

            "The action is relentless, particularly in the final 100 pages, filled with intense and vivid fight scenes. The pacing keeps the story engaging, with twists and revelations that sustain momentum. Central to the plot is the Grail's power to end the Daysdeath and restore the sun’s glory, as Dior seeks guidance on harnessing her abilities. Tension arises from the conflicts between the powerful vampire factions, Blood Voss and Blood Dyvok, over Dior’s significance. The epilogue skillfully hints at deeper truths about the Grail, leaving me eager for the next installment.",
            "Gabriel, the silversaint, is a complex character who isn't always likable, particularly when he slaps Dior under his sister Celene's influence. The sibling relationship between Gabriel and Celene (now Liathe) is a captivating mix of love and hate, further enriched by their father's backstory. Dior's tragic legacy adds depth to her compelling journey. Supporting characters like Nikita and Lilidh are both alluring and villainous, enhancing the narrative. However, I would have liked to see more focus on Phoebe, the fierce mountain lioness, and her dynamic with Gabriel, as they form a powerful couple.",
            "The book is dark and gory, featuring vivid depictions of vampiric rule, especially the decadent sadism of the Dyvok. This establishes a gritty, immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's themes.",
            "The worldbuilding deepens as we explore the realms of shifters and skinchangers, introducing a captivating dynamic to the supernatural ensemble. The emergence of a secret society of vampires, dedicated to seeking the Grail for redemption, further enriches the lore. Drawing heavily from Christian theology, particularly the betrayal of Judas, the mythology adds an intriguing layer of mystery and provokes thought about the nature of religion and an indifferent God."

        "conclusion": "This book builds on the foundations of the first, delivering a rich, dark, and action-packed narrative. The expanded worldbuilding, complex characters, and relentless action make it a compelling read.

            "The novel felt overly long for the story it aimed to tell, often meandering as Gabriel and Dior wandered, encountered various characters, and fought vampires. At times, it seemed the author lost focus on the main plot, introducing previously unmentioned characters from Gabriel’s past, which created some plot holes. Nevertheless, the story remained engaging, even when it strayed from logic. The ending was a pleasant surprise, providing a satisfying conclusion. While the book has its flaws, it still offers enjoyment. If you liked the first book, you’ll likely appreciate this sequel; however, if you struggled with the first, this installment probably won’t change your perspective.",
            "The father-daughter dynamic between Gabriel and Dior was the standout aspect of the book. I also appreciated the introduction of a new POV character, whom I found more engaging than Gabriel. The interactions between Aaron and Baptiste added depth, and I was pleasantly surprised by my fondness for a new female character. Additionally, the unresolved sexual tension between Gabriel and Jean-Francoise was a recurring theme I enjoyed, even if I suspect it won't be fully explored.",

The prose is engaging, and the secrets and prophecies are well-developed and coming to fruition. However, the reliance on \"perfect saves\" and last-minute rescues can feel contrived, detracting from the subtlety and realism of the plot.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character arcs are beautifully executed. Dior grows into her role as a savior, Gabriel discovers a purpose beyond vengeance, and even the vampires have rich backstories and motivations. Each character is distinct, strong, and determined, with unique personalities and survival instincts. Dior’s youthful determination, Gabriel’s bravery and humor, Phoebe’s loyalty and protectiveness, and Celene’s enigmatic and hardened nature all stand out.\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  The lore and history of the world are vast and intricate, weaving together culture, identity, faith, and emotion. The Highlanders’ pagan origins, the prophecy of Dior, and Celene’s vampire origins add depth and complexity to the story. The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid scenery and a dark, grotesque tone that enhances the horror elements.\n\n- **Horror and Gore:**  \n  The book is brutally dark, with terrifying and grotesque imagery, especially during Dior’s time with the Dyvok vampires. The atrocities committed by the Dyvok and the general gore contribute to the story’s horror, though it can feel overwhelming at times.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Twists:**  \n  The back-and-forth between Gabriel’s and Celene’s perspectives provides a dual narrative that enriches the story. However, the final reveal is shocking and potentially disruptive to character dynamics, leaving the reader both intrigued and frustrated.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The emotional stakes are high, with characters facing immense challenges and personal growth. The relationships between the main characters, their friends, and foes are compelling and add depth to the story.

I could understand their motives and actions, even when they were at odds with each other.  \n  - Phoebe and Gabe’s story was particularly moving, with their brokenness and connection resonating deeply.  \n  - Dior’s strength, resolve, and empathy were inspiring to read, even though her journey was heartbreaking.  \n  - The sibling rivalry and dynamics within the Dyvok, Voss, and Chastain families added layers to the characters and their relationships.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing was incredible, with emotional depth and vivid descriptions that brought the story to life.  \n  - The emotional whiplash was intense, leading to an ugly cry at the end, which speaks to the power of the storytelling.  \n\n- **Criticism:**  \n  - At times, the introduction of new information felt overwhelming, especially towards the end, requiring me to go back and reread sections to fully grasp the details.  \n  - This might be due to the complexity of the series, which is more advanced than other books I’ve read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an incredible sequel that surpassed my expectations. The world-building, plot, and character development were all masterfully executed, leaving me emotionally invested and eager for more. Despite some minor challenges with the complexity of the lore, I loved every moment of this book and could talk about it for hours.

            "This over 700-page book presents a compelling story, though it occasionally drags in certain sections. Some moments feel repetitive, featuring near-successful attempts followed by well-timed setbacks that could have been condensed or omitted. The narrative is split, primarily focusing on Gabriel de Leon, with his captor, Jean-Francois, offering additional context. The plot centers on Gabriel and his sister, Liathe, as they strive to protect Dior, the Holy Grail, while searching for a way to end the endless night without sacrificing Dior’s life.",
            "The narrators are morally ambiguous, unreliable, and somewhat unlikable; however, Kristoff's characters, despite their flaws, continue to be endearing.",
            "The author's writing is purposeful, vibrant, and self-aware, enriched with charming metaphors. He skillfully builds a world through storytelling, revealing insights gradually and deliberately. However, there were moments when I set the book aside for days, unlike the first book, which I eagerly devoured.",

The Forever King’s eerie communication through a decaying puppet and the uncertain fates of characters like Aaron and Baptiste keep the narrative unpredictable.

            "I appreciate how Gabriel is depicted more as a human than a vampire in this book, making his love affair with Phoebe compelling. However, I found him to be less fun-loving and more serious compared to the first installment, where he had a carefree, devil-may-care attitude. While he still retains some of that edge, he’s not as entertaining as before. That said, his dialogue remains sharp and unpredictable—lines like \"Fuck my face\" are hilarious and keep me engaged.\n\nGabriel’s sister, who narrates part of the story, adds a dark and intriguing perspective. I enjoy her storytelling, despite her inherently dark character. \n\nThe villains in this book are genuinely menacing, which I appreciate. They’re not laughable or over-the-top; instead, they evoke real fear. The fights between Nikita and Lilith are particularly entertaining, as they behave like toddlers, which is both hilarious and fitting for their chaotic, evil personalities.",

They embody a yin and yang dynamic, with Celene representing the lesser evil, albeit still quite dark and peculiar.

It felt unrealistic for Gabriel to recount intimate and intricate details, like his steamy sex life, with such ease. I hope the series moves away from this format in future books.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Celene’s story and her eerie, evil upbringing away from Gabriel. They feel like yin and yang, with Celene being the lesser evil but still pretty bad and weird. I thought Astrid might make a comeback, and I still think Kristoff might bring her back as a plot twist or due to missed clues. I also want Patience to return, though I’m not as invested in her since she died young and barely had a personality.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing irked me at times because it felt repetitive. Descriptions of the past, songs, hymns, and people’s quirks were repeated too often. For example, the constant reminder that Dior grew up in the streets of Lashaame became tiresome. I wish the author showed more than told, as this is a cardinal rule of writing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Unresolved Questions:**  \n  I’m confused about Queen Margot’s importance and how she fits into the world/universe.

The battle scenes, in particular, were brilliantly detailed, making me feel like a pawn moving across a chessboard, witnessing every character’s perspective.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Every character was given their due, none were forgotten, and each felt integral to the story. The narrative embraced them all, giving them purpose and solidifying their place in the tale. The focus shifted more toward emotions and the characters (or human-like creatures), which I loved.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While the world-building took a backseat in this installment, it didn’t diminish the richness, expansiveness, or overall concept of the world. The author’s ability to weave in subtle details and create unexpected twists was exceptional.\n\n- **Themes and Creativity:**  \n  The philosophical undertones and the way reality is camouflaged within this fantastical world are masterfully done. Few authors can blend these elements into a cohesive whole and leave you thinking, “Wow, that was exquisite.” The creativity, style, and Gabriel’s character make this book endlessly lovable.\n\n- **Audience and Appeal:**  \n  This is undoubtedly one of the best vampire books, but it’s strictly for adults. It’s a demanding, colorful read, though not as brilliant as the first book. It still ranks among the top reads of the year for me—unique, unpredictable, and one-of-a-kind. It’s addictive, like sanctus, leaving you craving more blood, brutality, sex, and breathtaking storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending calmness with chaos, and offering a unique narrative style that takes time to appreciate. While it may not surpass the first installment, its creativity, character depth, and philosophical layers make it a standout read. It’s a demanding yet rewarding experience that leaves you yearning for more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the reader implies it ranks highly among their top reads of the year, though not as exceptional as the first book in the series."

The narrative centers on Gabriel De Leòn’s quest to end the sine die, intertwining the fates of Dior Lachance and Celene. The plot is intricate and filled with unexpected twists, particularly towards the end, and is told through multiple narrators, including Liathe.

            "When I began *Empire of the Damned*, I anticipated a reading experience similar in length to *EotV*. However, my journey through this book felt much quicker. I'm uncertain whether this perception stems from the actual time spent reading or the nature of the content. While there are numerous adventures, I ultimately reached the end feeling as though neither I nor the characters had made any significant progress.",

His thirst intensifies, and he grapples with lingering religious trauma and resentment, all while fearing the loss of another important person. These internal conflicts are, in my view, the strongest aspects of the book, alongside Gabe's witty banter with the Grail. After the vibrant characters of the first volume, I anticipated a new, colorful cast. Unfortunately, the few new characters introduced felt flat, lacking the depth I hoped for, leaving me with a rather two-dimensional supporting cast this time around.",
            "I recently re-read *Empire of the Vampire* before starting the latest installment, and I found it just as enjoyable as the first time. My original review praised it as the author's best work, and I still believe that. It's a powerful and immersive epic fantasy. Although the re-read took longer than anticipated due to its rich content, the journey is well worth the time invested."

My original review of that book claims it’s Kristoff at his best, and I stand by that. It’s a solid, heavy-hitting work of epic fantasy. The re-read took longer than expected, but so much happens, and it’s a journey worth dedicating your time to.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  When I started *Empire of the Damned*, I expected it to take me just as long as *EotV*. However, my journey through this book felt much shorter. I’m not sure if that’s based on literal time spent reading or the content itself. There are lots of adventures, but I still got to the end and felt like I (and the characters) hadn’t gotten anywhere.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  *EotD* picks up where *EotV* left off, following Gabriel as he attempts to deliver the Grail to someone who can help end daysdeath. Gabriel’s thirst is getting worse, his religious trauma and resentment remain present, and he’s scared of losing yet another important person. These internal struggles are, in my opinion, the best parts of the book, along with Gabe’s banter with the Grail.  \n\n- **New Characters:**  \n  After losing many vibrant characters from the first volume, I expected to be introduced to a new colorful cast. However, there are minimal new characters in this book, and they fell flat for me. I wanted well-rounded characters but felt like I had to settle for a rather two-dimensional supporting cast this time around.  \n\n- **Anticipation for the Trilogy’s Conclusion:**  \n  I’m still eagerly awaiting the trilogy’s conclusion because I’m very invested in the outcome of this saga. I need to know what happens with the tension between Gabriel and his interviewer, the significance of the moth (or moths) fluttering around the captive’s tower, and the fate of the Grail.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I’d still recommend this book, though not as wholeheartedly as the first one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Damned* maintains the epic fantasy tone and compelling internal struggles of its protagonist, it falls short in introducing memorable new characters and delivering a sense of progression.

            "I was disappointed that the author killed off Dior only to resurrect her at the last moment, leaving the story unresolved. It felt like a cruel twist. I also have mixed feelings about Connor, Phoebe’s husband, being found alive only to die shortly after—this left me questioning the purpose of his brief return. Furthermore, I’m puzzled about how being inside the Chaissan Keep will help them end the endless night. There are numerous unanswered questions, particularly regarding Dior’s fate: is she truly dead, or is this all a ploy to gain access to the keep and resolve the conflict?",

I also enjoyed the budding relationship between Dior and Reyne and hope something more develops between them because they’re cute together.\n\n- **Mysteries and Speculations:**  \n  I’m left with so many questions. Is Dario a traitor? Is he working with Gabriel and Celine? Is he Joaquin the hound boy? Are they all there on purpose? Did they set this up intentionally? I need answers, but I know I’ll have to wait since the book just came out. I’m also trying to recall what happened to Fabien Voss—he’s most likely still “alive.” The deaths of Nikita, Lillidh, and the Twin Terrors during the fighting added to the intrigue, but I’m still piecing everything together.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’m deeply invested in this series despite the frustrations with the writing style and unresolved plot points.

            "In this installment, Gabriel, the captive silversaint, narrates his quest to protect the Grail child, Dior. The plot is compelling, featuring Gabriel's interactions with his vampire sister and a mix of old and new allies. The tension escalates with Gabriel and Dior's separation and Dior's capture by ruthless vampire nobles. Notably, the story avoids clichéd tropes that plagued the original, leading to a satisfying climax where various plot threads converge seamlessly. The action scenes are gripping, even for readers who typically shy away from action-heavy narratives. With strong pacing and no dull moments, this middle chapter of the trilogy remains dynamic and engaging throughout.",

Characters who initially appear one-dimensional are given the opportunity to develop, highlighting the author’s skill in creating depth.

Her pompous and exaggerated tone contrasts effectively with Gabriel’s sarcastic demeanor, resulting in some memorable one-liners.",

The worldbuilding, character development, and action sequences are standout elements, and the story’s climax is incredibly satisfying. While the theological reveal falls a bit flat and the banter can be overdone, the exploration of faith, love, and sibling dynamics adds depth. The switch to Celene as a narrator is a clever and enjoyable addition. Overall, this is a compelling read that leaves me eagerly anticipating the next installment.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  - The story continues with Gabriel, the captive silversaint, narrating his journey to protect the Grail child, Dior.  \n  - The plot is engaging, with Gabriel being joined (or plagued) by his vampire sister and other allies, old and new.  \n  - The separation of Gabriel and Dior, and Dior’s captivity by vicious vampire nobles, adds tension and stakes to the narrative.  \n  - The story avoids indulging in overused tropes and plot points, which was a complaint in the original.  \n  - The various forces and plot points converge in a satisfying and massive climax, avoiding the typical middle-chapter sag often seen in fantasy trilogies.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Creativity:**  \n  - The worldbuilding is impressive, with creative clashes of powers and abilities that enhance the story.  \n  - The theological elements, while a bit underwhelming in their reveal, add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  - The exploration of faith and love, particularly through sibling relationships and the dynamic between the protagonists and antagonists, is compelling.  \n  - Characters who initially seemed one-dimensional get their chance to shine, showcasing Kristoff’s ability to develop them meaningfully.  \n  - The switch to Celene as a narrator is a clever device, allowing for multiple scenes to be addressed simultaneously. Her pompous and overblown tone contrasts well with Gabriel’s sarcastic and flippant demeanor, and she delivers some great one-liners.  \n\n- **Action and Pacing:**  \n  - The action scenes are gripping and draw the reader in, which is notable for someone who doesn’t typically enjoy action-heavy sequences.  \n  - The pacing is strong, with no lulls, making the middle chapter of the trilogy feel dynamic and engaging.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Tone:**  \n  - The banter, while occasionally excessive, adds personality to the characters.  \n  - Celene’s narration provides a fresh and entertaining perspective, balancing the tone of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis volume of the series is a strong follow-up, avoiding the pitfalls of its predecessor and delivering a well-crafted, engaging narrative. The worldbuilding, character development, and action sequences are standout elements, and the story’s climax is incredibly satisfying. While the theological reveal falls a bit flat and the banter can be overdone, the exploration of faith, love, and sibling dynamics adds depth. The switch to Celene as a narrator is a clever and enjoyable addition. Overall, this is a compelling read that leaves me eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot felt stagnant and repetitive, with the same events occurring to the same characters for the same reasons. We received little new information about Dior and her powers until the very end, where answers finally emerged. The story lacked the usual plot twists expected from the author, with the only genuine surprise being the ending. However, that conclusion left me eager for the third book. Despite its shortcomings, this installment effectively sets the stage for what’s to come.",
            "I have a deep appreciation for both Dior and Gabriel; they are iconic characters who stood out in this book. While Dior demonstrated significant growth, Gabriel seemed to regress, particularly in his actions towards the end. Nevertheless, their interactions were still memorable, and I love their dynamic and the way they learn from one another.",
            "The book is filled with a wealth of information, which left me feeling overwhelmed by the end. While I appreciate the storytelling approach, the introduction of an additional narrator detracted from its effectiveness in this instance.",

While I enjoyed this one, it wasn’t as entertaining or smooth as the first. It felt repetitive, and for most of the book, the story didn’t seem to be going anywhere.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I love Dior and Gabriel—they are both iconic, and they were still a highlight for me in this book. However, while both characters evolved in the first book, this time only Dior showed growth. Gabriel seemed to recede a bit, especially with some of his actions towards the end. Despite this, they still had great moments together, and I adore their dynamic and how they learn from each other.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot lacked evolution and felt repetitive, with the same things happening to the same characters for the same reasons. We barely got new information about Dior and her powers until the very end, where we finally got some answers. There were almost no plot twists, which is unusual for Kristoff, and the only moment that truly shocked me was the ending.  \n\n- **Narration and Writing Style:**  \n  The book is packed with a lot of information, which gave me a headache by the end. I still appreciate how the story is told, though it didn’t work as well in this book because of the addition of another narrator.  \n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for the Next Book:**  \n  The ending left me wanting the third book as fast as possible. Despite its flaws, it was a great setup for what’s to come.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Damned* didn’t live up to the first book in terms of entertainment, pacing, and plot development, it still has its strengths, particularly in the characters of Dior and Gabriel.

            "The story continues seamlessly from the previous installment, with Gabriel and the Chronicler frequently referencing details that may have slipped your mind. However, the pacing is noticeably slower than in the first book, making this installment feel more like a bridge than a progression of the plot. I found myself less engaged and on edge compared to its predecessor, as the current plotlines were largely predictable. We didn’t encounter any major events or resolve the lingering questions left at the end of the first book. \n\nThe climax features an epic battle scene that is thrillingly written and skillfully shifts between perspectives. Yet, the stakes felt diminished, especially since we are still far from the story's conclusion and many threads remain unresolved. While certain sections, such as the stay in Dun Maergenn and the final battle, were particularly well-executed and engaging, much of the book felt inconsequential in light of what we already know.",
            "The introduction of new characters felt awkward, as they seemed to have been present during the events of the first book without any prior mention. If they truly existed then, they should have been referenced at least briefly. The narrative also shifts perspectives, providing a fresh viewpoint on the story. Initially, I was uncertain about this change, but as I became familiar with the new narrator and their role, I grew more comfortable. However, this character often felt like a device to highlight the intrigues and conflicts of House Dyvok. Ironically, this section turned out to be the strongest part of the book.",
            "The world remains intricately crafted, but this installment leans more towards character development than the plot-driven focus of the first book. While this shift isn't necessarily negative, it is noticeable. Although there are intriguing mysteries, the book raises more questions than it answers, leaving the initial sense of freshness somewhat diminished.",
            "The author clearly invested significant effort into this book, showcasing commendable and well-crafted sections. However, much of the narrative felt lacking in weight relative to the established stakes. If the next installment maintains this enthusiasm while offering a tighter pace, more events, and clearer answers, I believe it will be a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. I'm placing my full trust in Part 3!"

Gabriel and the Chronicler often remind or refer back to information you might have forgotten. However, the pacing felt slower compared to the first book. This installment felt more like a bridge, with the story barely moving forward. I found myself less excited and less frequently on edge than with its predecessor. Based on the current plotlines, I could mostly predict what to expect, and we didn’t reach any major events or uncover important elements that were left as questions at the end of the first book.\n\n- **Character Introduction and Development:**  \n  New characters were introduced, but I didn’t like how they were integrated into the story. It felt as though they had supposedly been present during the events of the first book, yet they were never mentioned. If they had existed during the writing of the first book, they should have been referenced at least briefly. The narrative also shifts perspectives, offering a different viewpoint on events. Initially, I was unsure about this change, but once I understood who we were following, their role, and how they fit into the story, I felt more at ease. That said, the new narrator felt more like a tool to showcase the intrigues and conflicts of House Dyvok, though this section turned out to be the best part of the book.\n\n- **World-Building and Plot Focus:**  \n  The world remains well-crafted and intricately built, but this installment felt more character-centric compared to the plot-driven nature of the first book. While this isn’t inherently bad, the shift was noticeable. There are intriguing mysteries, but instead of satisfying answers, the book raises even more questions. The freshness I felt with the series has somewhat faded.\n\n- **Action and Climax:**  \n  The book ends with an epic battle scene that is incredibly well-written, thrilling, and masterfully alternates between different perspectives. However, the stakes felt lacking, especially since we’re still far from the story’s conclusion and so many threads remain unresolved. Certain sections, like the stay in Dun Maergenn and the final battle, were particularly well-done and engaging, but much of the book felt inconsequential in the grand scheme of what we already know.\n\n- **Overall Satisfaction and Expectations:**  \n  Jay Kristoff clearly put a lot of work into this book, and there are commendable and well-written parts. However, much of it felt weightless compared to the established stakes. If the next installment is written with the same enthusiasm but with a tighter pace, more events, and more answers, I can’t imagine it not being a satisfying and superb conclusion to the trilogy. I’m placing all my trust in Part 3!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this installment had its strengths, such as the intriguing new perspectives and the well-crafted battle scenes, it felt like a transitional book with slower pacing and fewer significant developments.

I especially appreciate the father-daughter relationship between Gabriel and Dior; it’s sweet, complicated, and often hilarious.

One of my favorite aspects of the books is the vividly crafted world, especially the intriguing portrayal of vampires, their origins, and the distinct \"families\" they belong to. The strong Australian flavor adds to the charm, with colorful and unique insults that stand out. The characters' dialogue is highly stylized, which contributes to the book's uniqueness, though it occasionally became frustrating. I found myself wishing for just one page of normal conversation, especially from the vampires. Additionally, Gabriel's melodramatic tone and sanctimonious attitude tested my patience at times."

While this adds to the uniqueness, it got a little annoying at times. I wished they would talk normally for just one page, but they rarely did, particularly the vampires. Gabriel’s melodramatic tone and sanctimonious attitude also became insufferable, testing my patience.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The book dragged in places and could have been about 100 pages shorter. This affected my overall enjoyment and prevented it from being a 5-star read for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the dark, gritty world and the unique characters, the overly stylized dialogue and pacing issues held the book back from being a perfect read for me.

However, my complaints are purely subjective feelings about a book for which I had enormous expectations and hopes after the first volume.\n\n- **Character Development (Vampires):**  \n  The portrayal of the \"old\" vampires brilliantly shows how eternity dulls, or even kills, all human reflexes and emotions, leaving only depravity and cruelty. This was so vividly depicted that it was impossible not to be emotionally moved by it.\n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The second volume and the continuation of the adventures of Srebroświęty and Graal delivered a lot of emotions—from deep sympathy to tears, and even hatred. I am a huge fan of the story told by Gabriel. It exudes so much pathos and extreme emotions that it hits straight to the heart.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  It probably won’t surprise you that I didn’t like the second perspective. It was like driving a Porsche and then switching to a Multipla. Seriously. I was hugely disappointed. While I understand the author’s intent, I will never forgive him for it. This perspective completely failed to convince me, and I struggled through it.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  Kristoff served up a very bloody volume, sometimes quite literally. I managed to predict some things, which doesn’t reflect well on the spectacular plot twists, because you should know that I’m not usually good at foreseeing what will happen.\n\n- **Comparison to the First Volume:**  \n  After the first volume, which completely blew me away, the second one seems... ordinary. There wasn’t that \"picking my jaw up off the floor\" effect. However, this doesn’t change the fact that both volumes rank at the top of my favorite fantasy, and I hope the third volume will be comparable to the first, not the second.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some subjective disappointments, \"Cesarstwo Potępionych\" remains an exceptional fantasy series. The second volume, while not as groundbreaking as the first, still delivers intense emotions and a compelling narrative. I eagerly anticipate the third volume, hoping it will recapture the magic of the debut.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I appreciate the narrative choice to shift to Celene and follow Dior’s journey, it came at the cost of the sass and banter that Gabriel provided.

While I understand the narrative choice to switch to Celene to follow Dior’s journey, it meant sacrificing the sass and banter that Gabriel brings.

            "In questo secondo volume, la narrazione di Gabriel prosegue, esplorando gli eventi che hanno portato alla morte del Re Sempiterno e al destino del Graal di Santa Michon. Insieme a lui c'è la sorella Celene, mentre entrambi assistono il caro Jean Francois nella stesura della sua opera. In questo capitolo ritroviamo vecchi amici e ne facciamo di nuovi, ma assistiamo anche a una scia di morte: il sangue scorre a fiumi, con squartamenti, violenze, pianti e disperazione, tutto ciò che ci si aspetta da un libro dell'autore.",

Sebbene Gabriel rimanga il solito stronzo, Jean si diverte a stuzzicarlo, e Celene alterna tra il singolare e il plurale mentre esprime il suo disprezzo per tutto e tutti. Tuttavia, ciò che ho amato di più è l'evoluzione del rapporto tra Gabriel e Dior.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The second installment of the series continues the interview between the noble-blooded vampire chronicler and Gabriel de Leon, revealing what happened after the dramatic conclusion of the first book. The story is action-packed, dangerous, and filled with moments of loss, love, and deception. However, some developments felt overly dramatic, and the frequent use of last-minute rescues became a dominant trope.\n\n- **Character Perspectives:**  \n  I appreciated the expansion of perspectives, with the interview alternating between Gabriel and his sister. Their contrasting perceptions of events added depth to the narrative. However, the sudden introduction of a sibling rivalry theme felt unconvincing and didn’t fully resonate with me.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was still a thrilling and enjoyable read. Kristoff’s signature dark and provocative style keeps the story entertaining, and the series remains, in my opinion, the best vampire novel series out there. I highly recommend it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Das Reich der Verdammten* didn’t quite meet my high expectations, it was still a captivating and fun read. The expanded perspectives and Kristoff’s bold storytelling style make it a standout in the genre, even if some elements felt overdone or unconvincing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 out of 5 stars."

            "The narrative and plot were compelling, with a cinematic quality and well-executed pacing. I appreciated the balance between slower, less impactful scenes and the action-packed moments, as the former significantly enhanced the world-building. The narrative structure, especially the in-world retelling, was a highlight, expanding on the first book and introducing intriguing elements of historiography and unreliable narration. As the story progressed, it built tension with intriguing clues suggesting a potential conspiracy or major plot twist in the next installment.",
            "The action and fight scenes, particularly from pages 600 to 750 during the climax, exhibited a noticeable YA cringiness that felt somewhat lackluster. However, this was effectively balanced by the book's grimdark and realistic horror elements, contributing to a more mature overall tone.",

I appreciated the balance between slower, less-impactful scenes and action-packed, exciting ones. The slower scenes contributed significantly to the excellent world-building.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I enjoyed the narrative structure, particularly the in-world retelling of the story. This was expanded upon compared to the first book and introduced an interesting element of historiography and unreliable narration. It built up towards the end with intriguing clues hinting at a potential conspiracy or big plot twist in the next (and possibly final) book in the series.  \n\n- **Tone and Maturity:**  \n  There was a noticeable amount of YA-ness/cringiness in some of the action/fight scenes, especially from pages 600-750 during the final climax, which felt a bit lame to me. However, this was well-balanced with the grimdark/realistic horror and dark elements throughout the book, giving it a more mature feel overall.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  I really loved the central themes explored in the book, such as losing and gaining faith, blood vs. chosen family, and parenthood (especially the dynamics between dads and daughters). These themes added depth and emotional resonance to the story.  \n\n- **Author Connection:**  \n  As a bonus, I was excited to learn that the author is Melbourne-based, which added a personal touch for me. I’m super keen for the next book in the series to come out!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a strong follow-up to the first book, with a cinematic narrative, excellent world-building, and intriguing narrative structure.

            "That ending was incredible! I initially theorized that Dior wouldn’t restore daylight, and instead, Gabe and Phoebe would have a child destined to be humanity's savior. This belief stemmed from the duskdancers' notion that the prophecy involved one of their own. However, with Dior seemingly alive, I might have been mistaken. And that twist with Connor? Wow! He had no dialogue and died twice—what a shock! The first 30% of the story felt slow, but once Celene betrayed Gabriel on the bridge, the pace really picked up.",
            "One thing is certain about Dior: she’s always in search of romance, no matter the circumstances. In Book 1, she was involved with Saoirse (a character I disliked due to her predatory behavior). Then, she developed a crush on Phoebe, Saoirse’s cousin who had just died for her, which I found questionable. Next came Reyne. For Book 3, I hope she either commits to Reyne or embraces being single—if she survives, that is."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel had a slow start but became more engaging as the plot progressed. The ending was unexpected and left me questioning my theories about the prophecy.

I had a whole theory that Dior wasn’t going to bring daylight back. Instead, Gabe and Phoebe were going to have a child, and the child was going to be the savior of humankind. The reason I believed in this theory is because they mentioned that the duskdancers thought the prophecy pertained to one of their own being the savior. But now that Dior seems like she’s alive (?), maybe I’m wrong?  \n\n- **Character Development (Dior):**  \n  One thing about Dior? She’s gonna have a romance. Doesn’t matter what’s going on around her; she’ll find a way lol. In Book 1, it was Saoirse (who I disliked because…child predator), then she had a crush on Phoebe at the beginning (which I was judging Dior for because that’s Saoirse’s cousin who just DIED FOR YOU), then it was Reyne. Let’s stick to Reyne or just be single for Book 3 (if she’s alive, that is).  \n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  That Connor plot twist?? Omg. That man had no dialogue and died twice.

The middle third loses some momentum, especially after re-reading the first book, which felt tighter and more purposeful.  \n\n- **Writing and Author's Engagement:**  \n  I sense that Kristoff might have had slightly less fun writing this book, particularly in the middle section. While the first book felt like nothing was wasted, this one occasionally feels like a 'serial' where danger or sex is added, though these scenes do surprisingly advance the plot.  \n\n- **Character Development and Voice:**  \n  Kristoff’s narrative voice is strong, but it sometimes makes characters like Celene and Gabriel sound too similar, to the point where another character has to explicitly point out their similarities. Despite this, the characters are surprisingly well-rounded, and the number of characters (including returning ones) that I genuinely care about is impressive.

While some twists were predictable, the emotional intensity, rich world-building, and engaging narrative made it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

It feels drawn out, and I believe the story could have been effectively told in 200 fewer pages.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  There is plenty of character development, which adds depth to the narrative.  \n- **Plot-Lines:**  \n  The book features interesting plot-lines that keep the reader engaged despite the slow pacing.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is long-winded, and some parts, particularly in the middle of the book, feel tough to get through.  \n- **Content (Gore and Sex):**  \n  The excessive gore and detailed sex scenes felt overbearing and unnecessary to hold the reader’s interest.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book a lot and am eagerly anticipating the third installment.  \n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  I hope the third book is released soon so I don’t forget the events of the first two books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the sequel to *Empire of the Vampire* suffers from slow pacing and overly detailed content, it still offers engaging character development and plot-lines. Despite its flaws, I found it enjoyable and am looking forward to the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Continuity and Setting:**  \n  The book picks up right where the previous one left off, immersing readers back into the dark, bloody world created by Kristoff. The setting is bleak and filled with hopelessness, which is a defining feature of the series.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style can come across as arrogant at times, which I found grating in Kristoff's other series. However, in this book, the characters are well-suited to this style, making it more tolerable and even fitting.\n\n- **Characterization and Dialogue:**  \n  I love the banter in the present storyline, and it’s equally present in the past. There are small interruptions that, while not advancing the plot, add depth to the characters and enhance the overall enjoyment of the novel. These moments help balance the otherwise oppressive tone of the world.\n\n- **Artwork and Visuals:**  \n  The inclusion of art in this series is a standout feature for me. The images perfectly match the tone of the books and are incredibly helpful, especially for someone like me who tends to skim lengthy character descriptions. Seeing how the author envisions the characters adds a layer of immersion and clarity.\n\n- **Gratitude and Acknowledgment:**  \n  I’m grateful to HarperCollins for providing me with a copy of the book to review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book successfully continues the dark and immersive narrative of the series, with strong characterization, engaging dialogue, and stunning artwork that enhances the reading experience. While the writing style can be polarizing, it works well within the context of this story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This was a thoughtful addition that helped me dive right into the story.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  I really enjoyed the dynamics and relationships between the characters. They were engaging and added depth to the narrative, though I found myself not particularly caring for Dior for reasons I can’t quite pinpoint.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n  While the reading experience was pleasant overall, I felt the story could have flowed better if Jay Kristoff had avoided using childish humor at times. Gabriel de León’s constant sex jokes and baselessness became tiresome, though I suspect this is just part of the author’s signature style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some issues with the humor and certain character preferences, I had a fun time reading *Empire of the Damned*. The recap, engaging character relationships, and overall narrative made it an enjoyable experience, even if the humor occasionally detracted from the story’s fluidity.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

This applies to characters like the silver saints, thralls, and Dior.  \n- **Character Development:** I found the characters and their stories to be interesting.  \n- **Series Comparison:** I will read any future books, but I enjoyed the first book in the series more than this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an engaging story and compelling characters, the pacing felt drawn out, and the escalating violence and recovery stretched believability. Despite these issues, I remain interested in the series, though I preferred the first book over this installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

While I enjoyed it slightly less than the original due to some unnecessary filler side quests that contributed to the lengthy word count, the storytelling remains gripping.

It evokes a wide range of emotions and keeps the reader deeply engaged.  \n- **Immersion:** The narrative made me feel as though I was a small part of the story, sitting on the shoulder of Jean-Francois, witnessing and scribing the tale myself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJay Kristoff’s continuation of the Holy Grail story is a masterful blend of emotion, intrigue, and artistry. While the print version was challenging for me, the audiobook brought the tale to life in a way that felt deeply personal and immersive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK!!!! Does it mean what I think it means?! ARGH! The ending was so bloody epic and satisfying that I can mostly overlook my reservations about the book as a whole.\n\n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n  Kristoff really is a master of the epic fantasy tale. He also swears a lot, and extremely creatively, and this makes me happy: I will read his books for this reason alone.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I like that we've moved on the story a fair amount, which doesn't always happen in the second book. I also sadistically enjoyed that we got to see more of Fabien's family, and the other Houses, and also to get an insight into why Gabe and Celene hate each other so much (well, more than in book 1).\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The exploration of Fabien's family and the dynamics between Gabe and Celene added depth to the characters and their relationships.\n\n- **Criticisms:**  \n  The poor horses (IYKYK). Seriously, can we stop? I also am not sure I loved this one as much as book 1. Additionally, I don't know where we are going to go from here, so I'm a bit unsettled as to what is coming next...\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a thrilling and satisfying read, with a masterfully crafted ending that left me eager for more. While I had some reservations, particularly regarding the treatment of the horses and my preference for the first book, the epic conclusion and rich character development made it a worthwhile experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In my thoughts, *Empire of the Damned* fell short compared to the first installment by a smidgen but still held up very well.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Kristoff writes in a manner that is easily digestible, yet manages to remain adequately descriptive.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Gabe's characterization (particularly his philosophical issues with faith) was my favorite part of *EoTV*, and I was thrilled to see all the ways in which this part of his character continues to develop as we begin to dig a bit further into his many flaws through the perspective of another narrator.  \n  Dior also gets ample opportunity to shine without relying on Gabe, which was fantastic.\n\n- **Relationships Between Characters:**  \n  I enjoyed the way that the relationships between characters (both old and new) were explored, with my favorite being the strained alliance between Liathe & Gabe. I have SO much to say about these two and think that Kristoff did a phenomenal job with them in particular.  \n  I really liked the development we see with Gabe & Phoebe.\n\n- **Use of Profanity:**  \n  I have no qualms with the swearing; I find it humorous and fitting at the right times. The issue for me is that rather than saving it for those ideal moments, Kristoff overdoes it a bit. If it was just medieval cussing I wouldn't have as much of a gripe with it, but some of the phrases border on sounding akin to modern slang and that type of profanity ruins my immersion. My ultimate complaint is: curse all you want, but at least make it sound like something I would overhear in a tavern as opposed to the bar on the corner.\n\n- **Inclusion of Explicit Content:**  \n  I picked this book up for the action, fantasy, and gore; I could have done without the smut. I didn't think it added anything important that a reader couldn't have inferred from a more fade-to-black scene. I know this isn't the first time in this series there has been sex (Astrid, numerous examples of vampire debauchery), but this felt like the longest entry of the sort. Not a prude and didn't really care about the content, just didn't really want to read a chapter of it when I was invested in the main plot.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  It suffers a bit from middle-book syndrome but successfully sets readers up for a thrilling conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Empire of the Damned* is a great addition to the series! Despite a few minor issues, it delivers compelling character development, intriguing relationships, and sets the stage for an exciting finale.

            "The book's quality felt inconsistent throughout. The first half featured underwhelming deaths, while the final chapters were overwhelming, akin to opening 15 browser tabs at once.

It would have been more impactful if Maryn’s mother had awakened to save Dior instead. Additionally, the vampire's presence in the exact location Celene insisted she wasn’t felt like a predictable twist. At times, the author placed characters in overly dire situations, relying on convenient coincidences for their rescue.",
            "Gabriel's storyline with Phoebe was disappointing. I envisioned him as a character driven by the desire to avenge his family and join them in death, rather than becoming entangled in a romantic subplot. However, Celene's manipulation of Gabriel—adding her blood to his wine and inciting him to strike Dior—was an intriguing twist. The shifting narrators kept the story engaging, preventing any single plotline from becoming tedious, a welcome change from the time jumps in the previous book. Unfortunately, the Polish edition's illustrations often spoiled the plot by revealing events several pages in advance. For instance, while Astrid was just entering Gabriel's bedroom, the illustration showed a wounded Phoebe discovering Gabriel's ignorance. Similarly, Dior was still in a cage talking to Isla, but the illustration depicted her hugging Baptiste."

However, the inclusion of child trauma, explicit content, and graphic violence—such as Dior being 16, Fabien depicted as a young boy, and Maryn—did not resonate with me. While I can tolerate themes of misogyny, pretentiousness, and flowery language, the heavy emphasis on child-related trauma felt unsettling, particularly from a parent's perspective.",

Receiving an eARC was a blessing, and I was thrilled to dive into one of my most anticipated reads of 2024.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  I adore Kristoff’s writing style, which strikes the perfect balance of pretentiousness—enough to keep me intrigued without being off-putting. His use of summaries, whether overt or subtle, is one of my favorite aspects of his work. The narration, reminiscent of *Nevernight* (e.g., “gentlefriends, gentlereaders”), adds a familiar charm.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story picks up right where *Empire of the Vampire* left off, following the massacre at San Michon. New layers of lore are introduced, and the inclusion of multiple character POVs keeps the narrative engaging. Despite the book’s length (700+ pages), I found it hard to put down once I started reading.  \n\n- **Characters and Dialogue:**  \n  The banter between the Historian and the Chevalier is a highlight, filled with comedy and wit that I absolutely love. Each character feels well-developed, and I remain invested in their journeys.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The story is masterfully told, blending heartbreaking moments with gory and dark elements. However, the inclusion of child trauma, gore, and explicit content (e.g., Dior being 16, Fabien appearing as a young boy, Maryn) was a miss for me. While I can handle misogyny, pretentiousness, and flowery language, the excessive focus on child-related trauma felt uncomfortable, especially as a parent.  \n\n- **Critiques and Observations:**  \n  The book required more brainpower than usual due to its language embellishments, which made it a bit slumpy for me. Additionally, a glaring double name typo near the end was distracting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some critiques, I still love Kristoff’s writing and remain invested in the story. The rich lore, new characters, and compelling narrative ensure I’ll be reading the third book, especially with that cliffhanger ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Vampire* was a 6/5 for me, this installment felt slightly less impactful, though still highly enjoyable."

The sheer volume of story made it slightly overwhelming at first, but by the end, I was completely sold.  \n\n- **Narration and Pacing:**  \n  The change in narration felt like a bit of an adjustment initially, but it didn’t detract from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I had worried it would feel like the first book had been drawn out and repeated, but there was so much character development that it read completely differently.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The evolution of the worldbuilding was impressive and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  There were a few parts where I struggled with the character relationships, particularly some of the sexual references. I know others have had similar issues with this as well.  \n\n- **Originality in Vampire Fiction:**  \n  As someone who reads a lot of vampire fiction, it’s hard to find stories that present vampires in a truly original way. This series captures the image of the monstrous undead while blending it with more complex moral ideas.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Books:**  \n  The only downside is now I have to wait ages to find out what happens next!  \n\n- **Comparable Works:**  \n  Books with similar vibes include *Interview with the Vampire* by Anne Rice, *Dracula* by Bram Stoker, *Empire of the Vampire* by Jay Kristoff, and *A Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial challenges with pacing and character relationships, this book delivered a richly layered story with compelling character development, innovative worldbuilding, and a fresh take on vampire fiction.

            "The book was tedious, slow, and overly complex, detracting from my reading experience. At over 600 pages, the plot felt aimless. I had hoped the interview format from the first book would be abandoned, but it returned, alternating between Gabriel and Celene as they recount their experiences to a historian. The story centers on Dior's capture by the Dyvok vampires and Gabriel and Celene's attempts to rescue her, but the inclusion of confusing religious lore muddled the narrative. Despite the violence and battle scenes, I found myself disengaged. The ending left me perplexed and diminished my rating; a major revelation felt insignificant, raising more questions than it answered. This cliffhanger approach has made me less eager for the final book.",
            "I hoped to forge a deeper emotional connection with the characters, but unfortunately, that didn’t occur. We didn’t spend enough time with Gabriel or Dior, and Celene felt underdeveloped. Although some aspects of her mysterious past were revealed, I still feel I lack a full understanding of her character.",
            "In this book, I began to grasp the criticisms surrounding the author's writing. His inclination to portray underage female characters as gay and to include explicit sex scenes—some of which are non-consensual—seemed gratuitous and overly focused on the male gaze. Although the language was less provocative than in the first book, juvenile humor and swearing remained prevalent.",
            "I approached this book with high expectations, anticipating a five-star read like *Empire of the Vampire*. Unfortunately, it only delivered three stars, a step down from the four I awarded the first installment. I suspect this is a case of middle book syndrome."

However, it fell short, earning only three stars compared to the four I gave the first book. I suspect this is due to middle book syndrome.  \n\n- **Pacing and Complexity:**  \n  The book was boring, slow, and overly complicated, which hindered my reading experience. The plot felt like a whole lot of nothing, especially considering the book’s length of over 600 pages.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The interview format from the first book was retained, which I had hoped would be dropped. This time, the story alternates between Gabriel and Celene recounting their experiences to the historian.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wanted to develop a stronger emotional connection to the characters, but this didn’t happen. We didn’t spend enough time with Gabriel or Dior, and Celene remained underdeveloped. While her mysterious past was partly revealed, I still feel I don’t know enough about her.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The plot revolved around Dior being captured by the Dyvok vampires and Gabriel and Celene trying to rescue her, with confusing religious lore added in. Despite ample violence and battle scenes, I wasn’t excited or invested in them.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  I began to understand criticisms of Jay Kristoff’s writing in this book. His tendency to make underage female characters gay and include explicit sex scenes (some non-consensual) felt gratuitous and male-gaze-y. While the language was toned down compared to the first book, juvenile jokes and swearing were still present.  \n\n- **Ending and Cliffhanger:**  \n  The ending confused me and lowered my rating. A big revelation lacked significance, leaving me with more questions than answers. This cliffhanger approach made me less excited for the final book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a disappointment compared to the first installment.

            "The narrative, recounted by Gabriel and Celene, is captivating. As readers, we are left in the dark about how these powerful beings became prisoners of Margot Chastain, as well as the fates of the Forever King and Dior. We uncover the story alongside Jean-Francois, making this structure particularly effective in this context.",

            "This book could easily be 200 pages shorter while still effectively conveying its story. It is unnecessarily filled with excessive words and sentences meant to 'set the tone,' but they ultimately fall flat. It reads like a 16-year-old edgelord who has just discovered Edgar Allan Poe and is trying too hard to evoke a gothic atmosphere. This is my primary issue with the book, as the story itself is genuinely excellent.",
            "I am captivated by the world the author has crafted. The vampires are portrayed as emotionless, dangerous killers, devoid of human thought and feeling. Each encounter with a powerful vampire places our heroes in genuine peril, even if they manage to survive. The atmosphere is undeniably bleak; unlike other novels that treat humans as mere chattel, Kristoff confronts the horror of this reality head-on. I also appreciated the world of half-beasts and their deep connection to magic and nature, which feels like a natural extension of the universe established in the first part."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building:**  \n  - I love the world Kristoff has created here. The Vampires actually feel like emotionless, dangerous killers. They don't think or feel like humans do, and every time a powerful one is encountered, our heroes are in actual danger (even though they still seem to survive everything).  \n  - The world is hella bleak. While other novels talk about Vampires using humans as chattel, Kristoff doesn't shy away from showing us the horror of it.  \n  - I loved this world of half-beasts and their connection to magic and nature. It felt like a natural extension of the world created in the first part.  \n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  - This book could be AT LEAST 200 pages thinner and still tell the same story, and tell it well. It's needlessly packed with extra words and sentences to 'set the tone,' only it doesn't.  \n  - It feels like a 16-year-old edgelord who read Edgar Allen Poe for the first time and thought they could evoke gothic or something. This is honestly my main gripe with this series, because the story itself is excellent.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  - The way it's written as being recounted by Gabriel and Celene is intriguing. We, the readers, do not know what happened for both of these powerful creatures to have ended up prisoners of Margot Chastain, or what happened to the Forever King or Dior. We're discovering what happened at the same pace as Jean-Francois is finding out. That kind of structure works great in this setting.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - This installment introduced an amazing new female character, Phoebe. I loved everything about the Highland and their culture.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Commitment to the Series:**  \n  - I was very, very much in doubt about part one. So much so I wasn't sure if I was going to pick up the sequel. But I'm glad I did because it's such a step up from the previous installment.  \n  - I'm convinced. I'll read the final novel in the series. Gladly so.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its flaws, particularly in its overly verbose prose, the world-building, narrative structure, and character development make it a compelling read. Despite my initial doubts, I found this installment to be a significant improvement over the first and am eager to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Lachlan and Kiara were the only new characters I enjoyed. I missed Astrid, Chloe, and the Company of the Grail. Aaron, Baptiste, and Celene were disappointing, with Celene being my least favorite character in both books. Jean-Francois, the historian, is the only character I’m truly rooting for now.\n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  Kristoff excels at writing action scenes, but the constant use of \"Thee's and Thou's\" by the Dyvok strain became tiresome, even though the book poked fun at it. The audiobook narration didn’t help with this issue.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  Despite my disappointment, I will definitely read the third volume. I hope the series extends beyond a trilogy so I can move past this installment and fall in love with the series again.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I remain a fan of the series and the author, this sequel fell short of my expectations. The plot felt predictable, the character development was lacking, and the pacing was rushed. However, I’m hopeful that future installments will recapture the magic of the first book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the pacing in the first half felt uneven. While Book 1's frenetic narrative structure provided memorable moments and strong character development, Book 2 becomes mired in exploring the consequences of the first installment and Celene's choices, resulting in excessive bickering and a lack of clear focus. Fortunately, the second half of the book regained its momentum.",

Both characters are engaging and contribute positively to the narrative.",

Book 1’s frenetic narrative structure delivered great moments and character development, but Book 2 gets bogged down exploring the ramifications of Book 1 and Celene’s options, leading to bickering, back-and-forth, and unclear focus.  \n  - The second half of the book found its footing better.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n  - The book explores another vampire bloodline, the terrifyingly strong Dyvok, which I really loved.  \n  - Despite being explored quite a bit, the Esani and the 5th vampire bloodline are not clearly explained. I understand their history but not their current goals.  \n\n- **Tone and Content:**  \n  - The book ramped up the sex scenes, tripling the count from Book 1.

For example, his line “I didn’t need my ribs anyway” during a life-or-death situation felt more like an MCU quip than something fitting the gravity of the moment.  \n\n- **Characterization of the Highlanders:**  \n  As a Scottish reader, I found the way the Highlanders spoke distracting. The overuse of “nae” felt awkward and made me wonder if this is how non-Scots perceive Scottish speech. While this is a personal issue, it took me out of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Lore:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I still find the overarching plot, setting, and lore quite interesting. The seeds planted for the next book have caught my interest, and I plan to read the sequel when it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t live up to the first one for me due to its overly bleak tone, forced dialogue, and distracting portrayal of the Highlanders, I remain invested in the overarching story and lore. I’m hopeful the next installment will address some of these issues.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book continues Gabriel de León's narrative to his vampiric captors, mirroring the first installment. This time, however, it employs a dual-narrator approach, introducing an additional voice that weaves through Gabe's story. This technique enriches the narrative and prompts questions about the reliability of their perspectives. The first third of the book feels slow and meandering, resembling a travelogue that can verge on dull, especially given its nearly 700-page length. However, the pace picks up significantly with the introduction of the second narrator, infusing the story with renewed energy.",
            "The introduction of the Dyvok siblings as primary antagonists adds a refreshing dynamic to the plot. However, I find the relationship between Gabe and Dior unconvincing, likely stemming from my disappointment with the ending of the first book.",
            "The bleak, post-apocalyptic world dominated by vampires is undeniably compelling. Although the author categorizes the book as grimdark, I discovered elements of heroic fantasy interwoven throughout the narrative, adding a unique dimension to the story.",
            "Fans of dark fantasy will likely appreciate this sequel, which expands on the established setting and characters. However, if the first book didn’t captivate you, this middle installment probably won’t change your mind. The unanswered questions and intriguing revelations in the finale have me invested in the trilogy.",

However, this time, there is no dual timeline but instead an additional narrator interspersed throughout Gabe’s tale. This dual-narrator approach adds depth and raises questions about the reliability of their accounts.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The bleak, post-apocalyptic world where vampires have seemingly taken over remains compelling. While the author labels the book as grimdark, I found elements of heroic fantasy woven into the narrative, which adds a unique flavor to the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The first third of the book feels slow and meandering, with a travelogue-like quality that borders on dull, especially given the book’s length (nearly 700 pages). However, the pace improves significantly once the second narrator is introduced, injecting new energy into the story.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The introduction of the Dyvok siblings as primary antagonists brings a fresh dynamic to the plot. However, I remain unconvinced by the relationship between Gabe and Dior, possibly due to my dissatisfaction with the ending of the first book.\n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**  \n  Fans of *Empire of the Vampire* will likely enjoy this sequel, as it builds on the established setting and characters.

            "The story presents several implausible plot points that challenge believability. For example, the idea of a single wolf shifter feeding multiple vampires is hard to accept. Additionally, it’s difficult to understand how shifters could fail to recognize one of their own in beast form, given that their appearances remain consistent. The dyvok’s decision to kill humans rather than sustain them for blood also seems illogical and shortsighted, especially since humans can naturally replenish their blood supply.",
            "In this story, Gabriel, as the narrator, lacks a sense of real danger since he recounts events after they occur, which diminishes the overall tension. Dior's behavior also undermines her street-smart persona; she trusts others too readily, ignoring obvious red flags, such as witnessing someone leave a room with blood on their mouth. Furthermore, Gabriel's feelings toward Dior are ambiguous, fluctuating between romantic and paternal, creating an unsettling dynamic.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **World-Building and Originality:**  \n  The concept of five vampire families with the eldest sleeping to avoid insanity, awakened by blood poured into their mouths through floor runnels, feels derivative, reminiscent of *Underworld*. I’m unsure if this is a common trope in other vampire stories, but it didn’t strike me as particularly original.\n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n  Gabriel, as the narrator, never feels in real danger since he’s recounting the story, which diminishes tension. Dior’s behavior is inconsistent with her supposed street-smart persona; she trusts people too easily, even when there are clear red flags, like seeing someone leave a room with blood on their mouth. Additionally, Gabriel’s feelings toward Dior are ambiguous, oscillating between romantic and paternal, which feels unsettling.\n\n- **Plot Logic and Coherence:**  \n  Several plot points strain believability. For instance, a single wolf shifter feeding multiple vampires seems implausible. Similarly, shifters failing to recognize one of their own in beast form doesn’t make sense, as their forms don’t change. The dyvok’s wasteful behavior—killing humans instead of sustaining them for blood—feels illogical and shortsighted, especially since humans naturally replenish blood.\n\n- **Tone and Potential Adaptation:**  \n  While the novel has flaws, its over-the-top and cartoonish elements could work well as a game or movie series, similar to *Underworld*. It has a campy appeal that might translate better visually.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel has intriguing ideas but suffers from inconsistent character behavior, illogical plot points, and a lack of originality in its world-building. While it didn’t fully satisfy me as a reader, its exaggerated tone could make it a fun adaptation in another medium. I’m glad I borrowed it from the library rather than purchasing it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

However, this entry suffers from second book syndrome, which impacted my overall enjoyment.\n\n- **Character Development (Gabe’s POV):**  \n  Gabe’s perspective really dragged for the bulk of the book. One section of his POV was particularly painful, as it felt like an unnecessary side quest that cheapened Gabe and Astrid’s love story. Astrid was one of my favorite characters from the first book, and Gabe’s love for her was a strength and anchor, so I was disappointed by certain choices made in this book.\n\n- **Found Family Dynamic (Gabe/Dior):**  \n  I felt the development of the Gabe/Dior found family angle could have been slower and more nuanced. It didn’t resonate as strongly as I had hoped.\n\n- **Narrative Structure (Historian’s Interjections):**  \n  The interjections from the historian felt more interruptive compared to the first book, which disrupted the flow of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing (Dior’s Storyline):**  \n  Dior’s storyline was the strength of this book. The Dyvok vampire hold was menacing and terrifying, the stakes felt real, and everything moved at a good pace, actually pushing the plot forward. The highs were really high, but the middling portions dragged the overall experience down.\n\n- **Open Plot Lines:**  \n  The book leaves us with interesting open plot lines, which gives me hope that the magic from the first book will be recaptured in the third installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Vampire* had some standout moments, particularly in Dior’s storyline, it struggled with pacing issues, underdeveloped character dynamics, and narrative interruptions.

            "In the second installment of the trilogy, Gabriel continues to narrate to Chastain’s historian, but this format feels less effective than in the first book. Much of the narrative comes across as filler. Aaron's transformation into a vampire raises intriguing questions; despite vampires lacking souls, he defies his master for love. How is this possible? Additionally, Celene's care for Dior, who also lacks a soul, adds to the confusion. Is there a darker agenda at play, or is this a plot hole?",
            "In this story, we experience Celene’s perspective, which mirrors Dior’s, after she is captured by the Dyvok and separated from Gabriel. The narrative primarily follows Gabriel's quest to reunite with Dior while she struggles to survive the Dyvok's clutches. The author’s portrayal of the Heartless is particularly effective; Liathe is both creepy and menacing, adding to the tension. The twist of Baptiste thwarting Dior’s escape is unexpected and well-executed. Kiara’s betrayal is compelling, while Isla’s, though predictable, is still satisfying. Nikita’s cruelty ultimately leads to his downfall, a strong narrative choice. Additionally, Lachlan’s backstory enriches his character, adding depth to the overall story.",
            "The theme of being \"ever outnumbered, never outmatched\" resonated powerfully throughout the story.",

I was often surprised by how some characters survived the brutal things done to their bodies.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Intrigue:**  \n  Learning about the fifth line was fascinating, as was the introduction of conflict among the vampire courts.

A poignant quote from page 566, Chapter I: Stormbringer, beautifully captured this:  \n  *\"She'd told me that we don't get broken, but that we're made so. and we were wounded, the pair of us, sure and true; both still bleeding from the wounds life had carved in us, the loved ones torn away from us.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Opening Recap:** I loved that the book opened with a recap of the characters and where we left them at the end of the first book. It was helpful to refresh my memory.\n- **Ending:** The very end felt unpolished, and I didn’t like it. It left me wanting more closure.\n- **Battle Scenes:** Listening to a dark romance playlist on Spotify during the intense battle scenes really improved my experience. It added an extra layer of immersion.\n- **Illustrations:** The drawings were interesting but didn’t add much to my reader experience. However, I found the cover helpful and intriguing.\n- **Pacing:** Some parts of the book felt labored, while others seemed rushed. The pacing could have been more balanced.\n- **Unanswered Questions:** There were several things I needed answers to that weren’t addressed in this book. It’s frustrating that I’ll have to read a third book to get those answers, and I hope there isn’t a fourth one!\n- **Character Development:** There were slight personality changes in some characters that I found inconsistent and a bit jarring.\n- **Number of Characters:** The book introduced a lot of characters, and I’m not sure it needed that many. It felt a bit overwhelming at times.\n- **Plot Twists:** There were a few twists I didn’t see coming, which kept me engaged and surprised.\n- **Genre Appeal:** Overall, it’s still a good read if you enjoy fantasy with a bit of violence and treachery.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I found some aspects of the book frustrating, such as the unpolished ending, unanswered questions, and inconsistent character development, I still enjoyed the story. The recap at the beginning, the immersive battle scenes, and the unexpected twists made it a worthwhile read. I’m on the fence about whether I’ll read the next installment, but I’m curious enough to consider it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 on Goodreads, as halves aren’t allowed)."

This series hasn’t quite reached the same level of engagement for me yet.  \n\n- **Content Warning:**  \n  This series is not suitable for children.

Given that this is an adult fantasy, I feel there are too many fade-to-black moments and teasing rather than actual, detailed scenes. While it might sound like I’m only interested in a gory smutfest, my point is that if an author promises something as provocative as a bloody bj, they should follow through.\n- **Anticipation for the Next Book:** I’m mildly excited for book three, but my expectations are tempered based on my experience with this installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I enjoyed Celene’s perspective and found the story more engaging once her POV was introduced, the pacing was slow, and some storytelling choices, like killing off a character prematurely, didn’t sit well with me.

While this might be subjective, it significantly affected my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book felt like a step down from its predecessor, lacking the depth, mystery, and emotional engagement that made the first book so compelling. While it had its moments, it didn’t capture the same magic for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3🌟"

On a positive note, the introduction of new characters was refreshing, and the villains were so well-crafted that I found myself hating them passionately—exactly what a good villain should inspire.

While I did enjoy it, I found it didn’t quite hold up to the first one. It lacked the same gripping intensity and felt a bit repetitive at times. For instance, I noticed how often Gabriel seemed to get into dire situations only to be miraculously saved at the last minute, which became predictable.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of the first book was the interactions between Gabriel and Jean-Francois. The tension and suspense between them in the first book were electric, but that dynamic felt noticeably absent here. Their relationship didn’t carry the same weight or intrigue.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these criticisms, I still enjoyed the hell out of this book. It was a fun and engaging read, even if it didn’t grab me by the balls quite like the first one did. I’m definitely looking forward to the follow-up and potential finale.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel didn’t quite match the brilliance of its predecessor, it was still an enjoyable read.

Additionally, the repeated use of “moonsblood” became tiresome and felt like an odd obsession.  \n\n- **Internal Logic and Consistency:**  \n  The story occasionally breaks its own internal logic, particularly when it comes to justifying actions with “because love,” which felt contrived and undermined the world’s credibility.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Empire of the Damned* had its flaws—such as awkward sex scenes, repetitive language, and inconsistent logic—it was still an enjoyable read that left me curious about the next book. The lore and characters were strong enough to keep me engaged, though the writing could have been more polished.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This has significantly reduced my enthusiasm for continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I had a great time reading it!  \n\n- **Chronological Order:**  \n  - I still wish Kristoff had written the books in chronological order.  \n\n- **Vampire Lore Development:**  \n  - The vampire lore feels underdeveloped. For instance, why are some vampires somewhat good people while others are not, simply because their humanity has been “burned away with time”? Wouldn’t all vampires be the same? Additionally, if ancient vampire blood can bind others to their will, can no vampires truly be held accountable for their actions?  \n\n- **Character Development (Astrid):**  \n  - I still wish Astrid was more of a character beyond being Gabe’s wife.  \n\n- **Tone and Shock Value:**  \n  - Kristoff toned down the edgelordness, which I appreciated, but he still couldn’t escape his need for shock value. For example, a character returns from the dead just to die again two pages later. Another example is a mountain lion in the previous book turning out to be a sexy, red-haired shapeshifting woman that the main character then bangs. It can be a lot to take in.  \n\n- **Strengths (Characters, Action, World-Building):**  \n  - Despite the faults, I loved the characters, the action, and the introduction of the heinous Dyvok clan.

It almost feels like a campy parody of the first one, and I really hate it. I adored the first book and was so excited for this one that I preordered two copies (British version signed and the American version) and the Audible version.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The jokes are getting stale, and the overall tone feels off. The smutty stuff is cringe, and certain elements, like Kristoff’s obsession with women’s periods, are gross and confusing. The way it was written in a weirdly sexual manner, especially after Gabriel expressed fatherly feelings toward Dior, was particularly off-putting.  \n\n- **Fight Scenes and Action:**  \n  The fight scenes are getting repetitive. So many fights and battles happen in the beginning, yet the plot doesn’t move an inch. It’s also tiring to read about Gabriel being completely wrecked and then recovering repeatedly.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Gabriel’s relationship with Dior has gotten really weird to me. The dynamic feels inconsistent and uncomfortable, especially with the strange sexual undertones.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing is really weird in this book. Despite all the action early on, the plot feels stagnant and doesn’t progress meaningfully.  \n\n- **Favorite Character:**  \n  Ironically, out of all the characters, my favorite one is the vampire who’s recording the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Interest:**  \n  At this rate, I’m not sure I’ll even buy the third book. Maybe I’ll give this one another try eventually to see if my standards lower enough to enjoy it, but for now, I’m disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell short of my expectations, especially compared to the first one.

Gabriel's narrative style also felt off, as it didn’t align with how someone would naturally tell a story, especially someone as \"edgy\" as him.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the plot itself was interesting, it was overshadowed by the slow pacing. The story struggled to hold my attention, and I often lost interest after just a few pages. The pacing made the reading experience feel like a chore.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt like cardboard cutouts, lacking depth and relatability. This made it difficult for me to connect with them or care about their journeys.\n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I initially wanted to love this book, especially after enjoying Kristoff’s previous works like *The Illuminae Files* and the first two books of *The Nevernight Chronicles*. However, my excitement quickly faded as I struggled to get into the story. By the 50% mark, I decided to DNF (Did Not Finish) because I no longer felt invested.\n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  My relationship with Kristoff’s writing is mixed. While I’ve loved some of his series, others, like *LIFEL1K3*, lost my interest. This book fell into the latter category for me, despite my initial high hopes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial enthusiasm for *Empire of the Vampire* and its sequel, *Empire of the Damned*, I ultimately found the writing style, pacing, and character development to be major drawbacks. The story failed to engage me, and I decided to stop reading halfway through. I doubt I’ll give it another try in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- *Empire of the Vampire*: ★★★★ (4 stars)  \n- *Empire of the Damned*: ★★ (2 stars) ~ DNF at 50%"

It imagines a world where the Harkonnens from *Dune* are vampires ruling unchecked.  \n\n- **Pros:**  \n  - The map illustrations are gorgeous and add to the visual appeal.  \n  - The catch-up notes at the beginning are helpful for understanding the world.  \n  - The Nightblood-style talking blade is a creative element.  \n  - The opening line is a fantastic hook.  \n  - The writing is stylistically well done, earning an extra star for quality.  \n  - The world-building and country dynamics are well-crafted.  \n  - The exploration of religion, cults, and belief as a tangible force is intriguing.  \n  - The reveal is well-executed, making the teaser ending effective.  \n\n- **Cons:**  \n  - The book immediately dives into graphic themes like s*x and bl*od slavery, setting a harsh tone.  \n  - The male main characters are masochistic and sadistic, treating women as tools and using derogatory language.  \n  - The author comes across as an \"edgelord,\" prioritizing shock value and offensive content for attention.  \n  - The only female character who receives respect is a teenage girl, and even she is subjected to jokes.  \n  - The concept of \"Slaughterfarms\" is disturbing, though no explicit scenes are shown.  \n  - There are numerous small yet glaring derogatory phrases against women, with too many to count by page 50.  \n  - A grown man inappropriately unloads his emotional burdens on a child who just survived a near-death experience.  \n  - The main character uses crude language and unnecessary \"yo mama\" jokes for shock value.  \n  - The dialogue is dominated by the main character, leaving little room for others.  \n  - The illustrations, while well-done, are graphic and explicit.  \n  - The author fixates on cat fights and petty squabbles between women.  \n  - There are two instances of gruesome and needless animal cruelty involving horses.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building, writing quality, and creative elements like the talking blade and map illustrations, its reliance on shock value, derogatory treatment of women, and graphic content overshadow its strengths.

My interest in future installments is minimal, limited to possibly reading a Wikipedia summary for closure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggles with inconsistent worldbuilding, underdeveloped characters, and a predictable plot, despite its intriguing premise. While it may appeal to younger readers or fans of grimdark themes, it fails to deliver a satisfying experience for those seeking depth and quality in literature.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

While this tone might have been tolerable if the story was engaging, it became a significant drawback due to the lack of interest it generated.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book felt incredibly boring, to the point where listening to it felt like a chore. Every time I pressed play, it was like an assignment, which made it difficult to stay engaged or motivated to continue.\n\n- **Content and Scenes:**  \n  There are a couple of sex/passionate scenes in the book, but they felt unnecessarily long and cringy. This might have been less noticeable for readers of the physical book compared to the audiobook experience.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I pre-ordered the book after enjoying the first one, but this sequel failed to meet my expectations. The combination of uninteresting content and over-the-top tone made it impossible for me to finish.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement after enjoying the first book, this sequel fell flat for me. The excessive \"edge lord\" tone, lack of engagement, and cringy scenes made it a disappointing read. I ultimately could not bring myself to finish it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I didn’t feel the desire to pick it up or any sadness about not reading it for a day. Even trying to read it alongside the audiobook, which helped with the first book, didn’t work this time.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I didn’t like the direction the relationship between Gabriel and Dior was taking. It felt cringe-worthy and disgusting to me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Commitment:**  \n  I decided to DNF (Did Not Finish) the book and the series. The book was too dense and unengaging, and I won’t bother continuing with such a lengthy read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book failed to capture my interest, and I found it tedious and unenjoyable.

The dialogue between these battles often feels disjointed and fails to enhance the story or develop the characters. Certain scenes, like the training of the apprentice, come off as clichéd, reminiscent of subpar action films. The book's length feels excessive due to its repetitive structure and minimal progression. Additionally, the pacing, dominated by relentless action and violence, becomes monotonous over time.",

Additionally, the portrayal of the evil vampires feels exaggerated and poorly executed, resembling subpar imitations of Anne Rice's style.",
            "The conversations in the story lack depth, failing to enrich either the characters or the plot. The repetitive dialogue becomes tedious, prompting readers to skim through sections. Additionally, the tone occasionally shifts, resembling a young adult novel rather than a mature fantasy. The inclusion of cheesy vampire erotica and exaggerated violence further undermines the narrative's overall quality."
