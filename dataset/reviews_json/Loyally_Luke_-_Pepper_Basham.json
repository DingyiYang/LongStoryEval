Each chapter opened with a texting scene, which disrupted the flow of the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters, Luke and Elliana, were uninteresting and failed to capture my attention.  \n  - The lack of clarity in point of view made it difficult to connect with the characters. For example, I initially assumed a chapter was from Luke's perspective, only to later discover it was Elliana's inner monologue.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing felt poorly executed, with disjointed transitions and unclear perspectives.  \n  - The reliance on texting as a narrative device did not work well and detracted from the overall storytelling.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  - I was intrigued by the synopsis but found the execution disappointing.  \n  - I regret not stopping sooner, as the book failed to hold my interest beyond the first few chapters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of *Loyally Luke* by Pepper D. Basham initially intrigued me, the execution fell short. The characters were uninteresting, the writing style was disjointed, and the overuse of texting as a narrative device made the story difficult to engage with.

Yes, please! The story culminates in a delightful happily ever after for both characters, but I won’t spoil the details—you’ll have to read it to find out!",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Luke is a standout character with his sarcastic humor, which made me laugh out loud repeatedly. His relationships with his sisters, cousin, and Ellie are well-developed and endearing.  \n   - Ellie is a fun and complex character with a relatable redemption arc.

            "This book is brimming with romantic tropes, witty banter, and palpable chemistry between the characters. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of family relationships, along with the engaging texts and emails that add depth to the story. While the narrative is light-hearted, it unfolds deeper, more serious elements that enrich our understanding of the characters. Character development shines, especially in the determined ice princess overcoming her past and the loyal, legendary grumpy teddy bear. The supporting cast is equally delightful, making the read all the more enjoyable.",

The series as a whole is a must-read, and this book, in particular, stands out for its witty banter, chemistry, and character growth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They worked well and complemented each other wonderfully.  \n\n- **Romantic Depth:**  \n   - I don’t mind kissing or thinking about kissing in my fiction, but I want the romance to have depth and solidness before and beyond the kissing.  \n   - This one came so close and yet fell so short.  \n\n- **Sibling Dynamics:**  \n   - The book was worth reading if nothing else to continue the conversations between the siblings.  \n   - I could read a lot more books about these siblings. Why do series have to end at the wedding?  \n\n- **Content Notes:**  \n   - A lot of talk about kissing as well as some extended kissing scenes.  \n   - Some mentions of inappropriate situations and photos in Ellie's past (shown as something she has repented of and left behind).  \n   - A couple of vague hints of wanting to do more than kissing, a couple of which felt like honest struggles and a couple that felt pointlessly awkward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed certain aspects of the book, such as the character development of Luke and Ellie and the sibling dynamics, the romantic relationship between Luke and Ellie lacked the depth I was hoping for.

Some standout quotes include:  \n     - *“Was it possible his little sister was writing this scene of his life and cackling from her omniscience?”*  \n     - *“Your kiss is dangerous, Mr. Edgewood.” Her breath came shallow, gaze roaming from his lips back to his eyes. “Not at all like one of the good guys.”*  \n     - *“You need more practice then, princess.” His hand tightened on her back, tugging her back toward him. “All good guys have a little bit of rogue for the right woman.”*  \n     - *“And you’re going to be ok with that?”*  \n     - *“Life’s full of hard choices, Pete.” Luke looked down at his half-eaten sandwich, his appetite gone. Sometimes between two good choices, you have to pray, consider, and hope you chose the best one for all the right reasons.*  \n     - *And if you don’t?*  \n     - *“You make the best of your choice and do the next right thing.”*  \n\n- **Audio Quality (if applicable):**  \n   - The audio version was fabulous.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n   - The content included kissing only, references to previous poor choices, and no language.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a super cute and well-balanced novel that delivered swoony, clean romance with a touch of humor and faith.

Luke recognizes Ellie's need for friendship and is particularly pleased to find someone who hasn't watched a Hallmark movie. As Princess Elliana prepares to reenter royal life after a lengthy sabbatical to recover from past mistakes, she is resolved to serve her country effectively. Luke brings a refreshing perspective—not only because he is unaware of her past, but also due to his straightforward worldview.",

Princess Elliana is about to reenter royal life after taking a lengthy sabbatical to recover from a string of poor choices.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engaging Characters:**  \n  - I was immediately drawn into the world of Izzy, Penelope, Josephine, and Luke Edgewood.  \n  - Luke’s character is tough and sarcastic on the outside but tender and loyal at heart.  \n  - Princess Ellie’s redemption story and her bucket list added depth to her character.  \n  - The comical text messages between the Edgewood family members were a highlight.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  - The meet-cute at the coffee shop was charming and set the tone for the romance.  \n  - Luke and Ellie’s chemistry, especially their kisses, was beautifully written.  \n  - Pepper Basham’s skill in writing romantic moments earned her the title of “Queen of Kissing.”  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The dazzling country of Skymar felt so real that I even googled it to see if it existed!  \n  - The small, quaint town of Crieff and the antique shop with its lovable, meddling owners added charm.  \n  - The renovating of a castle turned orphanage and the cast of sweet orphans Luke befriends created a heartwarming backdrop.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - Themes of faith, hope, and family resonated deeply.  \n  - The tight-knit family dynamics and the feel-good nature of the story left me uplifted.  \n  - There were countless laugh-out-loud moments that balanced the emotional depth.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The car ride to the Royal ball and the countless movie references added fun and excitement.  \n  - The story works perfectly as a standalone, though reading the other books in the series enhances the experience.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  - The book is clean, with no language and only kisses/closed-door scenes.  \n  - The Hallmark-like chime and overall tone made it a comforting and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Authentically, Izzy* is a heartwarming, feel-good novel with engaging characters, a charming setting, and a beautifully written romance. Pepper Basham masterfully balances humor, emotion, and themes of faith and family, making it a delightful read. While it works as a standalone, I highly recommend reading the other books in the series for the full experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He’s broody, sarcastic, and fiercely loyal to his family and friends. His flannel-wearing, hard-working persona makes him such a compelling character. After seeing him in the first two Skymar books, I was thrilled to finally read his story. His quirks, ups and downs, and his no-nonsense attitude (like making you watch *Rambo* as a friendship test) make him feel so real and fun to know.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Luke and Aliana):**  \n  The meet-cute (or rather, meet-sarcastic) between Luke and Aliana Roselynn St. Claire is one of the funniest I’ve ever read! Their initial clash and the way they slowly grow closer is both hilarious and heartwarming. Their journey has its ups and downs, but every scene with them together is utterly delightful.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story is packed with charming and heartwarming moments—renovations, fishing, the cabin, the Royal family, and even dressing up (and down!). The orphanage subplot adds depth, and the surprises along the way keep the story engaging. The mix of humor, vulnerability, and growth makes the plot feel rich and satisfying.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The humor in this book is top-notch! I laughed out loud during the meet-sarcastic scene and throughout the book. The balance between lighthearted moments and deeper emotional beats is perfect.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The story beautifully explores themes of loyalty, friendship, vulnerability, and love. Luke’s growth, his relationships with others, and the sweet, clean romance all contribute to a heartwarming and uplifting read.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Comparison:**  \n  If you haven’t read the first two Skymar books, do so now! This book is even better than a chick-flick or Hallmark movie—it’s a must-read for anyone who loves a good, clean romance with humor and heart.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an utterly delightful and heartwarming read, filled with humor, growth, and a sweet love story. Luke and Aliana’s journey is one you won’t want to miss. It’s a perfect blend of laughter, vulnerability, and romance that will leave you with a happy sigh.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Content: Clean (some kisses, no graphic content).  \n- Overall: A must-read for fans of clean, heartwarming romance!  \n\nHappy Reading!!!"

            "At first glance, Luke appears to be a grumpy, macho movie enthusiast, but beneath that exterior lies a remarkable man. His upbringing among women adds complexity to his character. Meanwhile, Ellie’s journey illustrates a touching story of redemption. Despite her past mistakes, she diligently strives to mend the damage and rebuild her life. Her loving and supportive parents play a crucial role, although her mother’s occasional insistence on perfection adds a relatable layer to their dynamic.",
            "Unlike the epistolary style of *Izzy* and *Penelope*, which relies heavily on texts and emails, *Loyally, Luke* features fewer messages, aligning seamlessly with Luke's character.",
            "The book gently conveys the message that we don't need to be perfect for God to love us, a sentiment that resonates profoundly.",
            "I’ve truly come to cherish the world and characters in this story. As a passionate reader, I find myself resonating with two of the strong characters, and I’ll miss the experience of discovering the story for the first time. Luke is captivating, and his movie quotes and witty remarks will be dearly missed."

        "conclusion": "*Loyally, Luke* is a heartfelt and satisfying story, with well-developed characters, relatable themes, and a perfect balance of humor and emotion. Reading the books in order is essential to fully appreciate the story and its characters.",

Skipping the first two books will leave you missing crucial dynamics among Luke and his siblings/cousin, and you’ll encounter major spoilers.  \n   - The first two books are amazing, and reading them in order enhances the experience of *Loyally, Luke*.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - Unlike the epistolary style (texts and emails) of *Izzy* and *Penelope*, *Loyally, Luke* has fewer texts, which fits Luke’s personality perfectly.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Luke is a grumpy, macho, movie-loving guy on the surface, but underneath, he’s an amazing man. His upbringing surrounded by girls adds depth to his character.  \n   - Ellie’s story is a beautiful portrayal of redemption. Despite her past mistakes, she works hard to repair the damage and rebuild her life.  \n   - Ellie’s parents are loving and supportive, though her mom occasionally emphasizes the need to “look perfect,” which feels relatable.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book subtly addresses the idea that we don’t need to be perfect for God to love us—a message that resonates deeply.  \n\n- **Emotional Connection and Personal Reflection:**  \n   - I’ve grown to love Skymar and all the characters in this series. As a dramatic bookworm, I see myself as a mix of Izzy and Penelope, and I’ll miss the joy of reading this series for the first time.  \n   - Luke is swoony, and I’ll miss his movie quotes and snarky comments.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I absolutely loved *Loyally, Luke* and the entire series. It’s a must-read for rom-com fans, and I’m sad to see it end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a heartfelt and satisfying conclusion to the series, with well-developed characters, relatable themes, and a perfect balance of humor and emotion.

            "Luke, the sole boy in his family, was raised on Hallmark movies and romcoms courtesy of his sisters. Although he never intended to experience a romcom in real life, fate intervenes when he falls for a genuine princess. Balancing his sisters' influence, his love for action films, and his naturally sweet disposition makes him irresistibly charming. The pop culture references were delightful, and Luke's character development stood out as one of the book's highlights.",
            "This book features delightful sibling text threads and emails, but I found the traditional narrative style more engaging. This shift likely enhanced my enjoyment, yet the true standout was Luke. His character was expertly crafted, and his love story was simply perfect.",
            "This story features a swoon-worthy romance complemented by humor that had me laughing out loud. The blend of heartfelt moments and comedic elements makes it utterly irresistible. If you're seeking a Christian romance that perfectly balances laughter and swooning, this book is a must-read."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Context and Standalone Potential:**  \n  While reading the previous books in the Skymar series might provide a better understanding of Luke's family dynamics, *Loyally, Luke* can still be enjoyed as a standalone. I didn’t expect to love this book as much as I did, especially since the first two books, while enjoyable, weren’t my favorites by Pepper Basham. The epistolary style of the earlier books took some time to get into, but this one, with its more traditional narrative style, was easier to connect with.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Approach:**  \n  This book includes fantastic sibling text threads and emails, but it’s primarily written in a traditional style, which I found more engaging. The shift in narrative style likely contributed to my enjoyment, but the standout element was Luke himself. His character was brilliantly written, and his love story was absolute perfection.\n\n- **Character Development (Luke):**  \n  Luke, the only boy in his family, grew up surrounded by Hallmark movies and romcoms, thanks to his sisters. While he never planned to live out a romcom in real life, that’s exactly what happens when he falls for a real-life princess. His balancing act between his sisters’ influence and his love for action flicks, combined with his sweetheart nature, made him incredibly charming. I loved the pop culture references and found his character development to be one of the highlights of the book.\n\n- **Romantic Elements and Humor:**  \n  The romance in this story was swoon-worthy, and the humor had me laughing out loud multiple times. The blend of heartfelt moments and comedic elements made the story irresistible. If you’re looking for a Christian romance that balances laughter and swooning, this book is a must-read.\n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The audiobook version was fantastically done. The narrators brought the story to life in a way that enhanced the overall experience. Their performances added depth and emotion to the characters and plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a delightful addition to the Skymar series, with a charming protagonist, a perfect blend of romance and humor, and a narrative style that’s easy to connect with.

            "When a job brings him to Skymar for a few months, the charming meet-cutes and cheerful moments can't distract him from his true love, Ellie—his Grace Kelly.",
            "From the very first book, I was captivated by Luke in all his grumpy, flannel-wearing glory. The author brings these characters to life, making them leap off the pages. Luke's disdain for romance—preferring Rambo and Star Wars—combined with his impressive self-control, honed by living with his over-the-top sisters, creates a perfect contrast to the sassy, brave, and witty Ellie. Despite his daily encounters with heart-eyed Hallmark tropes, a job in Skymar for a couple of months can't keep him away from his Grace Kelly. I found myself laughing at their witty banter and swooning at every chemistry-laden interaction.",

Additionally, the setting of Skymar felt like a European version of Stars Hollow, which immediately drew me in as a *Gilmore Girls* fan.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book had a slow start and took a while to pick up, but I decided to stick with it, hoping it would be worth my time. Thankfully, it was. The story eventually gained momentum and became incredibly engaging.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  Luke and Ellie’s relationship felt so much like Luke and Lorelai from *Gilmore Girls* that it made me emotional. Their chemistry and interactions were perfectly coded, and I couldn’t help but fall in love with their dynamic.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This is my second rom-com of the year, and it absolutely delivered. There’s something uniquely charming about European rom-coms that American ones often lack. The humor, the meet-cutes, and the countless laugh-out-loud moments made this book a joy to read.  \n\n- **Plot and Adaptability:**  \n  The plot is so well-crafted that it feels perfect for a movie adaptation. It has the right balance of romance and humor to be released around both Valentine’s Day and Christmas. The story is filled with rom-com references and moments that would translate beautifully to the screen.  \n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n  The only minor critique I have is that the book could have been slightly shorter, but this is a small issue compared to all the positives. The humor, the setting, and the characters more than made up for it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful rom-com that captured my heart. From the charming setting of Skymar to the *Gilmore Girls*-coded relationship between Luke and Ellie, it was a joy to read. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartwarming, laugh-out-loud story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The plot of this installment in the Skymar Series diverges significantly from the first two, centering on Luke Edgewood, a southern carpenter summoned to a Scottish isle. Initially light-hearted and enjoyable, the story takes a more serious turn around the halfway point, delving into themes of past struggles, bravery, self-worth, forgiveness, and restoration. While the ending occasionally feels drawn out and disjointed, it ultimately concludes in a believable and satisfying manner.",
            "This romance is refreshingly clean, featuring no profanity and plenty of sweet kisses, making it a wholesome read. Luke's dry humor and Southern charm shine through, especially in his witty exchanges with Izzy and Penelope. Their interactions are both hilarious and heartwarming, showcasing a strong camaraderie. The romantic dynamics between Luke and the princess-in-hiding are engaging and thoughtfully developed.",
            "The author's witty and charming writing, infused with Southern humor, makes the dialogue and scenes a delight. The tone effortlessly transitions from light-hearted and fun to serious and heartfelt, resulting in a well-rounded reading experience.",
            "The story effectively weaves light-hearted romance with profound themes of cancer, depression, and past struggles, ultimately conveying messages of positive change and healing. Touching moments, such as Luke comforting a girl from an orphanage, enrich the narrative with emotional depth."

        "conclusion": "This book is a delightful blend of humor, romance, and emotional depth, with a unique plot and charming characters. While the ending could have been tighter, the story is engaging, heartwarming, and satisfying. It’s a perfect read for fans of light-hearted contemporary romance with a touch of royal intrigue and true friendship.",

            "The story suffers from occasional pacing issues, largely stemming from repetitive scenarios weighing \"reasons to stay apart\" against \"reasons to be together.\" While the slow-burn romance is enjoyable, the back-and-forth tension could have been streamlined for a more fluid reading experience.",
            "In their initial meeting, Ellie St. Claire and Luke Edgewood’s interaction is somewhat hostile, but their subsequent encounter reveals a shared understanding. Luke’s internal struggle with his attraction to Ellie, a princess, and his hesitation to embrace royal life is skillfully developed. Meanwhile, Ellie’s journey of overcoming her past and proving herself to her country is both compelling and relatable. The slow-burn romance gives them the time to genuinely connect. The presence of orphans and meddling townsfolk adds charm and depth to the story, evoking a delightful “Notting Hill” vibe. While Luke’s family remains physically absent, they are humorously and insightfully depicted through text exchanges. Additionally, Ellie’s conversations with her friend provide vital context about her past and challenges."

            "The character development in this story was exceptional, allowing for deeper connections with each character. Watching Ellie embark on her journey of self-discovery and transformation into a more 'respectable' royal was delightful. Luke’s caring nature helped Ellie shed her guarded exterior, enabling her to truly be herself. Their relationship was charming and reminiscent of a Hallmark movie, yet more nuanced. I appreciated that Luke was unaware of Ellie’s royal status, which allowed them to connect on a more genuine level. However, the shift in their friendship to physical intimacy, even just kissing, felt a bit abrupt to me, though I understand that some might not feel the same. The author skillfully crafted passionate kiss scenes that added depth to their romance.",

            "This book presents a cliché romance where characters frequently highlight common tropes, culminating in a sweet ending. The first 30% felt repetitive, especially with Luke's continual rejection of romance. While the discussions about tropes aimed for humor, they often came off as annoying and excessive. Overall, the storytelling felt imbalanced; despite the volume of dialogue, it lacked depth and meaningful engagement.",
            "Ellie and her father were likable and well-developed characters, while Izzie added some enjoyment to the story. However, Penelope was often irritating, leading to frequent eye-rolls, and her narration was particularly grating.",
            "The narration was generally well-executed, but the chapters lacked clear separation between the two main characters, causing confusion, particularly in the audiobook format. The abrupt shifts in perspective were disorienting.",
            "The charming small-town setting enhanced the story's appeal, and the inclusion of the orphanage added a meaningful layer to the narrative.",

I also enjoyed the delightful texts between Ellie and her best friend Maeve.",

I wholeheartedly recommend Loyally Luke, along with the rest of the series, and I plan to add a copy to my keeper shelf. I would also love to see a Book 4 or a Christmas novella featuring my favorite characters! The humorous banter is a highlight, especially Penelope's obsession with romance tropes and Hallmark movies, which Luke finds utterly ridiculous. His reaction to the term \"meet-cute\" is priceless: he growls at his phone, disgusted by the very idea. Meanwhile, Penelope, with her sparkly shoes and glittery world, is a delightful contrast.",

            "The novel presents a charming meet-cute as the protagonist embarks on a work-related journey. The scenario is skillfully crafted and thoroughly enjoyable, with excellent pacing. The story follows Luke Edgewood, a thirty-year-old bachelor who reluctantly accepts a job in Skymar to repair an orphanage. At the airport, he unexpectedly meets a girl who later reveals herself to be the project manager.",
            "Luke is a simple, content man who enjoys his coffee, dogs, and job, with little interest in romance. However, his relationship with Aliana evolves from mild irritation to a deeper connection as they collaborate on an orphanage project. The dynamic between Luke and his sister, Penelope, brings humor and warmth, as she persistently nudges him to find love. The twist of Aliana being a princess adds an intriguing layer to their relationship.",
            "This story is a delightful and wholesome Christian rom-com. The author skillfully employs clichés like the meet-cute and enemies-to-lovers trope to establish the romantic tension. The inclusion of nerdy elements in the characters enhances their relatability and gives the narrative a contemporary vibe.",

His emotional growth throughout the story was both evident and heartwarming, particularly as he fell in love.

The way God’s presence influenced Luke’s thoughts and decisions felt natural and not forced, even though the mentions were frequent.  \n\n- **Character Development (Luke):**  \n   - Luke’s character had moments of toxic masculinity, which, given his traits and beliefs, made sense. However, the constant references to \"manly\" movies felt a bit cringe.  \n   - His emotional growth throughout the book was evident and heartwarming, especially as he fell in love.  \n\n- **Setting (Skymar):**  \n   - Skymar was a charming and well-crafted setting with the perfect small-town feel. I felt a twinge of sadness when Ellie decided to move to the US, but her happiness was ultimately what mattered.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n   - The relationship between Luke and his sisters was a highlight. I adored how they teased him but also reminded him of his worth and supported his decisions.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters (Maeve):**  \n   - Maeve, Ellie’s friend, really got on my nerves with her repeated jokes about taking Luke for herself.  \n\n- **Backstory and Depth:**  \n   - I would have loved to delve deeper into the characters’ histories instead of the glimpses we got.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n   - Despite this being the third book in the Skymar series, it was my first introduction. I plan on reading the other two books when I can.  \n\n- **Overall Balance and Appeal:**  \n   - The novel struck a great balance of romance, faith, and love.

Although Luke prefers to stay out of the spotlight, he finds himself falling for her, only to discover her true identity.",

Ellie, a princess on a journey of healing, strives to prove herself to her family and her kingdom. Luke, a grumpy yet endearing man, carries the weight of past hurts and weariness.

I also adored the side characters, particularly the children at the orphanage and the villagers who warmly embrace Luke and Ellie as family.",

It felt almost like a commentary on the concepts of tropes, which suited Luke, who would hate to be a part of one.  \n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n   - I definitely recommend this book if you loved the other Skymar books. We even get a little more updates on other characters.  \n\n- **Author’s Work:**  \n   - I’m a huge fan of Pepper Basham’s series and look forward to my next read of hers!  \n\n**Content Warnings:**  \n- Language: None  \n- Spice: Level 1.5  \n- Trigger Warnings: Minor description of past struggles. No major triggers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a satisfying conclusion to the Skymar series, with strong character development, heartwarming themes, and a unique emotional tone that suits Luke perfectly. It beautifully ties together family, belonging, and community while cleverly playing with tropes.

While each book can be read as a standalone, I recommend reading them in order for a more cohesive experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story follows Luke Edgewood, who travels to the fictional European island country of Skymar to work on a renovation project for an orphanage.

Their immediate attraction and developing relationship face significant obstacles, as Ellie cannot abdicate her royal duties and Luke has a business and family waiting for him in the U.S.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Luke is portrayed as a one-in-a-million kind of guy, while Ellie is sweet and determined to restore her reputation from a party girl to a responsible royal. Luke’s sisters provide loving support and add hilarious comic relief throughout the story.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Comparison to Previous Books:**  \n  I really enjoyed this story, though perhaps not as much as the two predecessors.

I didn't realize it was a Christian romance until I started reading, which isn't my preferred genre, and this oversight affected my enjoyment. The story heavily features familiar tropes like secretly royal characters, forbidden love, friends to lovers, and fake dating. The author embraces the genre's cheesiness and even pokes fun at it, which I appreciated."

His personality felt overdone and didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  - The book is well-written, with a lot of events packed into the story.  \n  - However, some storylines felt meandering and unresolved, suggesting it could have benefited from another round of editing.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  - While this book wasn’t for me, I can see it appealing to readers who enjoy lighthearted, trope-heavy romances.  \n  - I didn’t realize it was a Christian romance until I started reading, which is not my preferred genre. This oversight is entirely on me, but it did impact my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a sugary, trope-filled romance that leans into its cheesiness with humor and charm. While it’s well-written and packed with events, some storylines felt unresolved, and the male lead didn’t resonate with me. It’s perfect for readers who enjoy lighthearted, Christian-themed romances, but it wasn’t a match for my personal tastes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "In this charming story, Luke loyally follows a grumpy yet kind-hearted American contractor tasked with renovating an orphanage in the picturesque European country of Skymar.

            "In \"Skymar,\" Luke Edgewood arrives in a quaint town to oversee a construction project, only to find himself swept up in a charming romance upon meeting Ellie.

            "I haven't read the previous books, and while I didn't feel lost, I may not have connected with the characters as deeply. However, I really enjoyed the banter between Luke and his sisters at the start of each chapter.",

As much as he tries to resist, he falls into his own version of a Hallmark movie the minute he meets Ellie. The story is a very sweet, innocent love story that checks the Hallmark tropes list.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I have not read the other books in the series and, while I didn’t feel like I missed anything, I may not have connected to the characters as much because of this. I enjoyed the banter between Luke and his sisters at the beginning of each chapter.  \n\n- **Narration and Performance:**  \n  The female narrators did a great job. However, the main male narrator felt like he was trying too hard to be the stereotypical American cowboy. I found myself rolling my eyes at the dialogue and the accent a few times.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Suitability:**  \n  If you’re looking for a light, sweet romance, this may be for you. However, it just wasn’t my cup of tea (or in the case of Luke, coffee).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book delivers a sweet, Hallmark-style love story with charming banter and strong female narration, the male narrator’s performance and the overall predictability of the plot made it less enjoyable for me.

The narrator switching for different characters made for a very entertaining listen.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  I had to read this book because my husband’s name is Luke, which added a fun personal touch. Now he will be known as my loyal Luke!  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Thomas Nelson, the author Pepper Basham, and NetGalley for providing the advanced copy of the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful, heartwarming read with a charming European setting and engaging characters.

The story is self-contained and easy to follow without prior knowledge of the series.  \n\n- **Story Tone and Style:**  \n  The story is cute and features good characters, but I found it too saccharine and cheesy for my personal taste. It leaned heavily into sweetness, which might not appeal to everyone.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narration was great. The use of multiple narrators, with both performing all the accents, helped prevent confusion, especially since much of the story is told through text. This added depth and clarity to the listening experience.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I’d like to thank HarperCollins Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an audiobook to listen to and review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Loyally, Luke* is a charming and easy-to-follow standalone story with likable characters, though its overly sweet tone may not suit everyone.

The setting of a castle orphanage in Skymar is incredibly appealing and adds a unique charm to the story. It makes me want to experience Skymar even more.\n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  Luke’s story was hard, deep, and unexpectedly relatable. I connected with him more than I anticipated, especially sharing his affinity for the cold and his dislike of attention. As someone who has faced impossible odds, I felt the hopelessness and tension in Luke and Ellie’s situation. I also appreciated the wisdom and perspective offered by other characters who could see things more clearly.\n\n- **Moral Choices and Themes:**  \n  I admired how Luke and Ellie made hard choices based on what they knew to be right, rather than what felt good or made them happy. This added depth and authenticity to their characters and the story.\n\n- **Humor and Memorable Moments:**  \n  There are so many good moments in this book, but two standouts are Luke’s conversation with Faye (which was emotional and touching) and the car conversation between Gordon and Nessa (which was hilarious). These moments added a great balance to the story.\n\n- **Author’s Craft and Detail:**  \n  I’m curious if Pepper Basham actually watches all the action/guy movies referenced in the book or if she consulted the men in her life for help. The inclusion of movies like *Hacksaw Ridge* added a fun and realistic touch.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a deeply emotional and engaging read, with a setting that made me long to visit Skymar.

It’s a swoony, sweet, and well-executed princess romance.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - The characters are amazing—multifaceted, likable, relatable, and realistic. Ellie has a compelling past she’s overcoming, and Luke is, well, Luke. The side characters, including friends, townspeople, and children, are also fantastic.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**\n   - The Skymarian islands and the small town in the North are beautifully depicted. The setting feels perfect and immersive, making me wish these places were real.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Pepper Basham’s writing is fantastic. This is my fourth book by her, and she has become a must-read author for me. Her style consistently works for me.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is well-paced, transitioning smoothly from strangers to loves-of-their-lives. The push-and-pull of the romance against their duties and responsibilities creates real angst and emotional depth.\n\n- **Romantic Development:**\n   - The chemistry between the characters is palpable from early on. Their meet-cute, coffee banter, and the closet scene are highlights. The first kiss at 35% was thrilling, and I appreciated that this wasn’t a slow-burn romance.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The emotional moments hit hard. I had tears streaming down my face at 85% when they were saying goodbye, unsure if their love could overcome their circumstances. Ellie’s moment of walking down the stairs at the ball, holding her head high, was particularly powerful.\n\n- **Intrigue and Tropes:**\n   - While the story includes familiar tropes, the intrigue is executed perfectly. The journey is engaging, even if the outcome is somewhat predictable.\n\n- **Logic and Realism:**\n    - The story feels logical and well-thought-out. Luke falling for a down-to-earth, smart, and funny princess makes sense, and their communication about their feelings and options is realistic.\n\n- **Entertainment Value:**\n    - This book was 200% entertaining! It made me smile, laugh, and cry. I was thoroughly engrossed from start to finish.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a beautifully written, swoony, and emotionally resonant princess romance. The characters are well-developed, the setting is enchanting, and the pacing keeps you hooked. Pepper Basham has delivered another must-read novel that left me thoroughly entertained and emotionally invested.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 5 stars + I recommend forever."

            "While the story has its merits, certain elements felt excessively repetitive. It's clear that the characters can't be together in the long run, but the constant reiteration of this point became tiresome.",
            "I enjoyed Luke and Ellie, but found Luke's sisters to be quite frustrating. The background characters were much easier to connect with. While I appreciated the developing bond between Luke and Ellie, the repetition of romance tropes became tiresome. How many times must Luke resort to his \"manly\" movies and actions when feeling threatened by romance? It quickly grew old.",

            "The plot is engaging, featuring organic conflicts that foster reader empathy for the characters. The tropes are skillfully handled, notably avoiding the overuse of the Evil Ex trope, as Ellie’s ex plays a minimal role. The inclusion of discussions about faith feels natural and aligns well with character development. This book also addresses two minor issues from *Positively, Penelope*: Luke clarifies his North Carolina roots, and Penelope consistently refers to her boyfriend as Matt instead of Matthias, which is a welcome improvement. While Penelope remains present through text messages, her character continues to be as irritating as she was in her own story.",
            "Luke Edgewood is less irritating than Penelope, but the author’s heavy-handed emphasis on his masculinity is off-putting. His frequent references to macho films like Rambo, Rocky, and Mission: Impossible become repetitive. Meanwhile, Ellie, Princess Elliana of Skymar, attempts to redeem herself from past misdeeds that don’t seem particularly scandalous, making her redemption arc feel unnecessary and uncomfortable.",
            "The characters frequently alternate between banter and overly serious conversations, which often feel unnatural. The dialogue is excessively explanatory, with characters explicitly stating their thoughts rather than engaging in realistic exchanges. This leads to a \"show vs. tell\" issue, making interactions feel clunky. While the author includes numerous movie references, some are too on-the-nose, with characters directly quoting lines that could have been woven in more subtly. Additionally, there's a minor error in referring to Indiana Jones as \"Indie\" instead of \"Indy.\""

The use of limited epistolary elements, such as emails and chats, is effective; however, clearer scene breaks for the POV changes would help reduce confusion.",

In contrast, Ellie St. Clare is a well-developed character, her doubts and vulnerabilities vividly portrayed. While she makes some poor choices, she possesses the strength to recognize and own them. Luke's relationship with his sisters is delightful, and their conversations are a highlight. Penelope, a charming side character, brings an extra dose of joy with her passion for Hallmark movies and romance tropes, almost stealing the spotlight. The dynamic between Ellie and Luke is both funny and endearing, making them a lovely couple.",

            "Luke's character is gruff and grumpy, but this portrayal lacks depth, often veering into a clichéd representation of toxic masculinity, particularly in his disdain for anything perceived as \"girly.\" Meanwhile, Ellie's characterization as \"not like other girls\" feels equally trite, especially given her familiarity with Luke's references to iconic films like Rambo and Indiana Jones.",

            "The charming small-town setting effectively enhances the story. However, the fictional country of Skymar feels underdeveloped and unconvincing, resembling a lackluster version of Scotland. The name itself is jarring and lacks the allure of other fictional realms.",
            "The book heavily relies on Hallmark movie tropes, which quickly become repetitive and overwhelming, particularly with its frequent nods to its inspiration.

I was particularly captivated by the family dynamics among Josephine, Izzy, Penelope, and Luke. Their love and support for one another, encouraging each to embrace their true selves, was the highlight of the narrative. \n\nJosephine’s matchmaking and humor, Izzy’s literary passion and courage, Penelope’s creativity and zest for life, and Luke’s loyalty and kindness are all defining traits that shine through. Luke, in particular, stands out as the best brother I’ve encountered in literature. His fierce loyalty, protectiveness, and compassion create a safe space for others to be themselves, free from shame or fear. His ability to \"slay dragons\"—fears, anxieties, and uncertainties—along with his unwavering love, makes him an extraordinary character. Additionally, his humor, inspired by action films like Rambo and Jason Bourne, adds depth and relatability to his persona.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story is set on a fictional European island in the North Sea, which adds a charming and unique backdrop to the romance.  \n   - The plot revolves around Luke, a down-to-earth American carpenter, and Ellie, a princess recovering from a tarnished reputation, as they work together on a charity project renovating an orphanage.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Luke is portrayed as a relatable, humorous, and loyal character with a dry sense of humor and a preference for simplicity.  \n   - Ellie is a kind-hearted princess who is dedicated to her family and her royal duties, striving to rebuild her reputation.  \n   - The dynamic between Luke and Ellie is engaging, with their \"meet cute\" being particularly hilarious and their romance developing naturally.  \n\n- **Romance and Themes:**  \n   - The romance is delightful and explores the challenges of two people from vastly different worlds considering a future together.  \n   - The story leans more toward the male perspective, which adds a refreshing twist to the romance genre.  \n   - Themes of loyalty, family, and faith are woven into the narrative, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n   - The epistolary-style group chats are amusing and contribute to the humor and banter in the story.  \n   - The writing style is engaging, with fewer epistolary elements compared to the previous books in the series.  \n\n- **Series Context and Reading Order:**  \n   - While the books in the Skymar series are standalone romances, reading them in order (starting with *Authentically Izzy* and *Positively Penelope*) enhances the appreciation of the family group chat humor and banter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally Luke* is a heartwarming and humorous contemporary romance that combines a charming setting, relatable characters, and a delightful love story.

            "In Skymar, Luke embarks on a construction project involving an old historical building, perfectly aligning with his interests. The story weaves suspense and mystery surrounding the royal family, complemented by a heartwarming subplot featuring endearing orphans. Skymar's enchanting and historical setting adds a captivating charm to the narrative.",

Their relationship unfolds naturally, and the revelation that Ellie is a princess introduces tension and emotional depth. Luke's initial feelings of betrayal are relatable, yet Ellie's authenticity and charm make it difficult for him to let her go. While I connected with Penelope and Izzy from previous books, I found an even stronger resonance with Luke. He embodies the ideal partner—protective, genuine, and a problem-solver. His love for both romantic and masculine films adds a unique dimension to his character, making him truly memorable.",

I highly recommend reading this series in order—don’t even think about skipping ahead or reading out of order. You’ve been warned!  \n\n- **Character Relatability and Development:**  \n  I identified with Penelope and Izzy from the previous books, but I relate to Luke even more. As an introvert who prefers animals to people and avoids the spotlight, Luke’s personality resonates deeply with me. He’s the kind of guy you dream of—protective, problem-solving, and genuine. His mix of loving romance movies while also enjoying masculine films adds a unique layer to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  Luke takes on a construction project in Skymar, working on an old historical building, which aligns perfectly with his interests. The story is filled with suspense and mystery surrounding the royal family, as well as the heartwarming subplot involving super sweet orphans. The setting of Skymar adds a magical and historical charm to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  Luke isn’t looking for romance, but he finds it in Ellie, a Grace Kelly look-alike. Their relationship develops naturally, and the twist of Ellie being a princess adds tension and emotional depth. Luke’s initial feelings of betrayal and disappointment are understandable, but Ellie’s authenticity and charm make it hard for him to let her go.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story explores themes of family, loyalty, and overcoming personal limitations. Luke’s devotion to his family is central to his character, and his internal struggle between his love for Ellie and his responsibilities to his family adds emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fantastic addition to the series, with a relatable protagonist, a captivating plot, and a beautifully developed romance.

            "This novel artfully blends elements of *The Princess Diaries 2* and *The Prodigal Son*, resulting in a captivating narrative. The story centers on Luke, a contractor from North Carolina, who journeys to Skamar to renovate an orphanage. There, he unexpectedly encounters Ellie, a princess in disguise. The plot weaves together romance, personal growth, and heartwarming interactions with a charming cast of children and townsfolk.",
            "Ellie's journey of self-improvement post-rehab, along with her struggles with her royal identity and past mistakes, is compelling. Luke's initial aversion to love and his gradual softening, particularly as he bonds with Ellie over shared interests like action movies, is well-developed. The relationships between Ellie and her father, as well as Luke and his sisters, add depth and warmth to the narrative.",
            "The text conversations at the beginning of each chapter add a creative touch, though they can be somewhat confusing at first when trying to identify the characters. While the audiobook narration is excellent, it takes a bit of adjustment to fully appreciate the text conversations.",
            "The story centers on themes of redemption, forgiveness, and personal growth. The incorporation of faith and prayer is subtle, seamlessly woven into the narrative without feeling forced.",
            "The romance between Luke and Ellie develops organically, beginning with annoyance and gradually blossoming into friendship and deeper feelings. Their unconventional \"meet cute\" at the airport effectively establishes the tone of their dynamic. The tension between Ellie’s royal status and Luke’s reluctance to embrace love adds an intriguing layer to their relationship."

            "This story cleverly incorporates tongue-in-cheek references to Hallmark movies and romcom tropes, which I found amusing. While there’s no third-act breakup, the characters maintain a distance that leaves little to break. The plot stretches credibility, particularly with Luke leaving the North Carolina mountains for a construction job in the fictional European country of Skymar. Additionally, the convenience of both of Luke’s sisters finding love in Skymar in previous books felt a bit contrived.",
            "In this story, Luke emerges as the quintessential flannel-clad hero, seemingly flawless and ruggedly charming. In contrast, Ellie, the love interest, is endearing but bogged down by a series of tragic backstories that feel excessive. The storyline's plot device—one character being a royal unbeknownst to the other—comes off as somewhat absurd, particularly given the media attention surrounding them. As their relationship unfolds, Luke and Ellie find themselves at an impasse over her obligations to her family and country while he’s reluctant to leave behind his life for Skymar. Ultimately, their conflicts remain largely unresolved, and the story wraps up with an all-too-easy resolution reminiscent of a Hallmark movie.",
            "The book is well-written, featuring sections formatted as text exchanges that serve as effective quick information dumps.",
            "I entered the @goodreads giveaway for this book because the cover was adorable. The author's last name suggested some spice, but I was surprised to find the story to be quite vanilla, chaste, and almost godly—definitely not what I anticipated."

        "conclusion": "While the book is well-written and has some humorous nods to romcom tropes, it didn’t resonate with me. The characters felt one-dimensional, the plot was far-fetched, and the resolution was too convenient. It’s a sweet, chaste romance that might appeal to fans of Hallmark-style stories, but it wasn’t my cup of tea.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Characters (Edgewood Siblings):**  \n  I love the Edgewood siblings so much. They give me everything from happiness to laughter to banter to jokes—just everything nice and sweet. I don't think I've ever loved book siblings as much as I love these guys.  \n- **Character Development (Luke):**  \n  From the first book, you get a glimpse of Luke's personality, and the anticipation for his story was built so well. Luke, the words-of-affirmation individual, constantly spoke words of encouragement and praise, which I adored. He showed me that a guy doesn't have to watch kdramas or read romance novels to be romantic and caring. He can care about \"manly guy stuff\" and still show love, sacrifice, and be a supportive partner.  \n- **Writing Style (Pepper Basham):**  \n  Pepper Basham did phenomenal work with this book. It was way better than I could have imagined. Her storytelling made me fall in love with reading all over again.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book gave me all the feels—warm, fuzzy, sweet, beautiful, and funny. It’s going to be so hard to let go of these books because they were so memorable.  \n- **Series Appreciation:**  \n  The Skymar series could be 20 books with 1000 pages, and I'd still want more. I’d love a novella that includes everyone and their new families after some years. The Edgewood siblings feel like people I never want to part with.  \n- **Author Introduction:**  \n  These books were my first introduction to Pepper Basham, and what an experience it was!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book and the Skymar series as a whole were an absolute delight. The Edgewood siblings, especially Luke, were beautifully written, and the story was filled with warmth, humor, and romance. Pepper Basham’s writing is exceptional, and I’m so grateful for this series. It’s a story I’ll never forget and one I’d love to revisit again and again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The depiction of men as overly resistant to romance films—such as needing to watch *Rambo* to \"cleanse\" their minds—comes across as exaggerated and detracts from the narrative. Additionally, the frequent mockery of the romance genre is both ironic and disappointing for a book that falls within it."

They work together to renovate an orphanage in Ellie’s home country of Skymar and fall in love in the process.  \n  - I loved how Luke helped Ellie with her “regular person” bucket list and treated the kids at the orphanage with kindness.  \n  - Ellie was a hard worker and down-to-earth, which made her a likable character.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  - The book heavily emphasizes traditional gender roles and masculinity, which felt outdated and unnecessary, especially in 2024.  \n  - The portrayal of men being overly resistant to romance movies (e.g., needing to watch *Rambo* to “cleanse” their minds) felt exaggerated and detracted from the story.  \n  - The romance genre itself was frequently made fun of, which was ironic and disappointing for a book within that genre.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  - The narrators for Luke and Ellie were excellent, with no issues.  \n  - The narrators for the sisters were less impressive, as their high-pitched voices and constant squealing came across as grating rather than endearing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the book was sweet and enjoyable, particularly due to the “princess falling for the commoner” trope.  \n  - Without the overly masculine traits of Luke and the shaming of romance movies, I would have rated it higher.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a cute and heartwarming story with likable characters and a charming premise.

Balancing authenticity with her royal duties made her character compelling. The relationship between Luke and Ellie was sweet, though it occasionally veered into cheesiness.

It ties up the storylines beautifully and provides a sense of closure.\n\n- **Background and Context:**  \n  I think it’s essential to read *Authentically, Izzy* and *Positively, Penelope* before diving into this book. They provide the necessary background on why the characters are in Skymar and the family dynamics at play.\n\n- **Plot and Romance:**  \n  The story follows Luke arriving in Skymar and having a \"meet cute\" (though not so much according to Luke) with Eliana, who happens to be royal in disguise. When they reunite, sparks fly, creating a delightful romantic tension.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  Unlike the first two novels, which are mostly epistolary, this one strikes a nice balance between traditional narrative and epistolary elements. I particularly enjoyed this mix, especially in the audiobook format, as it made the story flow more smoothly.\n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  I adored that Luke got his happily ever after. As with all of Basham's books, there’s a pervasive feeling of hope throughout. The characters grow and change, and the reader learns alongside them, which I found deeply rewarding.\n\n- **Future Appearances:**  \n  I was thrilled to learn that although this series is ending, Luke will make an appearance in an upcoming book, which adds an exciting layer of continuity.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  If you're looking for a series that makes you smile and sigh contentedly at the end, this is definitely one to pick up.

This allows readers to fully appreciate the cast of endearing characters and their development across the series.\n\n- **Plot and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The story follows Luke Edgewood as he visits Skymar and meets Ellie, a princess who captivates him. Their relationship is filled with tension as they struggle between their loyalty to their homelands and their growing desire to be together. The forced (or chosen!) proximity scenes between Ellie and Luke were particularly enjoyable and added depth to their connection.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Approach:**  \n  Unlike the first two books, which were mostly epistolary in style, *Loyally, Luke* adopts a more traditional narrative style. This shift feels more \"real time\" and aligns well with Luke's character, making the story more immersive and engaging.\n\n- **World-Building and Character Development:**  \n  The length of the Skymar series books, though longer than typical contemporary romance or rom-coms, allows for rich world-building and detailed character development. The world of Skymar and the Edgewood family is vividly portrayed, making Luke's story feel complete and satisfying.\n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The book is clean, with kisses only, and includes Christian themes such as mentioning God, prayer, seeking God's will, and attending church. I appreciated the emphasis on selflessness and making choices that benefit others rather than acting out of selfishness.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a captivating addition to the Skymar series, offering a perfect blend of romance, tension, and character growth. The shift to a traditional narrative style enhances the storytelling, and the focus on selflessness and faith adds depth to the plot. Fans of the series will find Luke's story both satisfying and heartwarming.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Luke. He is loyal, sarcastic, hardworking, and fiercely loving. It was heartwarming to see him open up to Ellie and demonstrate how much his family means to him. His willingness to step outside his comfort zone for those he cares about was truly impressive. Ellie, too, is a delightful character. I appreciated her backstory and her efforts to make amends for past mistakes. Her courage and tender heart shone through, and watching her gradually let Luke into her life was a beautiful journey. The supporting characters in Skymar were equally wonderful. It was touching to see the village around the orphanage embrace both Ellie and Luke, and the friendships that formed enriched the story, positively impacting the children's lives.",

            "The royal romance elements truly stood out to me. I enjoyed the ball, the unexpected interactions with the king, and Luke's supportive role as Ellie navigated her responsibilities as a working royal. The clever incorporation of classic Hallmark movie tropes—such as chimes, snowfall, first kisses, surprises, and identity reveals—added a delightful touch.

Their love story unfolds amidst challenges such as distance, royal duties, and adult responsibilities, making it a delightful read.",

In contrast, the male protagonist, a carpenter from the Blue Ridge Mountains, initially appears gruff and prickly, exhibiting traits of toxic masculinity in his internal monologues, such as concerns about \"losing man-points.\" However, these toxic traits largely remain confined to his thoughts and do not significantly impact his actions.",

While Luke's aversion to royals is somewhat unclear, the resolution ultimately ties everything together nicely.",

            "Luke Edgewood, a stoic and occasionally grumpy flannel-wearing brother from the Blue Ridge Mountains, serves as a compelling and relatable protagonist. Elliana St. Clare, a reformed princess, is a dynamic character determined to demonstrate her love for her country and her personal growth.

The budding romance between Luke and Ellie is both heartwarming and engaging, with readers eagerly rooting for their relationship. Luke’s ability to see the “real” Ellie, beyond her royal facade, adds emotional depth to their bond.",

The synopsis confirmed the connection—Luke wears flannel and enjoys his solitude. However, I realized this was the third book in a series, so I decided to read the first two books to fully appreciate the story. *Authentically, Izzy* introduces the Edgewood siblings and follows Izzy’s journey of self-discovery in Skymar (3.5 stars). *Positively, Penelope* focuses on Penelope’s internship at the Darling House in Skymar, where she finds herself torn between brothers Matt and Alec Gray (4 stars).  \n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  In *Loyally, Luke*, Luke’s meddling sister secures him a short-term construction job in Skymar.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story follows Luke, a grumpy carpenter, who travels to Skymar for a construction job.  \n   - He has an unpleasant encounter at the airport with a woman he nicknames 'Grace Kelly,' who later turns out to be Princess Daisy of Skymar and his project supervisor.  \n   - The book is set primarily in a small town in Skymar, adding a small-town love element to the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n   - The romance is \"clean\" and contemporary, featuring tropes like royal and commoner, enemies to friends to lovers (with some nuance), and small-town love.  \n   - The story draws parallels to Hallmark movies, incorporating their tropes and clichés, but with more depth due to the book format.  \n\n- **Themes and Religious Elements:**  \n   - The book includes themes of God, prayer, and general Christian beliefs, which are noticeable but presented in a way that is palatable for non-Christian readers.  \n   - As a non-Christian reader, I found these themes present but not overwhelming, allowing me to still enjoy the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The story lacks a strong spark, tension, or suspense, which made it harder for me to feel fully invested in the outcome.  \n   - However, it serves as a light, enjoyable read, perfect for winding down after a busy day, much like a Hallmark movie.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n'Loyally, Luke' is a lighthearted, clean contemporary romance with familiar tropes and a small-town setting. While it lacks some tension and suspense, it offers a comforting and enjoyable reading experience, especially for fans of Hallmark-style stories. The Christian themes are present but not overpowering, making the book accessible to a wider audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This approach adds variety and keeps the storytelling engaging. Set in Skymar, the plot follows Luke Edgewater, who arrives for a short stint to assist with a construction project. Ellie, working on the orphanage renovation, is revealed to be a princess in hiding. Combining elements of *Roman Holiday*, a Hallmark movie, and a touch of magic, the narrative offers a familiar royal-in-disguise trope, but it's executed with charm and keeps the reader's interest.",

This is the third book in the series. While the books are standalones in terms of plot, the relationships of Izzy, Penelope, Luke, and Josephine are established in the first book and continue to develop in the second and third. I would not recommend reading this book without first reading the other two.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows Luke Edgewater, who travels to Skymar to help with a construction project, planning to stay only a few months. Ellie, who is assisting with the renovation project at the orphanage, is revealed to be a princess in hiding. The plot is a mix of *Roman Holiday*, a Hallmark movie, and pure magic. While the \"royal in hiding who falls for a commoner\" trope is well-worn, it is executed well and remains enjoyable.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told through alternating points of view (POV) of both Luke and Ellie, as well as through text exchanges between Luke, Izzy, Penelope, and Josie, and between Ellie and her friend Maeve. This format adds a lot of fun and variety to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Author’s Craft and Enjoyment:**  \n  In the hands of Pepper Basham, the story is satisfying and delightful. The writing is engaging, and the characters are well-developed, making the book a joy to read.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  I hope there is another book to come—perhaps *Just Josie*?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a charming addition to the series, blending romance, humor, and a touch of magic.

            "Luke is a standout character—blokey and rough around the edges, yet tender and thoughtful. His knack for bantering with the grumpiest tradie while caring for a young child or anticipating a princess's wishes makes him deeply endearing.

The audiobook, with its seven narrators to depict all the voices, was a unique and fun approach. The book also struck a better balance between narrative and text/email communication compared to the second book in the series, which I appreciated.\n\n- **Humor and Self-Awareness:**  \n  I enjoyed the gentle poking fun at itself in this romance. Every step of Luke and Ellie’s relationship feels like it could be part of a romcom or Hallmark movie—something Luke claims to despise. Yet, he can see all the tropes playing out in his own life, which adds a layer of humor and self-awareness.\n\n- **Romantic Moments:**  \n  My favorite part of the story was the press conference. It was incredibly romantic without a single word of romance spoken, simply because Luke did it for Ellie. This moment stood out as particularly heartfelt and meaningful.\n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  I haven’t read the first book in this series yet, but I enjoyed the second one and loved this one even more. It was a delightful read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an enjoyable read (and listen) with well-developed characters, a unique narrative format, and a perfect blend of humor and romance.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and Context:**  \n   - *Loyally Luke* is the third book in the Skymar series, focusing on Luke, the brother and cousin of the heroines from the first two books.  \n   - I recommend reading the previous stories first to fully appreciate this one.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story is set in Skymar, a small country where Luke’s relatives found their happy endings.  \n   - Luke is there for construction work, specifically on an orphanage, rather than seeking a romantic relationship.  \n   - The plot revolves around his initial conflict with a \"Grace Kelly\" look-alike at the airport, who later also works at the orphanage.  \n   - The central struggle is Luke’s love for her, which conflicts with her loyalty to Skymar and his loyalty to America.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The book is written in a less epistolary style compared to the previous books, which I found less engaging.  \n   - I listened to the audiobook, and the use of different voices for the sections enhanced my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Engagement:**  \n   - I had trouble connecting with Luke’s story as much as I did with the earlier books in the series.  \n   - Despite this, the series as a whole has been fun, and I’m sad to see it end.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - It’s a fun read, and fans of the first two books will likely enjoy this one.  \n   - I received a complimentary copy of *Loyally, Luke*, but all opinions are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally Luke* is a satisfying conclusion to the Skymar series, though it didn’t resonate with me as strongly as the earlier books. The change in narrative style and my difficulty connecting with Luke’s story slightly impacted my enjoyment. However, the audiobook experience and the overall charm of the series made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt overdone and repetitive.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The repeated mention of Ellie smelling like oranges (and once \"orange flowers\") became excessive and took away from the romance.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  There were too many points of view (POVs), and the cast felt too large, which made the story harder to follow.  \n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n  I did enjoy the Scottish brogue, which added a unique charm to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I really wanted to like this book, especially after enjoying *Authentically Izzy*, I found the religious content distracting, Luke's character overbearing, and the romantic elements repetitive. The narrative structure with too many POVs and a large cast also made it harder to connect with the story. Despite some enjoyable aspects, like the Scottish brogue, I couldn't align with the overwhelmingly positive ratings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a rating lower than the \"SO MANY 5-star ratings\" the book has received."

His behavior and dialogue, such as saying “gross, romance” or “ew, girls” upon realizing he finds a woman attractive, are off-putting.  \n  - Luke’s exaggerated masculinity, like mentioning Rambo six times in 40% of the book and claiming he needs to watch Rambo to “save his manhood” after noticing the love interest’s scent, feels overdone and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  - I was unaware this was the third book in a series, as I received it as an advanced audiobook from Harper Collins.  \n  - This lack of context may have impacted my understanding or enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I struggled to get through 40% of the book and ultimately decided not to finish it (DNF).  \n  - The characters and their dynamics were so unappealing that I have no interest in reading the first two books in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book failed to engage me due to its unlikable characters, particularly the male protagonist, whose exaggerated masculinity and repetitive references to Rambo felt overbearing. While I appreciate Harper Collins for providing the advanced audiobook for review, this story was not for me, and I won’t be exploring the rest of the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the decision to DNF (Did Not Finish) at 41% suggests a low rating."

I loved his tough exterior with his sweet heart.  \n  - Ellie grew and stood up for herself, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - Luke and Ellie were such opposites but balanced each other really well.  \n  - Their banter was wicked fun!  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  - I liked that it was hard for them to find a way to be together, and that they were able to compromise instead of one sacrificing everything.  \n\n- **Plot Details:**  \n  - I did wish they would have explained why Ellie knew all those movies Luke loved, since they seemed out of character for her.  \n  - I liked the list she had, and that Luke helped her with it.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  - It was great that Luke was her hero in some ways, but Ellie also grew and stood up for herself.  \n\n- **Series Conclusion:**  \n  - Great end to the series!  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  - The story was really cute and had a clean content rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful and heartwarming story with well-developed characters, engaging dynamics, and a satisfying resolution. While I had a minor question about Ellie's knowledge of Luke's favorite movies, the overall plot, character growth, and series conclusion made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I typically avoid contemporary romance told from the male main character's (MMC) perspective, as I often receive recommendations that focus solely on the female main character (FMC) or feature dual perspectives. However, in this case, the MMC's viewpoint was effective and didn't detract from the story. Surprisingly, the use of multiple narrators, which usually bothers me, worked well here. Although I haven't read the first two books, I find the family-centric storyline intriguing and am likely to explore the rest of the series.",

            "Throughout the book, I couldn't help but draw comparisons between Luke Edgewood and Luke Danes from *Gilmore Girls*. There were moments, particularly when Luke became more expressive with his friend, that made me think, “Luke Danes would never be that chatty!” However, I reminded myself that Luke Edgewood is a distinct character, and I tried not to conflate the two. Still, the similarities between these grumpy, flannel-wearing, fishing enthusiasts added an enjoyable layer to the story. I also appreciated the male point of view; it helped me feel more connected to Luke than to Ellie, the female lead.",

While it took some time to adjust to the accents and varying voices, they ultimately made the experience more immersive and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Author and Clean Romance:**  \n  This is my first book by Pepper Basham, and I was thrilled to discover a new go-to author for clean romance novels.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received this audiobook as an ARC from Netgalley, and all opinions expressed are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a delightful and engaging royal romance that combines humor, classic tropes, and a clean narrative. The audiobook version, with its multiple narrators, adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience. Pepper Basham has earned a spot on my list of favorite clean romance authors.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Luke Edgewood is portrayed as a grumbly hero who is resistant to romance, which adds depth to his character.  \n  - The princess in disguise introduces an intriguing dynamic to the story, making Luke's life resemble a Hallmark movie.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story revolves around Luke's journey to Skymar for building renovation projects and his unexpected romantic encounters.  \n  - The book leans heavily into romance, which may not resonate with readers who are less inclined toward romantic themes.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  - The use of multiple narrators in the audiobook format was enjoyable and added variety to the storytelling experience.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  - While the book is sweet and full of emotional moments, I found myself rolling my eyes at times, possibly because I’m not as much of a romantic as the target audience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a charming romance novel with a Hallmark-esque vibe, featuring a grumbly hero and a princess in disguise. While the story is heartfelt and enjoyable, it may appeal more to avid romance fans. The audiobook format, with its multiple narrators, enhances the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

They expect Hallmark-like events to unfold around him while he is away working in Skymar. The story involves a lot of text exchanges between the characters, creating a lighthearted and clean narrative with some humorous moments.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The sisters are portrayed as playful and persistent, always teasing their brother and expecting romantic or dramatic situations to arise. The brother’s character, while central to the plot, is somewhat overshadowed by the sisters’ antics.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The female narrators did an excellent job, keeping the story engaging and lively. However, the male narrator’s use of a fake, jokey-sounding accent was distracting and took me out of the story. I found myself questioning whether the accent was intentional or meant to be humorous, but it turned out to be the character’s natural way of speaking, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the book had its charming and funny moments, the distracting male narration impacted my overall enjoyment. The story itself was enjoyable but could have been more immersive with better voice acting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a light, clean, and humorous Hallmark-style novel with a fun premise and engaging female narration.

If this isn’t your preference, the book might not appeal to you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a slow and unengaging start, it ultimately delivered a heartwarming story with a satisfying conclusion. However, the frequent text message conversations and strong Christian themes may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (with the potential for 3.9 if the beginning had been stronger)."

            "The characters face a significant challenge related to someone's job, which is unrelated to Luke's work as a carpenter. The novel effectively ties up loose ends in the lives and relationships of Izzy and Penelope, alongside the men they encountered throughout their journeys.",

While I enjoyed Luke’s story the most, it has also made me curious to revisit Izzy’s tale.",

They are definitely part of a trilogy, which is fantastic.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  In *Loyally, Luke*, we return once again to the small European island country that feels way cooler than Genovia (Sorry, *The Princess Diaries*!).  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I love the chemistry and connection between Luke and Ellie! I’m still processing their relationship, especially considering their different social spheres.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  There’s a big hurdle for them to overcome about someone’s \"job,\" and it has nothing to do with Luke being a carpenter. The novel wraps up some loose ends in the lives and loves of Izzy and Penelope with the fellas they found in their stories.  \n\n- **Personal Preference and Comparison:**  \n  I think I preferred Luke’s story to Penelope’s story, and I sort of want to return to Izzy’s story to see if I still love that one as much as I did when I first discovered the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Loyally, Luke* is a delightful addition to the Skymar series, with engaging character dynamics, a charming setting, and a satisfying resolution to the interconnected stories of Izzy and Penelope. While I enjoyed Luke’s story the most, it has also made me curious to revisit Izzy’s tale.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

He has a memorable encounter with a Princess, who later turns out to be his co-worker on the project.  \n  The story follows Luke’s adventure in Skymar, continuing the journey of the series after *Authentically, Izzy* and *Positively, Penelope*.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Reading Order:**  \n  I think the series is best enjoyed when read in order to fully appreciate this book and Luke’s personality, as well as his dynamic with his sisters.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Satisfaction:**  \n  I really didn’t want this book to end. It was a satisfying conclusion to the series, though I wouldn’t mind if Pepper Basham added a Christmas novella or another book to keep the series alive.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  I appreciated how Luke encouraged the children at the orphanage where he worked, adding depth to his character and the story.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received a copy of this book from the publisher through JustRead Tours. All opinions within this review are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a delightful and satisfying conclusion to the series, with well-developed characters, an engaging plot, and heartfelt moments. While it works best when read in order, it stands as a strong installment that leaves readers wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I adored the sibling dynamics between Luke, Izzy, and Penelope, with Luke standing out as a particularly compelling character. He is protective, kind, resourceful, down-to-earth, clever, witty, and incredibly charming with kids. Ellie's backstory is undeniably tragic, at times bordering on excessive, which can make her feel less relatable. However, her growth and current aspirations to uplift her people and land are commendable. I found her efforts to embrace a normal life rather than a royal one endearing, even if I disagreed with some of her choices. Nevertheless, she took accountability and worked to make amends. The chemistry between Luke and Ellie was delightful; they truly understood and encouraged each other to be their best selves. Their interactions were heartwarming, with a few swoon-worthy kisses that added to the overall charm."

Ellie, on the other hand, has a not-so-great past reputation to overcome and keeps secrets from Luke to feel \"normal\" for once.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  I loved how the story included many cheesy romance book/movie tropes, but Luke pointed out the cheesiness. Even as he fell for Ellie, he acknowledged being a total sap, which added humor and made the story feel more real despite the fairytale-like premise of falling for a secret princess.  \n\n- **Humor and References:**  \n  The references to Hallmark chimes were hilarious, especially with Luke’s sister Penelope constantly bringing them up. The scene where Luke thought he might have to fight a king was particularly funny.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The series is connected by a set of siblings (including Izzy, the cousin adopted as a sibling) and the amazing country of Skymar, which I wish I could visit.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely recommend *Loyally, Luke*, as well as *Authentically, Izzy* and *Positively, Penelope*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Loyally, Luke* is a delightful conclusion to the Skymar series, blending humor, romance, and relatable characters. The self-aware humor and charming setting make it a standout read, and I highly recommend it along with the other books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, it felt a bit too long for its content.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The author did a tremendous job in crafting Penelope, but she ended up being the most annoying character I’ve encountered in a while.  \n\n- **Religious Elements:**  \n  There was a slight mention of God, but it wasn’t off-putting as it often is in other stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a lighthearted, no-spice romance with a well-developed but frustrating main character. While it had some religious undertones, they were handled subtly and didn’t detract from the story. However, the pacing felt drawn out, making the book longer than necessary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story cleverly weaves together beloved movie tropes and numerous references, resulting in a fun and engaging read. Although it is the third book in a series, it stands well on its own, though familiarity with the previous installments may enhance understanding of certain references. The narrative features a charming, clean romantic storyline that is appropriate for teens and even pre-teens, aside from a few mentions of Ellie’s past. However, the official synopsis is somewhat misleading, as it implies a series of letters or emails, while the story is actually conveyed through text messages rather than direct correspondence to the reader.",

Their relationship radiates hope and light, capturing the essence of a soulmate connection.

Luke's interactions with his sisters further illustrate a nurturing family dynamic, as they inspire one another to reach their fullest potential.",

However, I wasn't a fan of the ongoing (albeit clean) physical relationship between Luke and Ellie, especially given that they believed they had no future together and she was being pursued by another man. Additionally, I felt the resolution at the end didn't adequately address Luke's concerns about balancing his family, business, and the challenges of being away for half the year.",

The audio format is very well done, and I would recommend it.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The book was a fun rom-com, with Luke falling into every stereotypical situation that his sisters love and he hates.\n   - I was slightly disappointed that we didn’t get more details about Izzy’s wedding. While I understand this was Luke’s story, I would have liked to spend a little more time on that event.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a strong third installment in the series, and I would definitely recommend reading the previous books before diving into this one. While there were a few minor issues, such as the unresolved reservations about the relationship and the lack of detail about Izzy’s wedding, the book was overall a satisfying and enjoyable read. The Hallmark-style tropes and delightful community of characters made it a fun experience. I also highly recommend the audiobook format.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

His interactions, especially with a little girl named Faye, are incredibly touching and showcase his loyal and giving nature.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ellie):**  \n  Ellie St. Clare initially comes off as snobbish, which naturally rubs Luke the wrong way. However, as the story progresses, she reveals her true nature—kind, caring, and down-to-earth. Her growth and the way she complements Luke’s character are beautifully portrayed.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The first meeting between Luke and Ellie is superbly executed, setting the stage for their evolving relationship. Their love story is tender, heartfelt, and filled with moments that deeply touch the reader.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel beautifully illustrates how a person with a giving heart and unselfish motives can positively influence those around them. It’s a powerful reminder that the world would be a better place if we could all be more like Luke.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is filled with tender moments, particularly between Luke and Faye, that evoke strong emotions. Luke’s humor and loyalty add depth to the narrative, making it both heartwarming and memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a heartfelt and beautifully crafted story with well-developed characters, a touching romance, and meaningful themes. Luke’s character, in particular, stands out as a beacon of kindness and loyalty, making the story unforgettable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
