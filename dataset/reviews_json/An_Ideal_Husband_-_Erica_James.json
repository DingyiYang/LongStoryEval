            "The narrative suffers from an excess of perspectives and subplots, which dilute the focus on the central storyline, resulting in a disjointed and less impactful experience. The resolution feels rushed and overly idealistic, with all conflicts and emotional arcs wrapped up within twelve months, making it seem unrealistic and overly sweet. The novel centers on the breakup of a forty-year marriage and the ensuing emotional fallout within the family. While the premise is intriguing—Kip's announcement on Boxing Day that he intends to leave Louisa for their son’s ex-girlfriend, Zoe—the execution ultimately falls short. The story lacks the expected emotional intensity and depth, particularly in its exploration of Louisa’s journey from security to starting anew.",

Her response to the betrayal—accepting and forgiving—feels too passive, lacking the anger and grief one would typically expect.

While some criticized Louisa’s reaction to her husband’s infidelity, I appreciated the depth of her character and understood her choices. Kip’s vulnerabilities were skillfully portrayed, evoking sympathy for him despite his actions. The book effectively explores family dynamics, particularly how Kip’s choices impact the entire family. The Langfords’ journey through a challenging period of readjustment was heartwarming, and I found myself rooting for them. Angus’s quest to rebuild his relationship with his father after finding happiness in a new romance was especially poignant. Initially, Caro’s push for family reconciliation felt overbearing, but I ultimately came to appreciate her role, making her one of my favorite characters. Her dedication to Peggy’s well-being and her efforts to unite the family were commendable.",

            "The story is overly convoluted, with an excess of dramatic events stemming from the protagonist's poor choices. His drinking problem serves as a recurring catalyst for his infidelity, but rather than providing a meaningful exploration of addiction, it comes across as a superficial excuse. Additionally, the ending, marked by a sudden epiphany, feels unearned and inconsistent with his established character.",
            "The protagonist is deeply flawed, exhibiting a troubling pattern of infidelity and poor decision-making. He cheats on his wife of 40 years with his son’s ex-girlfriend and later betrays his new girlfriend as well. He attributes his actions to a lack of willpower, excessive drinking, and a desire for personal space. Despite recognizing his shortcomings, he rationalizes his behavior as a necessary act of selfishness. His realization at the end—that he feels worse about cheating on his girlfriend than on his wife—implies he never truly loved his wife. The relationships he forms are toxic and self-serving; he abandons his wife, claiming she was too focused on motherhood, and later leaves his girlfriend without confronting his mental health issues, such as panic attacks and therapy. His son’s revelation of his secrets to his girlfriend further complicates matters. Ultimately, the protagonist’s entitlement and lack of accountability undermine all his relationships.",
            "This book delves into themes of selfishness, infidelity, and moral failure. The protagonist's actions and justifications reveal a troubling lack of empathy and accountability. Notably, the narrative often presents his behavior as excusable or understandable, which is both frustrating and unsatisfying."

The narrative attempts to justify his actions, but the execution falls flat, leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. The story’s themes and character development are undermined by poor pacing and inconsistent messaging.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Morality:**  \n   - The protagonist is portrayed as deeply flawed, with a pattern of infidelity and poor decision-making.  \n   - He cheats on his wife of 40 years with his son’s ex-girlfriend, then cheats on his new girlfriend as well.  \n   - He blames his actions on a lack of willpower, excessive alcohol intake, and a desire for \"space.\"  \n   - Despite his self-awareness of being a \"terrible person,\" he justifies his behavior as needing to be \"selfish for once.\"  \n   - His epiphany at the end—that he feels worse about cheating on his girlfriend than on his wife—suggests he never truly loved his wife.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The protagonist’s relationships are toxic and self-serving.  \n   - He abandons his wife, claiming she was too focused on motherhood, and later abandons his girlfriend without addressing his mental health struggles (panic attacks, therapy).  \n   - His son exposes his secrets to his girlfriend, further complicating the relationships.  \n   - The protagonist’s entitlement and lack of accountability strain all his relationships.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n   - The book explores themes of selfishness, infidelity, and moral failure.  \n   - The protagonist’s actions and justifications highlight his lack of empathy and responsibility.  \n   - The narrative seems to suggest that his behavior is excusable or understandable, which is frustrating and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n   - The story is overly convoluted, with too many dramatic events centered around the protagonist’s poor choices.  \n   - The protagonist’s drinking problem is a recurring catalyst for his infidelity, but it feels like a shallow excuse rather than a meaningful exploration of addiction.  \n   - The ending, with his sudden epiphany, feels unearned and inconsistent with his character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book revolves around a deeply unlikable protagonist whose repeated infidelity and selfishness make it difficult to empathize with or root for him. The narrative attempts to justify his actions, but the execution falls flat, leaving the reader frustrated and unsatisfied. The story’s themes and character development are undermined by poor pacing and inconsistent messaging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The reviewer clearly disliked the book, as evidenced by their harsh critique and metaphorical comparison of the story to a \"turd wrapped in a candy wrapper.\" No specific numerical rating is provided, but the tone suggests a very low score."

The central conflict occurs when Kip asks for a divorce on Boxing Day, leading to emotional turmoil and fractured relationships. Told from multiple perspectives, the narrative seeks to provide insights into each character's viewpoint. However, this approach leads to significant repetition, causing me to skip pages without losing track of the plot. The story feels overly lengthy, and the pacing could be tightened to enhance engagement. The ending is both unbelievable and unsatisfying, ultimately diminishing the overall impact of the narrative.",

The tone is engaging, and the story maintains a strong emotional pull throughout most of the book.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The final chapters, however, fall short. The resolution, which suggests a level of harmony among the family members in less than 12 months, feels entirely unrealistic. This abrupt and unconvincing ending detracts from the overall quality of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in exploring emotional conflicts and character dynamics, the unrealistic and rushed ending undermines its impact. Despite this flaw, it remains an engaging and thought-provoking read for most of its duration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars for the majority of the book, but the ending reduces the overall rating.  \n\n**Note:**  \nI received a free copy of this novel from NetGalley in return for an honest review."

It provided a light and undemanding experience, which was exactly what I needed at the time.  \n\n- **Character Development and Resolution:**  \n  The story featured a host of characters who all lived happily ever after, though their outcomes felt super unlikely. While the happy endings were satisfying, they lacked depth and realism, making the resolutions feel somewhat contrived.  \n\n- **Writing and Dialogue Quality:**  \n  The writing and dialogue could have been sharper. The way characters spoke to each other felt unnatural, as if no one really talks like that in real life. This detracted from the overall believability of the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Realism:**  \n  The novel missed an opportunity to explore deeper emotional complexities. For instance, at the end of a year when a 40-year marriage has been severed without notice, there would likely be more hurt, damage, and visible scars to navigate. The story glossed over these nuances, making it feel less authentic.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Authors:**  \n  Authors like Ann Pratchett or Anne Tyler handle similar themes with much greater skill and depth. Their ability to weave emotional complexity and realism into their stories sets a higher standard that this novel did not meet.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel served its purpose as an easy and predictable read during my recovery, it fell short in several areas. The writing and dialogue lacked sharpness, the character resolutions felt unrealistic, and the emotional depth was insufficient.

I felt for her when Kip told her he was leaving, and I was glad she grew stronger and came to terms with the situation.  \n  - Kip was portrayed as a jerk—shallow, self-centered, and cowardly. He always wanted things on his terms, which made him unlikable.  \n  - I also felt sympathy for Zoe, the other woman, at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story effectively explores how the events affected the entire family and how they found a way to move forward.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  - The author has a talent for creating memorable characters, which is consistent across her other works.  \n\n- **Personal Impact:**  \n  - Even though I read this book a while ago and have read many others since, the characters stayed with me, which speaks to the story’s lasting impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel and found the characters and their journeys compelling. The story’s exploration of family dynamics and personal growth left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI was torn between a four or five-star rating, but the memorable characters and emotional depth ultimately make it a strong contender for five stars."
