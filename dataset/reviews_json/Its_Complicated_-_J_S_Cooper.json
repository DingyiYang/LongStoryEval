            "While I enjoyed the beginning of the book, the latter half felt rushed and leaned too heavily into the trope of instant love, which didn't resonate with me. The story centers on Lori, who has harbored a crush on her best friend Aiden since college. Aiden embodies the perfect nice guy, while Lori’s other best friend, Jace, presents a bad boy exterior. When Aiden's wedding invitation arrives, Lori and Jace concoct a plan for a fake dating relationship leading up to the big day. The premise has a charming 90s rom-com vibe, reminiscent of *My Best Friend's Wedding*.",
            "The chemistry between Lori and Jace was captivating, complemented by lighthearted moments reminiscent of classic rom-coms. I was initially concerned about a potential love triangle, but the book skillfully sidestepped this trope, which I appreciated."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this book had a promising start with its rom-com vibes and strong character chemistry, but the rushed ending and overuse of pop culture references detracted from my enjoyment. It’s a decent read for fans of closed-door romance, but it didn’t fully work for me.",

His poor communication skills and misinterpretations often left him sulking, but I felt sympathy for him due to his 15 years of unrequited love. **Aiden:** Though not a main character, Aiden deserves recognition for his patience and his ability to harmonize the group.

His lack of communication and tendency to misinterpret situations made him sulk, but I sympathized with him given his 15 years of unrequited love.  \n  - **Aiden:** Though not a main character, he deserves recognition for his patience and ability to balance the group.

The characters were mature (with Lori being a slight exception), and everything resolved well because of their maturity. I was relieved there was no \"other woman\" trope, as I initially worried about a side character who turned out to be non-threatening.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The pop culture references, particularly to Taylor Swift songs, irked me a bit. While I enjoy her music, using her songs in the book, especially to end the story, felt like it took attention away from the plot. It seemed as though the author relied on these references to save the ending, which might alienate readers who aren’t fans.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved the story! It was a light and quick read, and I’d recommend it to fans of long unrequited love, golden retriever-type guys, fake dating, college best friends, and closed-door romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some initial reservations about the characters and the use of pop culture references, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was a refreshing take on romance with mature characters and a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n💎 (Note: The review does not explicitly mention a numerical or star rating, but the diamond emoji likely signifies a positive rating.)  \n\n💎 Thank you, Netgalley and Boldwood Books, for the eARC.

They hadn't truly known each other in a domestic sense or discussed practical aspects of their future, such as where they would live.

While the plot had great potential, the characters' actions and decisions often frustrated me, detracting from my overall enjoyment.",

It had potential for 4 stars, but certain elements held it back.\n\n- **Ending and Plot Resolution:**  \n  The ending was disappointing. The decision for the characters to get married so quickly felt unrealistic. They hadn’t known each other in a domestic sense or planned practical aspects of their future together, like where they would live. This lack of depth in their relationship made the ending feel rushed and unconvincing.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The male lead’s lack of protectiveness and his comfort with the female lead’s close relationship with her male best friend was baffling. He even admitted he would have holed up with her, which felt inconsistent with his character and their relationship dynamics.\n\n- **Character Development (Female Lead):**  \n  The female lead came across as a “pick me” character, especially when she claimed she was friends with guys because they were “less drama.” The entire book seemed to challenge this notion, showing that men could be just as dramatic, but her growth or realization on this front felt lacking.\n\n- **Overall Plot and Execution:**  \n  The plot itself was great and had potential, but the characters’ actions and decisions often frustrated me, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong plot, the rushed ending, unrealistic character decisions, and lack of depth in relationships held it back from being a higher-rated read. The characters’ behaviors, particularly the female lead’s “pick me” attitude and the male lead’s lack of protectiveness, were major drawbacks. Despite these issues, the story had its merits, earning it a 3-star rating.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

It included a trio of doctor friends, a friends-to-lovers trope, fake dating, the maid of honor and best man dynamic, dual points of view, and a closed-door romance (or what I like to call \"fade to black\").  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved the novel. Despite a slightly abrupt ending, the execution of the clichés, the engaging narration, and the well-crafted tropes made it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10"

Her books are so addictive that putting them down is impossible because the story simply flows without you even noticing.  \n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The book includes several engaging tropes: friends to lovers, fake dating, love triangle, dual POV, and fade to black. I usually stay away from love triangles, as it's not a trope I typically enjoy, but this one wasn't painful to read at all.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were fun to read and get to know. Jace, our MMC, won me over rather quickly. He was sweet, caring, and a great friend who loves fiercely, which I adored. Lori, our FMC, was fun but a bit annoying at times, especially in the beginning. Her \"I'm-not-like-the-other-girls\" attitude felt too forceful, coming across as arrogant, obnoxious, and even mean at times. However, this improved as the story progressed.  \n- **Depth and Context:**  \n  I felt the characters lacked depth. We learn a bit about their history but not much about their families or broader context, especially Lori's.  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The second half of the book felt a bit rushed, and Lori's side of the romance leaned into insta-love territory.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these flaws, I enjoyed this book a lot. It was super fun and sweet, with a happy ending. If you're looking for a romcom with a super sweet romance, this is the book for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some minor flaws, such as rushed pacing and a lack of depth in character backstories, it was an enjoyable and addictive read. The engaging tropes, fun characters, and sweet romance made it a delightful romcom with a satisfying happy ending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5  \n\nThank you so much to the publisher and Camilla Isley for the eARC in exchange for an honest review.

            "Isley's ability to convey the characters' emotions is truly remarkable. I appreciated Lori's goofiness—it's refreshing compared to typical perfect protagonists! However, I found some of Aiden's character traits were more told than shown, which made it harder to connect with him. The dynamic among the three friends didn't quite resonate as “the three amigos,” and the interactions between Aiden and Lori felt less organic than I would have liked. While I understood their underlying romantic tension, they didn’t seem to act like best friends from college. On the other hand, Jace and Lori's dynamic was fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed their story.",

Her decision to enter a fake relationship with her best friend, Jace, in a bid to capture Aiden's attention was both compelling and relatable. Jace and Aiden are both strikingly handsome and genuinely value their friendship with Lori, which made it surprising that she had never considered Jace as a romantic option despite their years of friendship. Their shared workplace added humor and provided plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. While the fake relationship sizzled with tension, neither Lori nor Jace acted on their growing feelings, with Jace, in particular, embodying the perfect gentleman by consistently avoiding opportunities to take advantage of the situation.",

It’s a complicated but engaging story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Lori is scatty and lovable, and I immediately connected with her, especially because of her love for rescuing books, which I relate to.  \n  - Jace is endearing, and his secret love for Lori adds depth to his character.  \n  - The miscommunication trope involving the characters, who are nearing or in their 30s, felt frustrating. They should have just talked things out instead of dragging out the drama.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The writing is engaging and humorous, with a lighthearted tone that makes the story enjoyable.  \n  - The use of quirky elements like garden gnomes, rescued books, and animals adds charm to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - The story moves at a good pace, with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.  \n  - The inclusion of various subplots, like the trip to New Orleans and the bridesmaid’s interest in Jace, adds complexity without overwhelming the reader.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI absolutely loved this book! The characters are relatable and endearing, and the story is filled with humor, heart, and a touch of chaos. While the miscommunication trope was a bit frustrating, the overall charm of the book made it a delightful read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "This novel beautifully incorporates my favorite tropes: friends-to-lovers, unrequited love, and plenty of pining, all of which intensify as Lori and Jace embark on a fake-dating journey. While the fake-dating premise leads to genuine feelings, the mounting lies ultimately create confusion for Lori. Unfortunately, the ending feels rushed and forced, with Jace and Lori marrying unexpectedly during Aidan’s wedding—an unnecessary twist that detracts from the main event. Although the story is predictable, it remains enjoyable, particularly for rom-com enthusiasts. However, the abrupt conclusion leaves much to be desired, overshadowing Aidan's special day.",

However, Lori often comes off as a “pick me” girl, lamenting her quirks and disinterest in makeup, which can be grating. Other characters, like Aidan, feel underdeveloped; it’s unclear why Lori has loved him for 15 years, and there’s little depth to anyone outside the main trio. The pact between Jace and Aidan to never pursue Lori adds complexity to their friendship and Jace’s feelings. However, Jace and Lori’s relationship seems overly dependent, lacking evidence of their individual lives. Additionally, the absence of explanations for nicknames like “Lola” and “Aidanberry” misses an opportunity to enrich their backstory.",

            "The premise of Lori and Jace pretending to be in a relationship after being caught together is intriguing. However, the revelation of Aiden and Jace's pact not to date Lori feels contrived and adds unnecessary drama. The resolution, where Aiden reconciles the situation and Lori acknowledges her love for Jace, is satisfying, though the miscommunication surrounding Jace’s disappearance is frustrating.",
            "I found it hard to believe that Lori, a successful doctor, could harbor an unrequited crush on Aiden for 15 years. This felt unrealistic and somewhat juvenile for such mature characters. However, I appreciated the emotional depth, particularly in Jace, who grappled with his feelings and went missing, mistakenly believing Lori and Aiden were together. While I’m not a fan of second-chance romances or closed-door love stories, the author’s writing and the swoon-worthy moments made the book enjoyable. Although I typically don’t like insta-love, my love for romance shone through, and this book delivered on that front.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Camila Isalys' writing style. She skillfully creates vivid imagery and enhances the humor, making the funny moments even more enjoyable. The humor and the satisfying ending were standout elements for me, making the book worthwhile despite some plot issues."

            "The novel *It’s Complicated* is a revamped version of *Falling for Your Best Friend*, intertwining friends-to-lovers, fake-dating, and love triangle tropes. The story follows Dr. Lori Archibald, who has secretly loved her best friend and medical partner, Aiden, since college. When Aiden announces his engagement, Lori, panicking, turns to her other best friend, Jace, who steps in as her fake boyfriend for the wedding.",
            "In this engaging story, 33-year-old Lori views herself as an unattractive nerd, prioritizing her passion for rescuing stray animals and books over her appearance. She struggles with female friendships and feels out of place. Aiden, her charming blond friend, is engaged to the sophisticated Kirsten, while Jace, Lori’s other best friend, is a tall, brooding ladies’ man who has secretly loved her for years. Jace's neat-freak, type-A personality contrasts sharply with Lori's carefree nature, creating a compelling dynamic among the trio. Notably, there is no clear antagonist; Aiden and Jace made a pact in college to avoid romantic involvement with Lori to protect their friendship. When Jace finally confesses his feelings, Lori faces a pivotal choice between him and Aiden, adding depth to the narrative.",

            "My primary issue with the story is that Lori has been in love with Aiden for 15 years, yet after just one kiss from her fake boyfriend and true best friend, Jace, she suddenly starts falling for him instead. This shift feels unconvincing. Moreover, the ending felt rushed and I struggled to support Lori and Jace's impulsive decision. It seemed out of character for two people who took over a decade to navigate their relationship.",
            "Lori's swift shift to Jace portrayed her as a weak, indecisive character, undermining the sincerity of her feelings. Additionally, I found it hard to accept Jace as a \"bad boy\"; dating a few women over 15 years hardly qualifies him as such.",
            "I’m not a fan of closed-door romance, and the strong quirky cat-lady vibe—complete with rescue chickens—didn't resonate with me. While I appreciate Taylor Swift, I felt that her music and cultural presence were overused as a theme. Additionally, I found the concept of rescuing books inconsistent: if you're passionate about saving them, why not buy the physical copies you truly want instead of opting for digital versions? Bringing home books you have no intention of reading just doesn’t make sense to me.",

It just wasn't for me.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I felt like Lori's quick pivot to Jace made her seem like a weak, wishy-washy character and made her feelings seem insincere. I didn't buy poor Jace as a \"bad boy\" either. Dating a few different women in 15 years does not a bad boy make.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  My main problem with the story is that Lori has been in love with Aiden for 15 YEARS and suddenly after one kiss from \"fake boyfriend\"/real best friend Jace, she is falling out of love with Aiden and catches some serious feelings for Jace. I don't buy it. The ending seemed very rushed as well. I was not on board with Lori and Jace's impulsive decision at the end. It seemed out of character for a pair of people who took 15+ years to figure out their relationship.\n\n- **Themes and Motifs:**  \n  I don't love closed-door romance, I also didn't resonate with the strong quirky cat-lady vibe [never mind the rescue chickens], and I like Taylor Swift just fine but I think as a theme Taylor's music and general zeitgeist is/was overused. Furthermore, I found the \"rescue books\" perplexing: if you want to save books so much, why don't you BUY the ones you want instead of purchasing digital copies? Why bring home physical copies of books you don't actually want to read...? I don't get it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDon't get me wrong, it's a cute story, and I'm sure it will hit the spot for a lot of readers.

Lori has harbored secret feelings for Aiden since their first year, while Jace has secretly loved Lori for just as long. The plot intensifies with the arrival of Aiden's wedding invitation, prompting Lori to face her emotions and Jace to reassess his feelings. Their decision to enter into a fake relationship leads to unforeseen complications and genuine emotions.

Her obsession with collecting cats and hens was cute and heartwarming, but she didn’t strike me as sorted or mature, much less capable of handling sick patients. She reminded me of Becky from the *Shopaholic* series by Sophie Kinsella—both women with big hearts and many feelings, which made me fall in love with her character.  \n  - **Aiden and Jace:** They had some great conversations, and I ADORE how considerate and supportive Aiden is as a friend, irrespective of the circumstances. He’s the loyal bestie everyone dreams of.  \n  - **Dialogue:** I didn’t like the repeated use of “man” and “bro” in the dude talk—it got annoying.\n- **Ending:** I didn’t like the ending. It came as a surprise and felt unbelievable given the circumstances.\n- **Writing Style:** Isley’s writing style is highly entertaining and enjoyable, which is why I’m going to keep reading her books.\n- **Emotional and Humorous Moments:** There are a ton of scenes in the novel that made me smile, whether it was goofy Lori or some emotional bits that I loved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I found the book to be a light, entertaining read with some heartwarming and humorous moments, it lacked depth and the ending felt unrealistic.

For instance, the protagonist, who is a vegetarian, prefers to pretend she's eating chicken rather than simply asking for another plate, which felt like a missed opportunity for growth. While her altruistic tendencies—like saving animals and rescuing unsold books—are emphasized, her contradictory actions, such as taking long showers, distract from the narrative. The introduction of a clichéd \"girly-girl\" character who wants to steal her man felt uninspired; she falls squarely into the \"I'm-not-like-other-girls\" trope, insisting that friendships with guys are less dramatic. Although the protagonist's quirks—such as trying to make her cats vegetarian and hoarding books to the point of blocking her coat closet—are meant to add depth, they instead make her seem inconsistent and hard to relate to.

While the initial premise involves a love triangle (Lori has always been in love with her best friend Aiden), the story takes a different direction as Aiden is getting married.  \n  - The fake dating trope and friends-to-lovers dynamic between Lori and Jace are executed well and tick almost all the boxes for me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - Lori and Jace’s relationship develops quickly, which I found slightly unrealistic, though it’s revealed that Jace has been in love with Lori for a long time.  \n  - I appreciated that Lori and Aiden never explored a romantic relationship, as it kept the story focused and avoided unnecessary complications.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Intimacy:**  \n  - The buildup to intimate moments is filled with tension and fire, but the scenes themselves are closed-door, which didn’t fully align with my preference for more spice.  \n  - The third-act breakup felt unnecessary and overly dramatic, especially since the misunderstanding could have been resolved with a simple conversation.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Writing Style:**  \n  - The book is highly entertaining, with likable characters and a compelling storyline.  \n  - I’m a fan of Camilla Isley’s writing and appreciate her Swiftie references, which made the book even more enjoyable for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a refreshing take on romance tropes, with a well-executed fake dating and friends-to-lovers storyline. While I had some reservations about the pacing of the relationship and the lack of spice, the overall entertainment value and likable characters made it a worthwhile read. I’m always eager to read more from Camilla Isley.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "This book is fast-paced and easy to read, making it an enjoyable experience.

Lori’s indecisiveness made the story exhausting at times, leaving me feeling as if she was unfairly stringing Jace along. While Aiden embodies the \"perfect man\" in Lori's eyes, I found him rather dull and struggled to see his appeal. In contrast, Jace has a swoon-worthy charm, though his flaws occasionally annoyed me.

            "Lori’s feelings for Aiden extend over 15 years, making it hard to believe she could change her mind after just one month with Jace. Her portrayal of Kirsten as unlikable seems unjust, especially since Kirsten consistently displays kindness in their interactions. Lori’s bias is evident when she describes Kirsten as an outsider disrupting their “balanced ecosystem,” a balance that is inherently flawed due to Lori’s unrequited love for Aiden. \n\nLori's character is further illuminated by her admission of having few female friends and preferring male friendships, which she views as simpler. Her relationship with Jace comes off as rushed and unconvincing, particularly given her long-standing feelings for Aiden. While Jace’s unrequited love for Lori adds depth to his character, his role as her emotional support feels underdeveloped. \n\nThe tension between Lori and Kirsten is one-sided; Lori unfairly judges Kirsten, who remains accommodating and kind. Lori's struggle to connect with other women and her reliance on male friendships ultimately highlight her emotional immaturity and lack of self-awareness."

            "The book is marketed as featuring a love triangle, but this aspect plays a minor role in the overall narrative. While the story is fast-paced and easy to read, it may become predictable. The final quarter felt rushed and unrealistic, featuring a third-act breakup, miscommunication between Jace and Lori, and Jace's decision to flee rather than confront the issues directly. Aiden’s involvement in resolving the conflicts introduced unnecessary complexity. Although the majority of the book was enjoyable, the pacing faltered towards the end, and the hurried resolution detracted from the overall experience.",
            "The characters in the story are all likable. Lori, with her passion for cats, hens, and rescuing books, is particularly endearing. Jace's patience and willingness to listen to Lori's admiration for Aiden, despite his own feelings for her, make him a compelling character. Aiden is understanding, and their mutual friend adds an adorable dynamic to the group.",

Lori was portrayed as a terrible friend who used Jace for 15 years without ever truly knowing him. Aiden was a one-dimensional character, and there was no depth to explain why Lori liked him so much. Kirsten and Lori’s potential friendship was never explored, and Lori was depicted as evil without a justifiable redemption arc.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure (Dual POV):**  \n  Despite using dual POV, the narrative failed to provide deeper insights into the characters, leaving them underdeveloped and unrelatable.  \n\n- **Professional Portrayal:**  \n  The portrayal of the characters as doctors who own their own practice was unconvincing. They did not seem qualified or competent, and many elements felt written purely for convenience.  \n\n- **Lori’s Personality:**  \n  Lori’s “pick me” attitude was exhausting and unlikable, making it difficult to connect with her character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a letdown. The plot, character development, and narrative structure were all poorly executed, and the characters felt unrealistic and unrelatable.

Additionally, I prefer epilogues that take us further into the future beyond the last chapter. The ending left me feeling incomplete and unsatisfied.",

The other characters, despite being in their 30s, often acted like they were only 16, which felt off.

It was engaging and kept me hooked, as I read it in about 5 hours.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  My biggest issue was that the ending, although good, felt very rushed. I feel there almost could have been a second book because I still have so many unanswered questions. Additionally, the entire book is written over a 1-month span of story time, so there’s a lot of detail that could have been explored if the author had stretched the timeline a bit longer.  \n\n- **Accuracy and Attention to Detail:**  \n  A minor but noticeable annoyance was the inaccuracy in describing one of the main characters driving a Tesla. The author mentioned her “turning on the engine,” which a Tesla does not have. This felt like a lack of knowledge on the subject and took me out of the story momentarily.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Readability:**  \n  Despite these issues, it was a good book and an easy read.

The tension between Jace and Lori was expertly crafted, making it one of my favorite friends-to-lovers and fake-dating plots. However, the second half felt rushed and leaned too heavily into instant love, which felt abrupt. The pacing was a significant issue; I believe that adding another 100 pages could have greatly enhanced the story."

The ending lacks logical coherence, particularly with Jace and Lori getting married after a brief relationship, especially given Lori's abrupt shift from loving their best friend for 15 years. Additionally, their decision to marry during their best friend's wedding is confusing and poorly justified. While the romantic interactions are subtle, they fail to fully convince. Lori's sudden willingness to marry Jace, despite her long-standing feelings for Aiden, comes across as forced and implausible.",

However, the third-act breakup feels unnecessary and rushed, quickly resolved by a secret wedding at Aiden’s ceremony.

As Lori’s feelings for Aiden quickly diminish, she discovers her attraction to Jace. Taking time to reflect on her emotions, she demonstrates maturity and consideration for Jace's feelings. When Jace confesses his love for Lori, he suggests proceeding slowly, which I found commendable. Their chemistry is palpable, marked by moments of tension and tenderness.

Jace, another pivotal character, shines with his patience and understanding. He refrains from pressuring Lori into a relationship, offering her support during her emotional turmoil, which I found profoundly moving.",
