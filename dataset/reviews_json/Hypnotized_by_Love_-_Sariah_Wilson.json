            "The story begins with a captivating premise, especially through the hypnotherapy aspect, and the initial third excels with an engaging enemy-to-lovers dynamic. Unfortunately, the plot loses its momentum and charm in the second half, diminishing the overall enjoyment. The central conflict, which explains the years of silence between the FMC and MMC, feels implausible and lacks depth, making the ensuing drama seem contrived and ultimately undermining the story's potential.",
            "The characters exhibited a level of immaturity that made their actions and decisions feel more appropriate for teenagers than adults, which was frustrating and detracted from the overall story. While the initial chemistry between them was engaging, it diminished as the narrative unfolded. This lack of believable chemistry in the latter part of the book resulted in a romance that felt forced."

The immature characters, lack of believable chemistry, and contrived drama significantly detracted from the story.

Despite being 24 and having a serious career, her behavior often resembles that of a high school student, which makes it difficult to connect with her as a protagonist.

I’ve always had a fondness for identical twins, and I appreciated how Sierra supported her sister throughout the book.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Use of Miscommunication Trope:**  \n   - I don’t usually mind the miscommunication trope if it serves the plot, but in this book, it was overused. There were at least four instances of miscommunication drama, which became exhausting, especially toward the end.  \n\n- **Character Development (Female Main Character):**  \n   - Savannah, the female main character, was overly emotional, which felt out of character for someone who is a therapist. Her emotions led her to jump to conclusions repeatedly, making her actions frustrating and hard to relate to.  \n\n- **Plot Execution and Concept:**  \n   - The concept of the story was cute, but it felt underdeveloped. I wish there had been more focus on hypnosis, as it was a unique aspect of the plot. Additionally, the story lacked depth and fell flat overall.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements and Spice Level:**  \n   - The romance was lacking in spice, which was disappointing. I expected more tension and chemistry, especially given the enemies-to-lovers trope.  \n\n- **Author and Initial Expectations:**  \n   - I picked up this book because I enjoyed a novella by the same author earlier this year and wanted to explore more of her work. Unfortunately, this book didn’t meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of *Hypnotized by Love* had potential, the execution fell short. The overuse of miscommunication, underdeveloped plot, and frustrating main character made it a disappointing read. The lack of spice and depth in the romance further contributed to my overall dissatisfaction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: 3/5 ⭐⭐⭐  \n- Spice Level: 2/5 🌶🌶"

Years later, Savannah has become a hypnotherapist, while Mason returns to town following the failure of his latest book. Hired to write an exposé on her as a \"fake\" hypnotist, he secretly schedules an appointment with her. This narrative beautifully navigates a second-chance romance, evolving from childhood friends to enemies and, ultimately, to something deeper.",

While their initial breakup rationale appears trivial, deeper revelations later in the story intensify their conflict.

            "Savannah, a professional hypnotherapist, comes across as immature and overly dramatic, making her character frustrating to engage with. Her six-year grudge against Mason seems weak and disproportionate to her intense feelings, further highlighting her flaws. In contrast, Mason is charming, patient, and likable, providing a refreshing balance to Savannah's character. The romance leans toward the squeaky-clean side, lacking spice, which may appeal to some readers. However, the reliance on the overused miscommunication trope and Savannah's exaggerated reactions diminish overall enjoyment. The witty banter and clever one-liners between the characters stand out as delightful highlights, adding charm to the story.",

The premise is both cute and intriguing, particularly when Savannah and Mason's hypnotherapy session takes an unexpected turn, making Mason more suggestible. However, the hypnotherapy angle quickly recedes as Savannah's personal issues and her tendency to hold grudges take center stage."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel features a unique twist on the RomCom genre with its focus on hypnotherapy, blending the teenage friends-to-almost-lovers trope with enemies-to-lovers dynamics. The premise is cute and intriguing, especially with the hypnotherapy session between Savannah and Mason going awry, leaving Mason more suggestible. However, the hypnotherapy aspect quickly fades into the background, overshadowed by Savannah's personal baggage and her tendency to hold grudges.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Savannah, the protagonist, is a professional hypnotherapist but comes across as immature and overly dramatic. Her six-year grudge against Mason feels weak and disproportionate to the intensity of her hatred, making her a frustrating character. Mason, on the other hand, is portrayed as hunky, patient, and likable, serving as a counterbalance to Savannah's flaws.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  The romance is almost squeaky-clean, with very little spice, which may appeal to some readers. However, the overused miscommunication trope and Savannah's over-the-top reactions detract from the overall enjoyment. The banter and one-liners between the characters are highlights, adding charm to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel touches on important themes such as forgiveness, family, friendship, and the effects of self-sabotage. These elements add depth to the story and provide meaningful takeaways for readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a unique premise and some charming moments, it is hindered by Savannah's frustrating character and the reliance on overused tropes like miscommunication. The story's strengths lie in its witty banter, Mason's likable personality, and its exploration of meaningful themes. Overall, it’s a cute read if you can overlook its flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 STARS  \n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nI received a digital copy of this book as part of the Amazon First Reads program. All opinions are my own."

This plot twist felt contrived and only added to my frustration with the story.",

Savannah, in her mid-twenties, often acted more like a teenager, which made it difficult to connect with her. Her lack of personal growth was particularly evident when she repeated the same mistake near the end as she did at the beginning. In contrast, I found Savannah's twin sister, Sierra, to be a compelling character. The unconditional love between the sisters created a beautiful dynamic as Sierra attempted to guide Savannah through her struggles, adding depth to their relationship and making Sierra a standout presence in the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Protagonist):**  \n   - I nearly gave up on this book after the first handful of chapters because I was so frustrated with the protagonist's poor decisions.  \n   - Savannah, the protagonist, felt very immature for someone in her mid-twenties. Her behavior throughout the book made her seem more like a teenager than an adult.  \n   - It was especially frustrating when she repeated the same mistake near the end of the book that she made at the start, showing zero personal growth until the very end.  \n\n- **Plot and Ethical Concerns:**  \n   - The premise of Savannah hypnotizing her teenage crush as part of a journalistic investigation felt ethically questionable. I couldn't help but think about the codes of ethics that were being ignored.  \n   - The situation escalated when a fire alarm interrupted the hypnosis, leaving Savannah to trail after her crush until he came out of the trance. This plot point felt contrived and added to my frustration.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - I really liked Savannah's twin sister, Sierra. The unconditional love between the two sisters was a lovely dynamic to see.  \n   - Sierra tried to guide Savannah out of her nonsense, which added a layer of depth to their relationship and made Sierra a standout character.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - Despite my initial frustrations, I did get drawn into the story a bit later on, which kept me reading until the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the protagonist's immaturity and questionable decisions made the book frustrating at times, the strong sibling relationship between Savannah and Sierra, along with the eventual engagement with the story, provided some redeeming qualities. The ethical concerns in the plot and the lack of character growth were significant drawbacks, but the story managed to hold my interest enough to finish it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up."

            "This novel presents a second-chance romance between childhood rivals Savannah and Mason. Savannah, a hypnotherapist, finds her career at risk due to a disgruntled patient, putting her on probation. Meanwhile, Mason, a struggling writer, returns to his hometown to explore the legitimacy of hypnosis and seeks Savannah's assistance. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falters, with around 60% of the narrative feeling like missed opportunities. The pacing is uneven, causing the story to lose momentum after the initial setup. Additionally, the conflict between Savannah and Mason could have been resolved more swiftly, rendering the miscommunication trope prolonged and somewhat tedious.",
            "Savannah and Mason share undeniable chemistry, and their witty banter is both humorous and engaging. However, the miscommunication that arises between them, while a common trope in romance novels, feels somewhat overused in this story.",
            "The novel highlights the dangers of false allegations and the skepticism surrounding hypnosis, but these important themes are not sufficiently explored. The hypnotherapy, which initially appears central to the narrative, quickly recedes after the first session, resulting in a missed opportunity for deeper engagement with the topic."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While *Hypnotized by Love* has an interesting premise and strong chemistry between the main characters, it falls short in fully exploring its themes and maintaining consistent pacing. The miscommunication trope and the underutilization of the hypnotherapy angle detract from the overall enjoyment. Despite these flaws, the humor and banter between Savannah and Mason make it a light, entertaining read.",

            "The pacing of the story felt somewhat rushed, particularly regarding the rapid development of the romance and the resolution of Mason's suggestibility. A slower burn could have amplified the emotional stakes and made the narrative more engaging. While the plot is light and accessible, it lacks the depth and character connection necessary to create a lasting impact. Centered around Savannah, a hypnotherapist, and Mason, her high school crush turned nemesis who returns as her client, the story explores themes of love, self-discovery, and healing past wounds. The incorporation of hypnotherapy and Mason's suggestibility adds an intriguing element to the plot, but a more in-depth exploration of his suggestibility could have introduced greater tension and excitement.",

            "This novel, marketed as a rom-com with hypnosis at its core, quickly transforms into a poignant second-chance romance between Savannah and Mason. The exploration of hypnosis is both sensitive and realistic, serving as a pivotal catalyst for Mason’s personal growth and his reconnection with Savannah. The narrative delves into serious issues such as eating disorders, grooming, sexual abuse, and parental illness, adding significant depth to the story. At 279 pages, the novel maintains a brisk pace without unnecessary filler, although some readers may desire a deeper exploration of these serious themes. While the pacing keeps the story engaging, a final miscommunication near the end feels somewhat frustrating and contrived.",
            "Savannah is a complex protagonist grappling with trust issues and a tendency to self-sabotage, which can be frustrating at times. In contrast, Mason is a charming and self-aware romantic hero who challenges Savannah while supporting her growth. Savannah’s twin sister, Sierra, adds depth to the story as a well-developed side character, offering both support and tough love. The palpable chemistry between Savannah and Mason is highlighted through their dates, moments of bonding, and candid conversations, driving the romance forward. The novel skillfully balances sweet and sexy moments without explicit scenes, maintaining a clean and wholesome tone while effectively conveying sexual tension.",
            "The novel is misrepresented as a lighthearted rom-com filled with hypnosis antics, when in reality, it is a profound second-chance romance. The “clean and wholesome” label is misleading; while the story lacks religious overtones, it still adopts a closed-door approach to intimacy."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite some frustrations with Savannah’s character and the misleading marketing, *Hypnotized by Love* is a genuinely sweet and fun romance with strong chemistry, well-developed characters, and a thoughtful exploration of serious themes. The novel’s quick pacing and emotional depth make it an enjoyable read, and I look forward to exploring more works by this author.",

The last romance books I read were Barbara Taylor Bradford’s Emma Harte series, which I picked up because of the TV adaptation and my admiration for Jenny Seagrove. That was a long time ago.\n\n- **Initial Interest and Hook:**\n   - The word “hypnotized” in the title caught my attention, as I’ve been fascinated by the topic for years, partly due to its frequent use as a trope in TV shows and movies. As a writer, I also find it intriguing as a plot device.\n\n- **Plot and Characters:**\n   - The story revolves around Savannah Sinclair, a fledgling hypnotherapist who is unjustly accused of improprieties by a client. She must tread carefully to avoid losing her license. The return of her long-time flame, Mason Beckett, a struggling novelist, adds complexity to her life. Savannah has a twin sister, Sierra, and a dog-toting friend, Bridget, both of whom play central roles in the story.\n\n- **Conflict and Development:**\n   - Mason, a skeptic of hypnotherapy, seeks Savannah’s help for an article he’s writing. Despite her reservations, Savannah hypnotizes him, and he enters a suggestible state. She plants the suggestion that he should say “yes” more often, which leads to unexpected consequences. Savannah feels responsible and decides to monitor Mason until the suggestion wears off.\n\n- **Engagement and Appeal:**\n   - The story becomes very interesting at this point, even for someone like me who doesn’t typically care for hypnosis. The non-tropey potential of the situation kept me engaged. The detailed descriptions of Savannah’s emotions and physical reactions, while extensive, felt authentic and relatable, reminding me of the intensity of young love and desire.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book was far better than I expected. Despite my initial reservations about the romance genre, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. The story brought a smile to my face, and I believe it could do the same for others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n“Hypnotized By Love” exceeded my expectations.

            "At first, the female main character (FMC) appears immature, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that her behavior is rooted in a painful rumor she believes was spread by the male main character (MMC). Having faced similar harassment in my own life, I empathize with her need for self-protection and her distrust of others. This does not reflect immaturity; it illustrates her humanity. By the end of the book, the FMC demonstrates significant personal growth. The MMC is a standout character, showing the FMC patience and grace—qualities essential for someone navigating past trauma. He handles challenging situations effectively, even when she reacts unpredictably.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n   - This was a random choice to listen to off Kindle Unlimited, and I’m glad I did.  \n   - I found this book to be entertaining, which is something I often say about books. I’m easily entertained, and this one worked for me.  \n   - Overall, I thought this book was sweet and a fun listen.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The FMC (female main character) initially comes off as immature, but as the story progresses, you learn her behavior stems from a deeply hurtful rumor she believes the MMC (male main character) started.  \n   - Having experienced similar harassment in my own life, I understand her need to protect herself and her distrust of others. This doesn’t make her immature; it makes her human.  \n   - By the end of the book, I felt the FMC showed significant growth.  \n   - The MMC was great—he showed the FMC patience and grace, which is essential for someone dealing with past trauma. He handled difficult situations well, even when she reacted irrationally.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story revolves around a second-chance romance, friends-to-enemies-to-lovers, and features no spice—just lots of flirting and kissing.  \n   - The themes of overcoming past hurt, rebuilding trust, and personal growth resonated with me.  \n\n- **Reader Reception and Comparison:**  \n   - I was surprised by some of the negative reviews I saw on Goodreads. While this isn’t the best book ever, it’s also not as bad as some reviews made it out to be.  \n   - I respectfully disagree with criticisms about the characters being immature, as I believe their actions are rooted in realistic emotional struggles.  \n\n- **Favorite Moments:**  \n   - Chapter 21: A sweet and memorable moment.  \n   - Chapter 22: A bit more intense, with some emotional heat.  \n   - Chapter 29: A little make-out session that added to the fun.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and entertaining listen, especially for fans of second-chance romances and friends-to-enemies-to-lovers tropes. While some readers found the characters immature, I connected deeply with the FMC’s struggles and appreciated the MMC’s patience and understanding. It’s a sweet, low-spice story with plenty of flirting and kissing, making it a fun and heartfelt read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Star Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️  \n- Spice Rating: 🌶️ (no spice, just flirting and kissing)  \n- Language Rating: 💛 (mild language)"

            "The author introduces captivating characters with unconventional jobs, such as Savannah, a hypnotist, offering a refreshing perspective within the romance genre. However, while the characters are intriguing, the development of Savannah and Mason's relationship feels underwhelming. As childhood best friends rekindle their connection, I anticipated a deeper exploration of their emotional bond, but instead, it was often overshadowed by physical intimacy.",
            "The book was less lighthearted than her previous works, which was somewhat disappointing. However, despite its flaws, I still found it enjoyable and rated it 4 stars.",
            "The book features numerous intense make-out scenes that I would classify as PG-13. While the author frequently incorporates these moments, I began to wonder if they were becoming excessive. Additionally, the novel addresses serious and potentially triggering topics, including inappropriate workplace behavior, professional sabotage, exploitation of fame, trust issues, and an inappropriate teacher-student relationship. These themes may be challenging for some readers."

However, I was surprised to discover that he wasn't actually under hypnosis for most of the book, which left me feeling quite confused.",
            "I absolutely loved Mason—he's truly wonderful, and his love is one of the highlights of the book. However, I have mixed feelings about Savannah. To be honest, part of my dislike stems from seeing too much of myself in her. She clung to a grudge for six years, refusing to move on despite everything Mason did for her. It was particularly disappointing when she broke a promise made just two weeks prior, especially after all she had endured.",

I laughed so many times.  \n\n- **Character Development (Mason)**  \n   - I absolutely loved Mason!!! He’s the best and so, so lovely. His love is one of the best things about the book. ❤️  \n\n- **Character Development (Savannah)**  \n   - Savannah I have mixed feelings about, and I'm gonna be honest… one of the reasons I don't really like her is because I see too much of myself in her. She held a grudge for six years and just wouldn't let it go, no matter what Mason did for her or what she found out.  \n\n- **Plot Expectations vs. Reality**  \n   - When I read the synopsis, I thought the MMC would get hypnotized and then not come back completely until the FMC brought him back. But… that didn't happen. For the majority of the book, I thought he was still hypnotized, only to find out he wasn't. That really confused me.  \n\n- **Moral Dilemmas and Character Decisions**  \n   - Savannah breaking a promise she made not even two weeks before sucked. Especially after everything she went through.  \n\n- **Favorite Quotes**  \n   - \"You're the one I want, Sinclair.\"  \n   - \"You hate power outages. I came over to check on you.\"  \n   - “Savannah Rose Sinclair, I could be robbed of every single one of my senses and I would still know you.” 😭😭😭  \n   - “You’re my dream, Sinclair.”  \n   - “I’d give up the world for you.”  \n   - “You help me to be the man I want to be, by keeping me on my toes and challenging me. No one understands me the way that you do, and no one else loves the way you love. I adore your big emotions.”  \n   - “Sinclair, you’re never too much for someone who can’t get enough of you.”  \n   - “That someone is me. I can’t get enough of you.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, it was a good book, and I think people should give it a try. I just expected a bit more from it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)  \n\nHuge thanks to NetGalley and Montlake for this ARC in exchange for an honest review!  \n#HypnotizedbyLove #NetGalley #Montlake"

            "The pacing of the story is generally well-executed, though the ending feels slightly drawn out. It could have concluded effectively after the revelation of the rumor, yet an additional conflict extends the resolution. While this final conflict is emotionally charged, it seems somewhat superfluous and detracts from Savannah’s character development. The narrative is a second-chance, enemies-to-lovers tale centered on Savannah and Mason, who were once deeply in love in high school but experienced a significant fallout. Six years later, Mason returns to their hometown, prompting Savannah, now a hypnotist, to reluctantly reengage with him. The story skillfully avoids excessive flashbacks, focusing instead on their present-day interactions. The central mystery revolves around a rumor Mason spread in high school, which is revealed toward the story's climax.",

Mason has always harbored affection for Savannah, even after their fallout, and his unwavering care encourages her to reevaluate her beliefs about their shared past. While Savannah's growth is evident, it occasionally feels inconsistent; her response to a late-book conflict underscores her ongoing struggle with trust.

            "In the book, Savannah's immaturity is apparent, yet her behavior is understandable given the trauma she has experienced. A damaging rumor about her dating a professor led to public humiliation, hate messages, and lingering stigma that persisted even six years later. The blame does not rest on her shoulders; the professor was a predator who exploited students, including her best friend, Bridge, who started the rumor to deflect attention from herself.\n\nInitially, Mason's behavior is off-putting. After asking Savannah out and being declined, he quickly turns his attention to her best friend, making it difficult for Savannah to see his feelings as genuine. His failure to explain why he stood her up for a dance, coupled with his lack of communication, left Savannah struggling to trust him. Only when he finally attempts to apologize—far too late—does it become clear just how complicated their relationship has become."

            "Savannah grapples with numerous personal issues, often helping others while simultaneously creating barriers in her own life. Lacking self-confidence, she remains blind to the reality of her love life and proves frustratingly self-sabotaging, obstructing her own path to happiness. Although I found her perspective occasionally exasperating, I recognized that many people struggle with self-sabotage due to fear or feelings of unworthiness. Thankfully, Mason is utterly captivated by her, demonstrating kindness and patience as he navigates her emotional hurdles. His unwavering support highlights that even the most challenging women can find a partner willing to weather the ups and downs of life. In contrast, Savannah’s twin sister, Sierra, appears more mature and open-minded, suggesting a deeper level of honesty and understanding than Savannah, the elder sibling. Overall, Mason embodies the hope that true love endures, even in the face of personal struggles.",

It delves into themes of miscommunication, expectations, grudges, and forgiveness, making it relatable for many readers. One quote that resonated with me was Savannah's reflection on societal pressures: “Where do my defensive walls come from with regard to my job? A lot of places, probably. I know that part of it is from getting labeled in school. That when they say you’re ‘gifted and talented,’ there are expectations about the life you’ll lead and the job you’ll have. If you’re not out in the world curing cancer, then you’re just wasting your life, even if what you’re doing makes you happy. How even when you are actually doing well, you still feel like a failure.” This sentiment effectively captures the internal struggle many face regarding their self-worth and societal expectations."

This dynamic felt excessive and repetitive.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story relies heavily on miscommunication and angst, which I understand is necessary for drama, but it felt overdone here. The miscommunications piled up to the point where it became overwhelming. Every time I turned a page, someone was saying or doing something to make Savannah feel worse about herself. While I appreciate conflict in a story, this felt excessive and tiresome.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  Mason, in particular, was a character I liked a lot, but his actions were frustrating. Ghosting Savannah right after asking her out on a date and never explaining himself was one of the worst things he could have done, even if he wasn’t responsible for spreading the rumor that nearly ruined her life. This lack of communication and accountability made the relationships feel unbalanced and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Engagement and Resolution:**  \n  I finished the book because I wanted to see the happy ending (HEA) and because I had guessed who started the rumor early on.

Sadly, this one did not do that for me.\n\n- **Character Development (Savannah):**  \n  Savannah Sinclair knows how to hold a grudge. She's been holding onto her anger towards her former best friend Mason for so long she doesn't know anything but disdain for him. He stood her up for a high school dance and spread a rumor about her, and things were never the same. Savannah struck me as incredibly immature for a 24-year-old woman.

Confusingly enough, her twin sister and best friend both tell her Mason only has eyes for her. When he asks her to hypnotize him for an article, she reluctantly agrees, and everything changes. Savannah has to admit to herself that her feelings aren't as black and white as she thought. I got bored.

Although Savannah had the last 7% of the book to demonstrate significant growth, it still felt insufficient for her to achieve the maturity necessary for a healthy relationship.

While there is a legitimate reason for Savannah and Mason’s initial dislike (a high school rumor spread by Mason), the reveal of the rumor comes too late in the story. This delay makes Savannah’s distrust feel underdeveloped and less impactful, reducing the emotional weight of their conflict.  \n\n- **Character Growth and Consistency:**  \n  Savannah shows some growth throughout the novel, but this progress is undone during the typical fight/break-up moment common in romance novels. Her regression makes her seem undeserving of Mason and leaves the reader questioning whether she has truly evolved as a character.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The lack of early context for Savannah’s distrust and her immature behavior make it difficult to fully invest in her journey or root for her relationship with Mason. By the time the past is revealed, it feels like an afterthought rather than a pivotal moment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggles to balance the enemies-to-lovers trope effectively, with Savannah’s character development and emotional depth falling short.

            "Many critics perceive the characters as immature, but considering they're in their 20s and just entering adulthood, that expectation feels unrealistic. Let’s face it: many of us still struggle with maturity at that age (myself included). I enjoyed the book and its characters precisely because they resonated with my experiences. Their flaws and naive thoughts are, in fact, reflective of the real struggles faced by people in that stage of life—I’ve encountered even more extreme behavior from peers in this age group.",

I don’t think it’s realistic to expect them to be fully mature. Let’s be honest, a lot of us aren’t that mature in our 20s (talking about myself).  \n  - I liked the book and characters because they felt realistic to me. Even the immature thoughts—I’ve honestly seen worse from people in that age group.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - This book is definitely a YA friends-to-enemies story that later becomes enemies-to-lovers.  \n  - It’s a light read, and there’s no spice at all, but if you aren’t into spice, you would like this.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Relevance:**  \n  - As someone who is a fan of hypnosis and studying to be a counselor, I found the book relatable and engaging.  \n\n- **Critique:**  \n  - I did get a little annoyed at how much the main character hated Mason for what happened in the past, but it is what it is.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

The story could have been more engaging if the conflict had been more nuanced or if the stakes felt higher.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style is enjoyable and well-crafted, even though the story itself falls short.

Initially, I wanted to dislike Mason for how he hurt Savannah, but his heartfelt explanation for breaking her heart won me over. Mason is truly a sweetheart, and his love for Savannah shines through in his quote: \"You have been hypnotizing me since the day I came back.\"",
            "This is a quick and hilarious read. Savannah shines, especially when she's had a few too many drinks—she’s wonderfully entertaining in her inebriated state. One of my favorite quotes from her perfectly captures her charm: \"Nachos are basically just tacos that didn't have their life together.\""

        "conclusion": "This novel is a delightful and entertaining read, filled with humor and memorable characters. Savannah’s quirky personality and Mason’s heartfelt redemption arc make the story engaging and enjoyable.",

Her character felt underdeveloped, which detracted from the story's depth. Despite the novel's complex themes of love, forgiveness, and letting go, Savannah's pettiness and shallowness held the narrative back.  \n\n- **Character Development (Mason):**  \n  Mason, the male lead, was well-written and emotionally mature, standing in stark contrast to Savannah. He came across as patient, fun, and developed beyond high school-level emotions. His character was a highlight of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict (Third Act Breakup):**  \n  The third-act breakup was a pivotal moment, but it left me rooting for Mason to move on rather than reconcile with Savannah. Given her flaws, it felt like Mason deserved better, which made the resolution less satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel explores meaningful themes and features a compelling male lead, the underdeveloped and shallow portrayal of the female protagonist, Savannah, significantly hindered the story's potential. Mason's character was a standout, but the imbalance in character development and the unsatisfying resolution of the third-act breakup left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The balance between light-hearted moments and serious themes made it an enjoyable read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful mix of fun and depth, with well-developed characters, meaningful themes, and a thoughtful exploration of hypnosis. The twin bond between Savannah and Sierra added an extra layer of charm to the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It is full of teenage angst, even though the characters are 24.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Savannah is stuck in high school. The presumption the author makes is that she is stuck because she suffered terribly due to a false rumor. I'm not convinced. She struck me as a whiney teenybopper, and Mason could do better.  \n\n- **Personal Reaction to Characters:**  \n  It is really rare for me to dislike a character, so this is unusual.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book may appeal to high school students due to its themes of teenage angst, I found the main character, Savannah, unconvincing and overly whiny. This made it difficult for me to connect with her, which is unusual for me as a reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I found myself so invested in them that, as a married person with a child, I even felt like I might be in love with Mason myself.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The book had laugh-out-loud moments and witty banter, which made the reading experience incredibly enjoyable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The story had a well-balanced mix of slow and fast burn, keeping me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI absolutely loved this book and am eager to read more from Sariah Wilson.

There was none at all! However, I did enjoy the banter between Mason and Savannah.

However, my main concern was the lack of chemistry between Savannah and Mason, which diminished the romance's impact. Mason's decision to stay away from Savannah for seven years, despite being in love with her, felt odd and unrealistic. His claim of loving her since they were 15 also seemed unconvincing, especially given her previous unkindness toward him stemming from misunderstandings.",
