        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was very excited to read this book, especially after learning it was an Amazon First Reads pick for January. However, it fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Plot and Thriller Elements:**  \n  The thriller aspect of the book felt minimal. I was intrigued by the premise of a character with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and how it would play out in a thriller, but the actual incident that should have been a central plot point was underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspectives:**  \n  The story is told from two perspectives: Eddie (the presenting personality) and Pär (his alter personality). While this dual perspective was interesting, the narrative focused heavily on rehashing the past and Eddie’s interactions with Lucy (his deceased sister-in-law). I would have preferred more focus on Eddie and Pär’s current life and how they navigate the aftermath of their time in a mental health facility.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The book had all the right ingredients for a great thriller but lacked the special \"je ne sais quoi\" that makes a story truly stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising premise and intriguing setup, the book failed to deliver as a compelling thriller. The overemphasis on past events and underdeveloped thriller elements left me disappointed, leading me to stop reading at the 50% mark.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I expected it to focus more on dual/split personalities, but it centered more on Eddie's upbringing, which felt predictable. From the moment Andy was introduced and mistaken for Eddie, I could see where the story was heading.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The novel reminded me of *A Little Life*, though it was less graphic and included the element of a split personality.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Eddie's upbringing was a central focus, but the predictability of his story arc lessened its impact. The split personality aspect felt unnecessary, though I understand why it was included.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was an engaging read, it didn’t fully deliver on the expectations set by its description. The focus on Eddie's upbringing was predictable, and the split personality element, though understandable, didn’t add significant value to the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
