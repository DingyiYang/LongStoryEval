            "Although the pacing fluctuates at times, I found the story engaging and would be interested in reading more from the author in the future.",
            "In this captivating tale, the protagonist Ash embarks on a quest to find a powerful magical book. The supporting characters—Ramsay, Callum, and Marlowe—add significant depth and complexity to the narrative. I particularly enjoyed the charming romance, which is characterized by open communication, especially through Callum's character. While the characters are flawed and sometimes frustrating, their actions resonate as true to their ages and circumstances. The representation in this book is exceptional: Ash is a trans character, Ramsay frequently shifts gender and pronouns, and there’s a polyamorous relationship at play. The author, being Black, queer, and trans, brings a level of authenticity and richness that enhances the story.",
            "A quote that resonated with me was, “Energy is infinite, and love is energy, so love has the potential to be infinite too.” This beautifully captures the book’s central themes of love and connection.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed reading *Infinity Alchemist*, which rekindled my love for YA fantasy. The intriguing magic system, tiered and based on alchemy, draws energy from the body, adding depth to the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Infinity Alchemist* is a delightful YA fantasy with a unique magic system, engaging characters, and heartwarming romance. Despite some pacing issues, it’s an entertaining read with meaningful representation and thought-provoking themes. I’m excited to see where the story goes next.",

The magic system, based on alchemy and separated into tiers, is intriguing, as it draws energy from the body.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The main character, Ash, is sent on a quest to find a magical book with immense power. The side characters—Ramsay, Callum, and Marlowe—play significant roles and add depth to the story. I adored the romance, which was incredibly cute and featured open communication, largely thanks to Callum’s character. The characters are flawed and occasionally frustrating, but their actions felt realistic given their ages and circumstances.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  While the pacing isn’t always consistent, I remained entertained throughout and would be open to reading future sequels.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The representation in this book is outstanding. Ash is trans, Ramsay changes gender and pronouns regularly, and there’s a polyamorous relationship. Additionally, the author is Black, queer, and trans, which adds authenticity and depth to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Quotes:**  \n  One quote that stood out to me was, “Energy is infinite, and love is energy, so love has the potential to be infinite too.” It beautifully encapsulates the book’s themes of love and connection.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Infinity Alchemist* is a delightful YA fantasy with a unique magic system, engaging characters, and heartwarming romance. Despite some pacing issues, it’s an entertaining read with meaningful representation and thought-provoking themes. I’m excited to see where the story goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot suffers from a weak McGuffin chase that feels unnecessarily prolonged and ends too abruptly. Significant pacing issues contribute to a bloated and tedious narrative, resulting in a lack of investment in the story. This is a major drawback.",
            "The book's representation is a standout feature, particularly in its nuanced portrayal of the trans-male protagonist, Ash, and the genderfluid character, Ramsay. The polyamorous relationship challenges typical YA fantasy tropes, making the representation feel organic and authentic. However, Ramsay’s shifting pronouns can disrupt readability, especially during scenes with multiple male characters. \n\nAsh, while an understandable product of teenage angst, comes across as quick-tempered, selfish, and immature. His self-pity and hypocrisy regarding privilege and education render him insufferable, and his character development arrives too late in the story, feeling unearned. Additionally, the romantic relationships lack sufficient depth, resulting in unconvincing emotional connections between characters.",
            "The writing style struggles to meet the demands of the fantasy genre, as emotional moments are often told rather than shown. This lack of depth diminishes reader engagement. Additionally, the book's length exacerbates these issues, resulting in a narrative that feels overly long and unfocused.",
            "The world-building is underdeveloped. Although the book touches on the societal impact of alchemy and the importance of The Book of Source, these aspects lack depth. The Houses and the wider world feel vague, lacking the detail needed to create an immersive setting.",
            "*Infinity Alchemist* presents an intriguing concept, delving into alchemy as an innate ability while critiquing elitism and privilege in academia. The portrayal of a trans-male protagonist and a genderfluid character in a polyamorous relationship is both refreshing and well-crafted. However, the fantasy elements and world-building could be more fully realized."

        "conclusion": "Despite its promising concept and strong representation, *Infinity Alchemist* fails to deliver a compelling fantasy narrative. Weak plot, pacing issues, underdeveloped characters, and insufficient world-building hinder the book’s potential. While the LGBTQ+ themes are commendable, they are not enough to carry the story.

The idea of a trans-male protagonist and a genderfluid character in a polyamorous relationship is refreshing and well-executed. However, the execution of the fantasy elements and world-building falls short.\n\n- **Representation and LGBTQ+ Themes:**  \n  The representation in the book is a standout feature. The trans-male protagonist, Ash, and the genderfluid character, Ramsay, are handled with nuance. The polyamorous relationship subverts typical YA fantasy tropes, and the representation feels natural and unforced. However, Ramsay’s changing pronouns occasionally disrupt readability, particularly in scenes with multiple male characters.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is weak, revolving around a McGuffin chase that feels overly drawn out and concludes too abruptly. Pacing issues are significant, making the story feel bloated and tedious. The lack of investment in the narrative is a major drawback.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ash, the protagonist, is portrayed as quick-tempered, selfish, and immature, which is understandable for a teenager. However, his self-pitying and hypocritical attitude toward privilege and education makes him insufferable. His character development occurs too late in the story and feels unearned. The romantic relationships lack sufficient development, making emotional connections between characters unconvincing.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is underdeveloped. While the book mentions the societal impact of alchemy and the significance of The Book of Source, these elements are not explored in depth. The Houses and broader world feel indistinct and lack the necessary detail to make the setting immersive.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style struggles to balance the fantasy genre’s demands. Emotional beats are often told rather than shown, and the narrative lacks the depth needed to fully engage readers. The book’s length exacerbates these issues, making it feel overly long and unfocused.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising concept and strong representation, *Infinity Alchemist* fails to deliver a compelling fantasy narrative.

            "The story features a trans boy as the main character and a gender-fluid character whose presentation shifts naturally, and both elements are handled with casual ease.",
            "The fantasy world is captivating and unique, showcasing a system of magic rooted in alchemy. It effectively portrays a segregated class structure where only the wealthy and powerful have the opportunity to study and practice this art.",
            "This story adeptly addresses themes of gender, sexuality, and love. While it acknowledges the existence of oppression and hatred, it deliberately avoids making these issues the focal point of the narrative.",
            "This YA fantasy romance features trans characters and polyamory, presenting a relatable portrayal of adolescence. The story centers on an emotionally charged and often angry main character whose questionable decisions resonate with the experiences of young adults, highlighting the developmental challenges of navigating hormonal changes. The novel effectively captures the essence of its intended audience."

        "conclusion": "*Infinity Alchemist* is a compelling YA fantasy romance that excels in its representation of gender, sexuality, and love, set in an imaginative and thought-provoking world.

This aligns with the intended audience, as it reflects the experiences of young adults whose pre-frontal cortexes are not fully developed and who are navigating hormonal changes.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  - The handling of gender, sexuality, and love is well-executed.  \n  - The story includes a trans boy main character and a gender-fluid character whose gendered presentation changes naturally, and these aspects are treated as no big deal.  \n  - While the world contains oppression and hatred, these issues are not centered around gender or sexuality.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  - The fantasy world is engaging and distinct, featuring magic (alchemy) and a segregated class system where only the wealthy and powerful typically have access to studying and practicing alchemy.  \n\n- **Narration (Audio Version):**  \n  - The audio narration is excellent, enhancing the overall experience of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - While not a perfect book, it is enjoyable and has the potential to become someone’s new favorite.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Infinity Alchemist* is a compelling YA fantasy romance that excels in its representation of gender, sexuality, and love, set in an imaginative and thought-provoking world.

            "The story's pacing was uneven, starting slowly and concluding too abruptly. The final chapters felt rushed, as if the author sought to resolve everything in a hurry. Additionally, the distribution of point-of-view chapters was inconsistent, with Ramsay's perspective disappearing halfway through and a fourth character occasionally providing brief insights. The timeline of events and character relationships was jarring, as the characters' actions and emotional responses seemed disproportionate to the short time they had known each other. For instance, Ash's rapid commitment to Ramsay after just two weeks, followed by an equally swift connection with Callum, stretched believability.",
            "The characters, aged 18-20, often came across as frustratingly naïve and made questionable decisions, particularly Ash. Nevertheless, I found myself liking the main characters overall. The representation of queer and gender identities was commendable, with Ash being trans, Ramsay identifying as bigender, and all three main characters being queer. However, the chemistry among the trio—Ash, Ramsay, and Callum—felt unconvincing, partly due to the rushed timeline. The relationships developed unrealistically quickly, with Ash falling in love with both Ramsay and Callum within just two weeks. Additionally, Ramsay's exaggerated reactions to Ash's betrayal and her own past actions contributed to the story's oddness.",

These portrayals felt authentic within the hierarchical and conservative setting. I also enjoyed the exploration of polyamory, as Ash develops feelings for both Ramsay and Callum. However, the descriptions of emotions and relationships often felt superficial, with too much telling rather than showing (e.g., “He felt excited”). The transitions from attraction to love seemed rushed and underdeveloped. Additionally, I had some issues with Ash’s character motivations. While his irrationality and temper are understandable, his lack of self-preservation instincts and frequent flare-ups felt incongruent, leaving me puzzled about the underlying reasons for his constant tension.",

            "The pacing of the book was a major concern for me. Much of it comprised repetitive conversations, while the action sequences were rushed and poorly condensed into a brief section at the end. I usually enjoy dialogue-heavy narratives when they are vibrant and packed with emotion, but here, the interactions felt flat and uninspired.",
            "The romantic relationships in the story felt underdeveloped, making it difficult for me to connect with them. This was unexpected, as I typically find this aspect to be a strength in the author’s previous works. Some dialogues, particularly between Ash and Callum, seemed stilted, while Ash's bond with Ramsey felt slightly more genuine. Overall, however, the relationships did not resonate with me.",
            "I found the world-building and magic system to be convoluted. The numerous ideas felt jumbled together, with some concepts lacking clarity. For instance, while the system is termed alchemy, it was also referred to as magic, source, and chaos. Although I grasped some elements, the explanations and discussions surrounding it were overly complex and confusing.",
            "I had high hopes for this book, having enjoyed the author's previous works and my fondness for fantasy. The story began promisingly, introducing an intriguing world and a captivating magic system. Ash, the main character, stood out as a compelling figure—powerful and ambitious but constrained by class and background. I also appreciated the queer representation and the exploration of polyamory."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Initial Impressions:**  \n  I was really looking forward to this book because I’ve enjoyed other works by Kacen Callender and I love a good fantasy. The story started off well, with an intriguing world and magic system. Ash, the main character, struck me as cool—powerful and ambitious, yet limited by their class and background. I was also excited about the queer representation and the inclusion of polyamory.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  Unfortunately, I found the world-building and magic system to be messy. It felt like there were too many ideas mashed together, and some concepts weren’t clear. For example, the system is called alchemy, but it was previously referred to as magic, source, and chaos. While I somewhat understood it, the explanations and conversations about it were overly complicated and confusing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was a significant issue for me. Most of the book consisted of repetitive conversations, while the action scenes were rushed and condensed into a very short section at the end. I don’t mind dialogue-heavy books if they’re filled with fun, passionate feelings, and personality, but this felt flat and uninspired.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Development:**  \n  The romantic relationships lacked development, which made it hard for me to connect with them. This was surprising because I’ve found this to be a strength in Callender’s previous books. Some conversations, especially between Ash and Callum, felt stilted. Ash’s connection with Ramsey felt a bit more natural, but overall, the relationships didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this book, I found it disappointing. The messy world-building, uneven pacing, and underdeveloped relationships made it hard for me to stay invested. I’m sure many readers will enjoy it, but something felt off to me.

Conversely, the last 30 pages felt rushed, almost as if they were crammed in to reach a stopping point for a potential sequel. I’m not a fan of summarizing extended time periods; I prefer to see characters develop their relationships in detail. However, I appreciated the conflicts and struggles that steered clear of themes like transphobia or shame, which I found refreshing.",

Although he's incredibly skilled, his studies are limited to official instruction at school. When Ramsay discovers Ash's talent, he sees the potential for Ash to assist in locating the Book of Source. The dynamic between Ash and Ramsay is beautifully developed, as they quickly grow closer. I appreciated the representation of both characters—Ash as a trans individual and Ramsay as genderfluid—presented without the typical struggles of transphobia or shame. Their exploration of a potential polyamorous relationship with Callum is intriguing, and I would love to see more emphasis on equality among the three, as well as a deeper exploration of Callum's character in the present.",

That said, it was still a satisfying conclusion in many ways.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  *Infinity Alchemist* was a fun and entertaining YA fantasy read, making it a good standalone novel for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a slightly rushed ending, *Infinity Alchemist* delivers an engaging and enjoyable YA fantasy experience with strong characters and solid world-building.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars.  \n\n*I received this book as a free eBook ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*"

While Ash carries most of the story, other characters like Ramsey, Callum, Ash’s father, and a few others also share their thoughts. This multi-POV structure made it slightly challenging to keep track of the plot, especially with Ramsey’s gender switching regularly.  \n\n- **Magic System (Alchemy):**  \n  The story features a rich and immersive use of alchemy, which was a highlight for me. Unlike many epic fantasies that are too grounded in reality with minimal magic, this novel integrates alchemy consistently and in ways that feel logical and well-developed.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The polyamorous intimacy in the story is not the central focus but develops naturally as a result of the closeness required for the characters’ quest. I appreciated how the characters were mindful of their emotions and engaged in meaningful conversations to resolve conflicts, rather than letting issues fester.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a richly layered epic fantasy with a complex plot, a well-crafted magic system, and emotionally intelligent characters.

            "This book features transgender characters and polyamory, topics that are often underrepresented in literature. The portrayal of transgender experiences, especially Ashen's struggles with bindings and intimacy, felt authentic and meaningful. Ramsey's gender fluidity was also well-executed, with pronoun use shifting seamlessly according to their expression. It was refreshing that their identities were integral to their characters without overshadowing the overall narrative. The polyamorous dynamic among the three main characters was depicted in a healthy, non-sex-driven manner, a beautiful rarity in literary portrayals. Initially, I found Ashen annoying due to his constant complaints, but as the story unfolded, I recognized that his and the other characters’ emotional and impulsive reactions were realistic for teenagers, leading me to become more invested in their journeys."

            "I appreciated the plot, overall story, and fantasy elements in this book. The partnership between Ash Woods, a young groundskeeper’s assistant with a gift for alchemy, and Ramsay Thorne in their quest for 'The Book of Source' was both intriguing and engaging. However, the execution was lacking; the pacing felt uneven, and I struggled to follow the timeline. At times, the story felt disjointed, which hindered my ability to remain immersed.",
            "I found the pronoun usage challenging, particularly since Ramsay is genderfluid and their pronouns can change mid-page. With three main characters all using he/him pronouns, it was often confusing to track actions and interactions, which hindered my connection to the characters. However, the book excels in representation, featuring trans, queer, genderfluid, and polyamorous characters. I can easily see this becoming a favorite for readers who appreciate inclusive and diverse narratives.",

The concept of Ash Woods, a young groundskeeper’s assistant with an innate gift for alchemy, partnering with Ramsay Thorne to find ‘The Book of Source’ was intriguing and engaging.  \n\n- **Execution and Pacing:**  \n  However, the execution of these elements fell short for me. The pacing was off, and I had a difficult time following the timeline. The story felt disjointed at times, which made it harder to stay immersed.  \n\n- **Descriptions and World-Building:**  \n  The author lacked in the description department, both in describing the magical elements and the characters themselves. This left me feeling disconnected from the characters and less invested in their journeys.  \n\n- **Characterization and Pronoun Usage:**  \n  I struggled with the pronoun usage, especially since Ramsay is genderfluid, and their pronouns change sometimes mid-page. With three main characters all using he/him pronouns simultaneously, it became confusing to track who was doing what. This added to my difficulty in connecting with the characters.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  On a positive note, the representation in this book was top-notch. It included trans, queer, and genderfluid representation, as well as polyamory. I can genuinely see this being someone’s favorite book of the year because of its inclusive and diverse characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Infinity Alchemist* had all the pieces to be a great book—an intriguing plot, strong fantasy elements, and excellent representation—it ultimately fell short for me due to issues with pacing, descriptions, and pronoun usage.

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven. Although the slow start was effective for worldbuilding and character development, the sudden accelerations disrupted the flow. This inconsistency heightened my anxiety during the quieter moments, as I anticipated significant developments that didn't always come. I would have preferred the faster sections to be extended, enhancing detail and tension.",
            "This book is refreshingly queer-normative, showcasing a society where gender, sexuality, and relationships are widely accepted, despite underlying elitism and classism. The representation is commendably diverse, featuring a trans male protagonist, a gender-fluid character, and a pansexual male lead, all portrayed with authenticity and ease. The love triangle—potentially evolving into a throuple—adds an engaging dynamic, and by the end, I found myself rooting for their collective happiness.\n\nWhile the characters are intriguing and distinct, they sometimes come across as younger than their late teens or early twenties, often indulging in whining and making questionable decisions. Ash, Ramsey, and Callum each bring unique struggles and perspectives to the table, skillfully highlighted through alternating points of view. However, their tendency to neglect their responsibilities when together occasionally became frustrating. Overall, the story provides a vibrant exploration of queer relationships amid a complex societal backdrop.",
            "The world and magic system in *Infinity Alchemist* are both intricate and captivating. While everyone can access Source, only select individuals are permitted to wield its power, introducing an intriguing element of societal control.

Everyone has access to Source, the magic system, but only certain people are allowed to use it, which adds an intriguing layer of societal control. I found the magic system incredibly cool, though I wished there was more explanation or a guide to the Houses or tiers to make it easier to follow.  \n\n- **Sexuality and Relationships:**  \n  The book is highly queer-normative, which I appreciated. Gender, sexuality, and relationships are widely accepted and normalized within this society, despite the presence of elitism and classism. The representation is diverse, featuring a trans male main character, a gender-fluid character, and a pansexual male main character—all handled with ease and authenticity. The love triangle (or potential throuple) was a fun dynamic, and I found myself rooting for the throuple by the end.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters, while interesting and dynamic, often felt younger than their late teens/early twenties due to their tendency to whine and make poor decisions. Ash, Ramsey, and Callum each had unique struggles and perspectives, which were highlighted through alternating POVs. However, when they were together, they seemed to forget their responsibilities, which was frustrating at times.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was uneven. The story started slow, which was fine for worldbuilding and character introduction, but then it would suddenly accelerate before slowing down again. This inconsistency created anxiety during the slower parts, as I kept waiting for major developments. I wished the faster sections had been stretched out to build more detail and tension.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Infinity Alchemist* is a unique and interesting queer YA fantasy with a complex magic system, diverse representation, and dynamic characters. While the pacing could have been more consistent and the characters’ decision-making more mature, it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for fans of queer-normative worlds and intricate magic systems.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It wasn’t until about 35-40% of the way through that my skepticism transitioned into renewed interest.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  When Ash meets Callum, the stakes became higher, and Ash’s relationship with Ramsey was called into question.

            "I absolutely loved Ramsay and Callum! The author excels at developing three distinct and well-rounded characters: Ash, Ramsay, and Callum. Callum is sweet and thoughtful, while Ramsay is intelligent and practical. However, Ash is among the most frustrating main characters I've encountered. At 18, he often comes across as immature, irrational, and stubborn, which made him insufferable at times. His frequent setbacks in personal growth almost led me to give up on the story. \n\nOn the positive side, the queer representation is outstanding and seamlessly woven into the world-building and magic system. Characters are accepted for their identities and relationships—it's portrayed as the norm. Ramsay Thorne, a genderfluid character, shifts genders from chapter to chapter, a reflection of the Thorne bloodline’s magic. Both Ash, a trans main character, and Callum, who identifies as pansexual or bisexual, fully accept and respect Ramsay’s identity without question.",

The emotional depth of the story surpasses the physical scenes, which often end with a “fade to black.” I believe this approach to mature themes should be embraced in YA literature, as it fosters a healthier relationship with these topics."

Kacen Callender does an excellent job of creating three equally full and different characters in Ash, Ramsay, and Callum. Callum is sweet and thoughtful. Ramsay is intelligent and practical.  \n  - Ash, however, is one of the most frustrating MCs I’ve ever read. Despite being 18, he often feels immature, irrational, stubborn, and contrarian. His frequent regression in growth made him insufferable at times, and I almost quit reading because of him.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  - The queer representation is phenomenal and seamlessly integrated into the world-building and magic system. Characters are not shamed for their identities or relationships, and it’s treated as the norm.  \n  - Ramsay Thorne, a genderfluid MC, shifts genders chapter to chapter, which is explained through the Thorne bloodline’s magic. Ash, a trans MMC, and Callum, a pan/bi MMC, both accept and respect Ramsay’s identity without question.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  - The world-building is incredible, feeling fully realized without overwhelming info dumps.  \n  - The magic system, based on energy (or Source), feels fresh and innovative, even though similar concepts have been explored before.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing is captivating, with beautifully crafted passages that kept me hooked. I highlighted much of my physical copy because of the standout prose.  \n\n- **Themes and Maturity:**  \n  - The book fits well within the YA genre, with mature themes handled tastefully. The emotional depth outweighs physical scenes, which are often “fade to black.”  \n  - I believe this approach to mature themes should be normalized in YA literature, as it promotes a healthier relationship with such topics.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book has many strengths, including its rich character development, inclusive representation, immersive world-building, and captivating writing style. However, Ash’s frustrating and immature behavior significantly impacted my enjoyment of the story.

            "The story offers an engaging journey and a thrilling race against time to thwart an evil character, though its predictability detracts from the experience. Furthermore, the romance occasionally overshadows the main quest, which may not resonate with readers seeking a more action-oriented fantasy.",
            "Although Ash is of college age, they come across as somewhat younger than expected. In contrast to Ramsay, I initially assumed they were years apart, but that wasn’t the case. However, the characters are well-developed, and the diverse queer representation among the three main characters is commendable.",
            "The world-building feels insufficient; while the basics are provided, much is left to guesswork or brief allusions. We understand that people wield power, but the limits and consequences of that power remain unclear. The concept of Source is intriguing, yet we only learn about it through fragments and the insights of other characters. A more comprehensive exploration of the world’s systems and rules would have significantly enhanced the story.",
            "I switched from an eArc review to the audiobook for a more portable reading experience, and I found myself deeply engaged in the story. Narrator Wes Hass brilliantly immersed me in Ash and Ramsay’s journey; his voice was a perfect match for the narrative. I truly believe the audiobook enhanced my experience—without it, I might not have enjoyed the story as much."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Narration:**  \n  I switched from an eArc review to an audiobook to read on the go, and I found myself more engaged with the story. The narrator, Wes Hass, did an excellent job immersing me in Ash and Ramsay’s journey. His voice perfectly fit the narrative, and I genuinely think the audiobook enhanced my experience. Without it, I might have enjoyed the story less.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ash, being of college age, felt and sounded a bit younger than anticipated. In comparison to Ramsay, I thought they were years apart in age, which wasn’t the case. Despite this, the characters were well-developed, and the diverse queer representation among the main three characters was excellent.\n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The story had a significant journey and a race against time to stop an evil character, but it was somewhat predictable. Additionally, the romance sometimes overshadowed the main quest, which might not appeal to readers looking for a more action-driven fantasy.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building felt lacking. While we get the basics, there’s a lot left to guesswork or quick mentions. For instance, we know people hold power, but we’re not told about its limits or repercussions. The concept of Source was fascinating, but we only learn about it through tidbits Ash picks up and brief knowledge from other characters. A deeper understanding of the world’s system and its rules would have strengthened the story.\n\n- **Accessibility:**  \n  If you’re new to fantasy or looking for a more accessible entry point, this book could be an excellent place to start. It balances fantasy elements with romance and a straightforward plot, making it approachable for young teens.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an enjoyable book with strong queer representation and engaging narration, especially in audiobook format. While it has some predictability and lacks depth in world-building, it’s a solid choice for young teens or those new to the fantasy genre. I recommend it for its diverse characters and accessible storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book overly relied on dialogue about relationships, neglecting to establish a solid foundation for those connections. The pacing, coupled with shallow character development and worldbuilding, hindered my engagement with the story.",
            "The characters in the story come across as awkward and flat, lacking the necessary connection to make their relationships believable. While Ramsay is sympathetic, he fails to captivate. Ash begins as an intriguing character but quickly devolves into the clichéd outspoken and rash protagonist often found in YA literature. The third character in the love triangle feels underdeveloped and pales in comparison to Ramsay and Ash. Additionally, Ash's continuous hostility towards those with wealth and status comes off as unrealistic and shallow, revealing a lack of depth in his personal growth.",
            "The worldbuilding was underdeveloped, falling short of creating a vivid or immersive setting. The magic system, centered around alchemy, lacked depth and logical boundaries, straying from traditional concepts and feeling inconsistent—such as its ability to create fire, heal, and share memories. Ultimately, the magic system's potential was unfulfilled, resulting in a hollow and unsatisfying experience.",
            "The exploration of the haves and have-nots dynamic felt underdeveloped and lacked integration with the characters' arcs. While the themes of power and educational disparities were introduced, they were not fully explored, resulting in a somewhat superficial treatment."

The magic system, in particular, was disappointing and underdeveloped. Despite some initial intrigue, the story failed to maintain my interest, leading me to stop reading at 76%. I hope for better execution in future works by the author.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel follows Ash Woods, an aspiring alchemist without a license, who takes a job as a groundskeeper after failing to secure a spot at an alchemic institute. When he’s caught practicing alchemy illegally, he embarks on a life-changing quest that alters the future of alchemy. The premise is very unique, though I’m still processing my feelings about the story as a whole.  \n\n- **Magic System and World-Building:**  \n  The magic system and world-building are intricate and fascinating, though at times they felt a bit confusing. There’s a lot of potential for expansion, and the concepts introduced are unusual and intriguing.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are well-written and act their age, which I appreciated. They are flawed, realistic, and relatable. The diverse representation in terms of race, gender expression, and relationships is outstanding. The novel includes trans representation, gender fluid representation, and polyamorous representation, which I found amazing.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  There were some pacing issues, with certain parts feeling drawn out while others felt rushed. A more balanced pace would have made the story more engaging and immersive for me.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel touches on complex societal issues, adding depth to the narrative. This aspect, combined with the strong characters and representation, makes the story stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an extremely unique read with a compelling premise, strong characters, and excellent representation. While I didn’t connect with it as deeply as I hoped, it was still an interesting and thought-provoking novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nBig thanks to the author, publisher, and NetGalley for providing me with this ARC."

            "The pacing was uneven, primarily focused on Ash's anger and pursuit of Ramsay. The ending rushed through crucial elements, leaving key aspects like the Book of Source unexplained, which was frustrating.",
            "The book's representation of queer and POC characters is commendable. However, I found the main character, Ash, off-putting due to her rashness, argumentativeness, and stubbornness. Initially, I expected Ramsay to be more compelling, but as the story unfolded, I became increasingly indifferent to her, despite her qualities—long black hair, sarcasm, and intelligence—that typically endear characters to me. In contrast, Callum emerged as the most engaging and likable member of the trio. His rationality and emotional intelligence serve as the glue that binds Ash and Ramsay together."

I wished for more depth and clarity in this aspect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Infinity Alchemist* was a highly anticipated read for me, and while it delivered on queer representation and an intriguing magic system, it fell short in terms of character likability, romance pacing, and world-building. Despite these flaws, it was still a wild ride with a lot to appreciate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

When he is presented with the opportunity to study under an alchemist in exchange for help in locating a legendary artifact, Ash finds himself drawn into a perilous and exciting adventure.",
            "At the heart of this book lies a powerful romance. The story's alchemy compels characters to reveal their innermost selves and forge deep connections through empathy, resulting in intense and swift bonds. Although I'm not usually a fan of love triangles, the transformation of one into a triad was beautifully handled. The characters include Ash, a trans boy of color, and another character who frequently switches gender, all of whom are queer and whose identities are embraced without hesitation. This is the authentic queer representation I’ve long sought in YA fantasy.",

However, their dynamic takes a turn when Ash is imprisoned for practicing magic illegally. During his time in jail, he develops a relationship with Callum, Ramsey's ex, which adds emotional depth to the story. The exploration of how they would navigate these complex relationships upon Ash's release is both thought-provoking and expertly handled.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Ash, a trans boy, faces exclusion from the magical world due to his social class. His journey is both compelling and relatable, showcasing remarkable representation of queer identities, including trans, gender fluid, and bi/pan characters. Another standout figure is Ramsey Thorne, who possesses magic that enables her to change genders at will. This diversity among characters is one of the book's greatest strengths.",
            "I appreciated the book's distinctive magic system, where individual abilities are unique even within broad categories. The limitation of magic to trained individuals, along with the elitism of the universities, adds significant depth to the world-building. The rich tapestry of guilds—ranging from magical to policing and even unscrupulous—enhances the setting. The nuanced political system reflects the complexities of real-world power dynamics, while themes of exclusion, elitism, and identity are explored with both depth and sensitivity.",

It’s unique in that everyone’s magic, while broadly categorized, is distinct to each individual. The concept of magic being restricted to those who are trained, and the elitism of the universities, added depth to the world-building.\n\n- **Characters and Representation:**  \n  The protagonist, Ash, is a trans boy who is excluded from the magical world due to his class. His journey is compelling, and the representation of queer identities (trans, gender fluid, bi/pan) is fantastic. Ramsey Thorne, whose magic allows her to change genders at will, is another standout character. The diversity of the characters is a major strength of the book.\n\n- **Plot and Relationships:**  \n  The plot is intricate and engaging. Ash and Ramsey team up, sharing magic to achieve their goals, but their relationship becomes complicated when Ash is caught practicing magic illegally and jailed. While in jail, Ash forms a relationship with Callum, Ramsey’s ex, which adds layers of emotional complexity. The discussions about navigating these relationships if Ash is freed are thought-provoking and well-handled.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  The world-building is rich, with various guilds—some magical, some policing magic, and others less reputable. The political system is nuanced, reflecting the complexities of real-world power structures. The themes of exclusion, elitism, and identity are explored with depth and sensitivity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is an absolutely fabulous read, with a unique magic system, diverse and well-developed characters, and a plot that keeps you hooked. The queer representation is excellent, and the themes are handled with care. It’s a standout in the YA fantasy genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 4.5 or 5 stars."

The storytelling and creativity have left a strong impression on me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating read with a unique world, thrilling action, and heartfelt relationships. The blend of alchemy, adventure, and character dynamics kept me hooked from start to finish. I’m excited to see this potentially become a series and can’t wait for the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the enthusiasm and positive tone suggest a high rating."

Centered around Ash, a groundskeeper's assistant at a magic college, the story follows their reluctant partnership with Ramsay to clear their parents of murder and locate a powerful book. Unfortunately, the plot feels contrived, serving mainly to facilitate character interactions and romantic tension. Without these relationship-building elements, the narrative lacks substance.",

Their backstories—Ash’s struggle with poverty and Ramsay’s experience with his parents’ execution—fail to evoke empathy or make them relatable. As a result, the lack of charisma and depth in both characters makes it challenging to engage with their journey.",

The story unfolds over approximately one month, which, combined with the swift development of the main characters' relationship, may be difficult for some readers to accept. It follows Ash, who, after being denied admission to Lancaster College of Alchemy, takes a job as a groundskeeper’s assistant. He partners with Ramsay Thorne on a quest to locate the Book of Source, a powerful text believed to be mere legend.",

Ramsay, an antihero, emerged as my favorite.

Coming from upper-class backgrounds, they seemed oblivious to the privilege their wealth afforded them, especially in stark contrast to Ash’s circumstances. This lack of awareness rendered them unlikable, leaving me disengaged from the romance subplot. Additionally, the decision to spare Ash from execution felt contrived and unconvincing. The justifications presented lacked realism; rational individuals wouldn’t behave this way, and the story failed to offer a credible rationale for these actions.",
            "The imprisonment of Ash, an alchemist, raises logical inconsistencies. Given that alchemy depends on focus and imagination, it’s perplexing how one could confine an alchemist without drugging them to inhibit their mental clarity. Allowing Ash to remain clear-headed only sets the stage for a possible escape, yet this never occurs without any reasonable explanation. Moreover, the absurdity of Ash wandering with just a young, inexperienced guard diminishes the story’s credibility. When a fellow trainee guard recognizes the potential danger, the response is unconvincing, further undermining the logic of the situation."

The book's portrayal of a polyamorous relationship with pansexual characters is a refreshing departure from conventional romance tropes. The emotional and physical connection between Ramsey and Ash elevates their bond to new heights. Additionally, the narrative delves into second-chance romance, friends-to-lovers, and enemies-to-lovers dynamics.

The book also explores second-chance romance, friends-to-lovers, and enemies-to-lovers dynamics.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The representation in this book is fantastic, including LGBTQ+ themes, gender fluidity, a trans main character, pansexuality, and polyamory.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book evoked strong emotions, from protectiveness over the characters to the angst of their uncertain intentions. Ash’s body dysmorphia towards his chest could be triggering for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is phenomenal, offering rich world-building, well-developed characters, and an easy-to-follow yet intricate storyline. The representation, romance, and emotional depth make it a standout read. I can find no fault with it and would highly recommend it to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The premise of an unlicensed alchemist, Ash, being caught by Professor Ramsey and striking a deal to find the Book of Source is intriguing and effectively propels the story forward. However, the personal dynamics between Ash, Ramsey, and Callum prove to be more compelling than the main plot. At times, the search for the Book of Source loses momentum, dragging the pacing and diminishing overall engagement.",
            "Ash, a trans man grappling with a complicated family background, serves as a well-crafted and relatable protagonist. Ramsey, a genderfluid character burdened by a dark family history, enriches the narrative's complexity. Callum, Ramsey's ex-boyfriend and a member of the Redguard, introduces further dynamic elements to the plot. The story expertly examines the characters' sexualities and polyamorous relationships, portraying them with care and authenticity. The inclusion of queer and genderfluid characters like Ash and Ramsey enhances the depth and representation within the narrative.",
            "The alchemy system is confusing and poorly explained. An extra chapter or a clear breakdown of the alchemy levels and mechanics would enhance understanding. While the guide to house structures at the beginning of the book is helpful, a similar breakdown for alchemy levels would be equally beneficial.",

The love triangle among Ash, Ramsay, and Callum is refreshing, with the ideal outcome being a trio. Their slow and imperfect journey toward each other is delightful. The book also excels in diversity, showcasing trans and genderfluid representation as well as polyamory, all presented in a normalized and unremarkable way.",

Key moments, such as the development of trust and growth between Ash and Ramsay, are rushed and underexplored, leaving their relationship lacking depth. The narrative feels compressed, as though it were crammed into a single book without the necessary space to unfold. Additionally, the central quest suffers from repetitiveness and false starts, leading to an abrupt ending that doesn't fully resonate, especially given the predictability of the twist.

While it offers a lighthearted fantasy experience, it ultimately falls short in originality and depth.",

The protagonist, Ash, is portrayed as an \"angsty, angry teen,\" yet his behavior often seems more fitting for an 11-year-old than an 18-year-old. His thoughts and actions are inconsistent with his age, making it difficult to connect with him. Furthermore, Ash's overwhelming power compared to others diminishes the stakes of the story and renders his character unrealistically extraordinary.",

For example, the ability to project one’s gender so others can identify it at a glance was a unique and thoughtful touch.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style was simplistic and repetitive, which made the book feel boring at times. It seemed more suited for a younger audience, though the presence of profanity and explicit sex scenes contradicted this impression.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked depth and development. The protagonist, Ash, was portrayed as an “angsty, angry teen,” which felt inconsistent with his supposed age of 18. His actions, thoughts, and attitudes often made him seem much younger, around 11 years old. Additionally, he was overly powerful compared to others, which diminished the stakes and made him feel unrealistically special.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was adequate when it came to magic and alchemy, with detailed discussions about their use. However, the broader setting and world were underdeveloped and never fully explored. The inclusion of modern elements like photographs and trains without explanation created confusion, as the world felt like a traditional fantasy without clear parameters.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was basic and followed familiar fantasy tropes, such as a quest for a legendary artifact, an evil antagonist, and an overpowered protagonist overcoming all odds.

This approach is refreshing and adds depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Diversity and Relationships:**  \n  The characters are diverse and avoid stereotypical tropes, such as the \"chosen one\" falling for the first person they meet. The growing relationship between Ash and Ramsay is well-developed and adds emotional depth to the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing feels uneven, with the majority of the book moving slowly and the ending feeling rushed. This imbalance leaves several questions unanswered, making it unclear if the story is intended to be a standalone or part of a series.\n\n- **Consistency and Detail:**  \n  There are inconsistencies in the threaded details, which can make it difficult to follow certain aspects of the plot. However, these issues do not overshadow the overall enjoyment of the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Infinity Alchemist* is a solid and enjoyable read, offering a fresh take on the fantasy genre with its unique magic system, diverse characters, and engaging premise. While the pacing and consistency could be improved, the novel stands out as a breath of fresh air amidst other fantasy works. It’s a great choice for readers looking for something different.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This fast-paced and engaging story captivates both young and older readers alike. It centers on Ash, a young orphaned trans teen who discreetly practices alchemy while working as a groundskeeper at an elite college. When discovered by Ramsay Thorne, Ash is thrust into a quest to locate a mythical book of immense power. The narrative is both fun and thought-provoking, making it a compelling read.",
            "Ash is a relatable protagonist with aspirations of studying alchemy and mending his strained relationship with his father. The story unfolds a touching and dramatic queer romance involving a polyamorous throuple: Ash, Ramsay Thorne—who transitions genders daily—and Ramsay's ex-boyfriend, Callum. The heartwarming chosen family dynamic among these three characters, all carrying the weight of traumatic childhoods, adds depth and richness to their journey.",
            "The writing is compelling and captures the vibrant energy of its youthful characters. The tone skillfully balances drama, romance, and thought-provoking themes.",
            "This story celebrates queer polyamory and delves into the concept of \"gender magic,\" where low-level alchemy enables individuals to non-verbally express their current gender identity. It confronts difficult questions about power dynamics and the ethics of ends justifying means. Additionally, the narrative handles sensitive topics such as grooming and abuse with care.",
            "The book has a youthful tone, straddling the line between middle grade and young adult, but its portrayal of polyamorous relationships may pose challenges for both audiences. The writing and characters are distinctly youthful, centering on teens navigating intense emotions and moral complexities for the first time, each carrying their own burdens."

        "conclusion": "*Infinity Alchemist* is a fast-paced, fun, and thought-provoking romantasy that blends youthful energy with complex themes. While its polyamorous representation makes it hard to categorize by age group, its engaging characters, queer normalization, and exploration of power dynamics make it a rewarding read for both young and older audiences.",

            "The plot felt lackluster until the final 100 pages, which seemed almost written by a different author. The action intensified, the dialogue sharpened, and there was a noticeable shift from telling to showing. By the end, I was thoroughly engaged.",
            "Callum's deep-seated desire to improve himself for his father, coupled with his resentment of his father's ways, feels authentic. Ash's anger clearly stems from his need for recognition, aligning well with his character. Meanwhile, Ramsey's isolated life and limited friendships may explain her perceived immaturity. Additionally, she struggles with the legacy of her murderous parents, a traumatic burden that certainly impacts her adolescent development.\n\nI found elements of myself in all the characters, fostering a strong connection with them. Their vivid personalities made the book engaging, compensating for a somewhat lackluster plot until the final 100 pages. I appreciated the representation of gender fluidity and transgender individuals, though I was puzzled by Ramsey's ability to change genders. Is it a curse? If Ramsey can transform physically, why can’t Ash seek an alchemist to affirm his gender? Perhaps I missed an important explanation.\n\nThe polyamorous relationship portrayed was heartwarming, filled with romance that brought both giggles and swoons. The open communication among the three characters was commendable and beautiful. It’s rare to find romance novels where all parties are mutually in love, which greatly enhanced my rating.",

Despite the absence of explicit sexual content, the mention and description of sex suggest a more mature audience. It could serve as an excellent introduction to fantasy romance for beginners.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the representation of gender fluidity and transgender characters, though I was perplexed by Ramsey's ability to switch genders. Is it a curse? If Ramsey's body can transform, why can't Ash seek an alchemist to affirm his gender? Perhaps I missed a crucial explanation.  \n  The polyamorous relationship was endearing, with charming romance that elicited giggles and swoons. The open communication among the three characters was commendable and beautiful. It's rare to find romance novels where all three parties are mutually in love, which significantly contributed to my rating.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Some reviews criticized the characters for being immature, but as a high school senior, I found their behavior relatable. Many books portray teenagers as if they're well into their twenties.  \n  - Callum's deep-rooted desire to be better for his father while resenting his father's ways felt authentic.  \n  - Ash's anger, I believe, stems from his desire to be acknowledged, which aligns with his character.  \n  - Ramsey leads a secluded life with few friends, which could explain her perceived immaturity. She also grapples with the legacy of her murderous parents, a traumatic experience that would undoubtedly affect a teenager's development.  \n  I saw parts of myself in all the characters and felt a deep understanding of them. Their strong personalities made the book engaging, compensating for the somewhat lackluster plot until the final 100 pages.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt lackluster until the final 100 pages, which seemed to be written by a completely different author.

The introduction of a potential polyamorous triad with Callum was also handled well, showcasing openness and acceptance among the characters.  \n\n- **Concept vs. Execution:**  \n  The concept of the book was compelling, but the execution fell short for me. The world-building and societal corruption were intriguing, but the cluttered narrative and uneven pacing detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I recognize that I am not the target age demographic for this book, but I’m unsure if that would have significantly changed my issues with the pacing and character development.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Infinity Alchemist* had a strong concept and commendable representation of queerness, the uneven pacing, frustrating characters, and cluttered execution made it a less satisfying read for me. I hope the book finds its intended audience and look forward to exploring Kacen Callendar’s other works, which I’ve heard great things about.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "*Infinity Alchemist* excels in representation, featuring bi/pansexual, polyamorous, trans, and gender-fluid characters. These identities are seamlessly woven into the story, creating a natural sense of inclusion that will resonate with many young adult readers. A highlight of the novel is Ash's character development; his journey of self-realization is skillfully portrayed, and his interactions in the final chapters are both fitting and impactful. The romantic buildup is handled exceptionally well, progressing naturally and satisfying readers’ expectations. The story leans heavily into the fantasy romance genre, with the romance being a central element. Although there are some heated scenes, they skillfully fade to black before becoming explicit, making them appropriate for upper YA audiences."

            "I appreciate the representation of polyamory in YA literature, as it’s always refreshing to see it explored. However, the romance often felt overwhelming, especially when I was more engaged with the magic system and overall plot. It took me a while to invest in Ash and Ramsay's relationship, as their banter initially came across as too hostile, leaving me uncertain about why I should support them. In contrast, Callum, introduced later, won me over almost instantly. Moreover, the jealousy subplot within the polyamorous dynamic was reminiscent of some unpleasant personal experiences, which detracted from the romance for me. While there was a surprising amount of sexual content for a YA book, it was presented in a light and non-intrusive manner. I wonder if my age played a role in my perspective on this story.",

It follows Ash, a trans man aspiring to become an alchemist in a world where alchemy is controlled by the elite and punishable by death. After being rejected from alchemy school, Ash teams up with Ramsay, a sarcastic genderfluid alchemist, to search for the Book of Source in exchange for alchemy lessons. The narrative delves into a hierarchical society filled with political turmoil, elitism, and propaganda against alchemists. The world-building is captivating, particularly the concept of Source—the energy binding all life, integral to both alchemy and religion.",

The queer representation is authentic, especially in the way Ash and Ramsay engage in discussions about gender identity that connect to their understanding of Source. However, the evolution of Ash’s romantic feelings seems rushed, shifting from attraction to love too swiftly.",

This symbolic approach enriches the narrative."

The lack of emotional connection with the characters and the confusing magic system made it difficult for me to stay engaged. I may revisit it in the future, but for now, I had to put it down.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book concludes in a satisfying manner, yet it serves as the first installment in a series, paving the way for future developments. The plot evolves into a frantic quest to find a book before others, heightened by the pursuit of an assassin and law enforcement, infusing the narrative with tension and urgency.",
            "In this gripping tale, Ramsay, Ash, and Callum—initially foes—grapple with complex emotions shaped by their shared histories and fears of abandonment. While the narrative largely unfolds through Ash’s eyes, flashbacks to Ramsay’s childhood and chapters from the assassin’s perspective enrich the story, revealing the motivations behind their rivalries and heightening the plot's tension.",
            "As a chemistry undergraduate, I have a strong preference for a rigorous approach to alchemy, expecting elements like precise measurements, careful ingredient combinations, and controlled reactions. However, this book presents an energy-based system that enables any action, which felt disappointing and did not meet my expectations for alchemy.",
            "Initially, I struggled to engage with the book, possibly due to fatigue and jet lag. However, around the 100-page mark, the story gained momentum, featuring more action sequences, explosions, and near-death experiences that ultimately captivated me."

        "conclusion": "INFINITY ALCHEMIST is a story of magic, action, and complex relationships that took some time to engage me but ultimately became compelling. While the magic system didn’t meet my expectations for alchemy, the character dynamics and high-stakes plot kept me invested. The ending feels satisfying yet leaves room for the story to evolve.",

However, around the 100-page mark, the story picked up significantly, with more action sequences, explosions, and near-death experiences that pulled me in.  \n  - The book becomes a desperate race to find a book before others do, with an assassin and the authorities in pursuit, adding tension and urgency.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - Ramsay, Ash, and Callum (an enemy-turned-maybe-ally) navigate complicated feelings for one another, influenced by their past histories and fears of abandonment.  \n  - The story is primarily told from Ash’s perspective, but it includes flashbacks to Ramsay’s childhood/adolescence and chapters from the assassin’s perspective, which provide insight into the enemies’ movements and add pressure to the plot.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  - As someone with a science background (studying chemistry at the undergraduate level), I prefer a harder magic system when it’s called “alchemy.” I expected precision measurements, combining chemicals/ingredients, and careful reaction conditions.  \n  - Instead, the book features an energy-to-do-anything system, which was disappointing and didn’t align with my expectations for alchemy.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  - The book ends in a way that feels complete, as if the story has reached its conclusion. However, it’s apparently the first in a series, leaving the slate clean for the second book to explore new directions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nINFINITY ALCHEMIST is a story of magic, action, and complex relationships that took some time to engage me but ultimately became compelling.

These identities are seamlessly integrated into the fantasy world, where they are accepted without question. The story addresses themes of power, oppression, and cruelty, but never in relation to someone's identity, which was refreshing to read.\n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance fell flat for me due to its lack of emotional depth and believability. The connection between the characters felt rushed and underdeveloped, with too much \"telling\" rather than \"showing.\" The relationships progressed too quickly, with characters declaring love for each other after only two weeks, making it difficult for me to empathize with their feelings. The pacing of the romance felt abrupt, jumping into the relationship without taking the reader along for the journey.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  While the fantasy world was intriguing, I wished for more detailed exploration. The story provided glimpses of the world outside the school, the individual Houses, the Source, and the Book of Source, but just as my curiosity was piqued, the narrative moved on. The world-building felt incomplete and could have benefited from more development to fully immerse the reader.\n\n- **Pacing and Finale:**  \n  The pacing of the story, particularly in the finale, felt rushed and condensed. The dramatic and revealing ending seemed hurried, as if it was squeezed into a specific page count. This detracted from the impact of the climax and left me wanting more depth and resolution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its shortcomings in romance development and world-building, the novel stands out for its inclusive representation of queer people of color and its intriguing fantasy elements.

While he experiences some growth throughout the story, it wasn't enough to satisfy me. In contrast, the supporting characters were standout elements of the book. Callum was delightful, Ramsey intriguing and multi-faceted, and Marlow emerged as the most compelling figure. I hope future installments delve deeper into her backstory, particularly her transition from the orphanage to working for Haine. \n\nThe LGBT+ representation was commendable, with sexual preferences depicted naturally and without excessive focus. However, I found the polyamorous relationship lacking; its complexities were not sufficiently explored, making it feel forced. Nonetheless, Ash's philosophical musings on love and energy did offer some context for embracing multiple relationships."

However, I wasn’t a fan of the polyamorous relationship, as its complexities weren’t adequately addressed, making it feel unnatural.

The book skillfully intertwines themes of gender fluidity with alchemical principles, featuring characters like Ramsay Thorne, whose identity and body fluctuate frequently, resulting in shifting pronouns throughout the narrative. Ash's quest for self-discovery is both engaging and poignant, as he grapples with a body that does not align with his true identity.",

The expectation for the characters to maintain a flawless, healthy connection didn't always align with their personalities or life circumstances. Additionally, some resolutions appeared rushed and disconnected from the characters' established traits. As prodigies achieving near-impossible feats with little struggle, Ash and Ramsay's successes lacked emotional weight. The primary challenges they encountered, such as hunger or fatigue, diminished the stakes, making their victories feel unsatisfying.

            "In this story, Ash serves as the central point-of-view character—an illegitimate child of a powerful Alchemist raised in secrecy. While I appreciated his representation as a trans character accepted by society without fanfare, I found him to be a difficult character to like. The romance between Ash and Ramsay occupies the first third of the book, followed by Ash's budding relationship with another character in the second third. Ultimately, the narrative evolves into a heartwarming polyamorous love story involving all three characters. \n\nNotably, the secondary characters are more compelling than Ash. I was particularly drawn to Ramsay, a talented Alchemist burdened by their parents’ dark legacy; Callum, Ramsay’s ex, who longs for a different life but struggles with fear; and Marlowe, the assassin employed by Ash’s father. I also wished for more depth regarding Ash’s parents. The book showcases a diverse cast, with societal inequalities rooted more in class and Alchemy than in race or sexuality, adding an intriguing layer to the story.",
            "I had high expectations for this book, but it didn't quite match them initially. Once I recognized it as a romantic fantasy, I began to enjoy it more. The fantasy elements, particularly a special book that grants power, play a background role, while the world-building—especially the societal structures and Alchemy—caught my interest. However, these elements weren't explored in depth. I appreciated unique aspects like Ramsay's gender fluidity linked to their connection to the source, but I wished for a more thorough examination. Although it’s marketed as a Young Adult novel, I believe it’s better suited for the older end of that demographic."

        "conclusion": "This romantic fantasy offers a unique blend of diverse characters and a polyamorous love story, but the fantasy elements and world-building take a backseat. While the secondary characters are compelling, the main character, Ash, is less engaging. The book’s exploration of class and Alchemy-based inequalities, along with its natural inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes, stands out. However, it feels more suited to older Young Adult readers.",

Once I realized it was a romantic fantasy, I did enjoy it.\n\n- **Main Character (Ash):**  \n  Ash is the main point-of-view character, the illegitimate child of a powerful Alchemist forced to learn Alchemy in bitter secret. However, he is a difficult character to like. I appreciated that he is trans and is simply accepted by society without explanation—this felt natural and refreshing.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Ash and Ramsay dominates the first third of the book. In the second third, the focus shifts to a romance between Ash and another character. By the final third, the story evolves into a sweet polyamorous love story involving all three characters.\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The fantasy aspect, centered around a special book that grants power, plays a background role. I found the world-building and societal elements—such as the houses and Alchemy—more fascinating, but they were not explored in depth. Unique features, like Ramsay’s gender fluidity due to their connection to the source, were touched upon but lacked detailed exploration.\n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  The secondary characters are more nuanced and interesting than Ash. I was particularly invested in Ramsay, a gifted Alchemist living under the shadow of their parents’ heinous crime; Callum, Ramsay’s ex who is desperate for a different life but too scared to pursue it; and Marlowe, the assassin working for Ash’s father. I would have loved to spend more time with Ash’s parents as well.\n\n- **Diversity and Themes:**  \n  The book features a diverse range of characters, with societal inequalities based more on class and Alchemy rather than race and sexuality.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  While marketed as a Young Adult novel, I believe it is more suitable for the older end of that age range.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis romantic fantasy offers a unique blend of diverse characters and a polyamorous love story, but the fantasy elements and world-building take a backseat. While the secondary characters are compelling, the main character, Ash, is less engaging. The book’s exploration of class and Alchemy-based inequalities, along with its natural inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes, stands out.

The narrative delves into the connections among alchemists, highlighting their shared histories and illustrating how their abilities are intertwined with love and their capacity to connect with both Source and one another. The societal divide into factions—pro- and anti-alchemy—adds significant depth to the protagonists' journeys of self-discovery."

Initially, I was concerned that the book’s focus on non-binary, trans, and LGBTQ+ characters might prioritize messaging over storytelling.

The three main characters have different gender identities, which are presented naturally without over-explanation, reflecting real-life diversity.  \n\n- **Themes and Intellectual Depth:**  \n  The book explores thought-provoking concepts that could spark discussions on modern societal, political, and social issues. It has the potential to serve as a foundation for intellectual conversations, making it a compelling choice for academic settings.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The narration was a drawback, as it lacked emotional inflection, making the characters feel muted and less believable. This significantly impacted the story’s likability. I would recommend reading the physical book over listening to the audiobook.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal and Genre Fit:**  \n  The book is an engaging YA fantasy read with a familiar yet enjoyable concept. While the fantasy setting isn’t groundbreaking, the characters and their representation stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is worth reading for its strong representation, intellectual depth, and engaging characters, though the audiobook narration falls short. It’s a solid choice for fans of YA fantasy, especially those who appreciate diverse and thought-provoking storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️ (rounded up)"

            "In this story, Ash's motivations remain unclear, particularly regarding his swift attraction to Ramsey. It seems unrealistic that he would readily accept Ramsey's claims about blackmailing him for the sake of saving the world without any skepticism. Instead of questioning Ramsey’s coercion, Ash prioritizes his bond with Ramsey over everything else he values. \n\nIn contrast, I found myself more aligned with Callum, whose motivations are clearer: his enduring feelings for Ramsey, his willingness to embrace his feelings for Ash, and his internal conflict about wielding power he doesn’t want to harm others. Ash’s access to Ramsey’s loving memories of Callum adds some depth, but I struggled to understand how coercion could evolve into a love that saves the universe. Ultimately, the character connections overshadow the plot, and I preferred the Ash/Callum dynamic, which felt more authentic and emotionally impactful than the relationship between Ash and Ramsey.",

It felt unrealistic that he would believe Ramsey’s claims about blackmailing him to save the world without questioning them. Instead of doubting Ramsey’s coercion, Ash chose his connection with Ramsey over everything else he cared about.  \n  I connected more with Callum, as his motivations were clearer: his long-term feelings for Ramsey, his openness to loving Ash, and his struggle with using power he didn’t want against others.

            "In this story, the protagonist, Ash, grapples with systemic barriers and confronts the dismissive attitudes of the privileged elite. However, toward the end, there's a moment that seems to undercut his struggles, suggesting that the privileged may have been correct in advising him to “visualize his power better.” This feels contradictory and could weaken the book's critique of systemic oppression.

While the setting is functional, it lacks the richness and detail that could make it more immersive.\n\n- **Magic System (Alchemy):**  \n  The alchemical magic system has two main issues. First, it’s not well-defined and primarily revolves around energy blasts, scrying, and teleportation. While these elements are not inherently bad, they limit the system’s complexity. However, the novel does innovate by exploring plot twists enabled by teleportation, scrying, memory transmission, and emotional empathy, giving it a feel reminiscent of a high-level D&D campaign.  \n  Second, the system struggles to balance its dual metaphorical roles: representing class privilege and queerness under religious fundamentalism. These two implications often clash, making the metaphor feel inconsistent and underdeveloped.\n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  The main character, Ash, spends much of the book confronting systemic barriers and challenging the dismissive attitudes of the privileged elite. However, near the end, there’s a moment that seems to undermine Ash’s struggles by suggesting that the privileged characters might have been right about his need to “visualize his power better.” This feels contradictory and potentially undermines the book’s critique of systemic oppression. It’s unclear whether this is an intentional narrative choice or an unfortunate implication of the book’s spiritual themes.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The novel incorporates a “hippie woo-woo, we are all one, manifest-your-reality” spiritual element, which adds a unique flavor but also introduces problematic undertones.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Representation and Diversity:**  \n  - The book features great queer representation, with Ash, the main character, being Black and trans. I appreciated the casual references to his binder and his feelings of dysmorphia.  \n  - There is also a genderfluid love interest, and I liked how the author, Callender, paid attention to her pronouns.  \n  - The story explores the idea of love, showing that multiple kinds of love exist and that it’s possible to feel romantic love towards more than one person.\n\n- **Character Development and Decision-Making:**  \n  - The characters don’t always make the best decisions, but their reasoning makes sense given their age and who they are. They feel authentic as teenagers navigating their world.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The plot centers around a quest for an object, and along the way, we learn about the world. While I initially enjoyed Callender’s take on alchemy and magic, the pacing started to drag, which made me focus on the holes in the worldbuilding.  \n  - As an adult reader, I found these issues noticeable, but I recognize that they might not be as significant for the intended teenage audience.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - The audiobook was narrated by Wes Haas, and I really enjoyed the performance. It seems to be their first audiobook, and I hope to hear more from them in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I hoped, likely due to not being in the intended age range, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to teenagers. The representation, character authenticity, and exploration of love are strong points, even if the pacing and worldbuilding didn’t fully resonate with me as an adult reader. The audiobook narration was a highlight, and I look forward to hearing more from Wes Haas.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the plot's concept. The blend of alchemy in a YA fantasy setting was captivating, especially since I don’t often read this genre but have a strong affinity for alchemy.",
            "This book excels in representation, featuring a trans main character, a genderfluid side character, and a polyamorous relationship. I particularly appreciated the nuanced portrayal of gender, which aligned with my desire for individuals to express their true selves and for others to embrace that authenticity. The protagonist, Ash, embodies the quintessential hotheaded YA character. While I liked him, I found myself more fascinated by the flawed characters grappling with their emotions during a crisis, which added depth to the story. The angsty romance is engaging, with characters struggling to communicate their feelings; however, I was more invested in the world-building and often wished the romance didn’t take center stage.",

Given the author's experience, I expected a more intricate and surprising storyline that transcended easy shortcuts.",

Ash embodies the essence of our house cats that cozy up in bed with their owners and partners, seamlessly becoming a part of the relationship. Additionally, the choice of the name Ash is particularly clever, symbolizing a rebirth or transformation—much like rising from the ashes at the story's conclusion.",
            "The concept of the worldbuilding is intriguing—almost like magic with a twist. However, it often feels like only an idea rather than a fully realized setting. I found myself longing for deeper immersion, as there were many aspects I wanted to explore further. Given the book's length, there was ample opportunity to develop key elements, yet it occasionally prioritized less significant details instead.",

Most times I didn’t feel immersed in the world, and there’s so much I wanted to know more about. A book this length had enough space to take its time on important things, but it sometimes focused too much on the wrong things.  \n- **Plot Development:** The plot lacked a lot. The story often went in the direction of the easy way out. As someone who writes myself, I know how hard it is to go from A to B in a story. This author is an experienced writer, so they should be able to avoid relying on cheap ways out and make the plot more complex and surprising.  \n- **Engagement:** I still really enjoyed the read and will probably give the next book a try. However, I’d like to be surprised more and given something to nibble my fingernails over, rather than having a solution at hand two pages later.  \n- **Character Detail (Ash):** Ash is the representation of all our house cats that sleep with us owners and their partners in their beds, sprawled on top, and we all silently agree that they’re just part of our relationship. Also, naming him Ash, considering the end of the book, is clever—like Ash risen from the ashes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel for its humor, diverse characters, and unique magic system.

I'm hoping I was right in thinking, \"the last time you saw Ramsay/how they presented is not the pronouns they're using today.\"  \n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I had to force myself to get through it, as I hate starting a book and abandoning it. There were many moments where my roommate watched me open and close the cover, and I would often tell them how much of a fight it was to keep reading.  \n- **Recommendation and Re-read Potential:**  \n  This definitely would not be something I'd recommend for someone who doesn't have patience, and it's not something I'd reread again. If it gets a sequel, because the ending felt like a huge book 2 nudge, I probably won't end up picking it up.  \n- **Overall Sentiment:**  \n  I really wish I enjoyed this book more than I did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise with its high fantasy, LGBTQIA+, and polyamorous themes, the slow pacing, editorial errors, and confusion around character representation made it a struggle to finish.

However, I felt the narrator didn’t differentiate between characters well enough, making it difficult to identify who was speaking most of the time.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  While I wasn’t the biggest fan of this book, I recognize that I may not be the target audience. There are definitely others who will love it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book to be a mixed experience. While the world-building and magic system were intriguing, the unlikable protagonist and uneven pacing made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the story. The audiobook production was solid, though the narration could have been more distinct. I believe this book will resonate more with its intended audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nActual rating: 3.5 stars"

            "I appreciated all three main characters, but some aspects of their development felt forced. The protagonist, Ash, is transgender, yet the author often reiterates his use of a binder, which became tedious and detracted from the narrative. Additionally, Ramsey’s character is portrayed as both male and female throughout the story without clear transitions, creating confusion for readers. Using they/them pronouns for Ramsey could have streamlined the narrative and focused on character development instead. Ultimately, the author’s intention to represent the LGBTQ+ community seems to overshadow the story itself.",

Once I got through the first quarter of the book, I began to feel comfortable in it. In the beginning, it is easy to feel thrown into something with little to no explanation.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world created is elaborate and interesting.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked all three of the main characters, though I felt some of their character writing to be forced. The main character, Ash, is trans, and instead of letting this be just who he is, the author feels the need every few pages to tell the reader he is wearing a binder. This made it start to feel tedious and took away from the story. Additionally, the gender swapping in the way Ramsey is written makes it difficult to read through the book. Ramsey is written as both male and female throughout the book and switches without any reference or point. It takes away from the character and the story to constantly be trying to figure out who is being talked about when Ramsey could have easily been written using they/them pronouns.\n\n- **Representation and Storytelling:**  \n  In some ways, I feel that the author's desire to represent the LGBT community in this book took away from the actual story that was trying to be told.\n\n- **Series Potential vs. Standalone:**  \n  I can see that the author has the intention of making this a series, but I believe it succeeds better as a single book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the story is interesting with an elaborate world, but the pacing and character development could be improved. The representation of the LGBT community, while commendable, sometimes detracted from the narrative. The book works better as a standalone rather than part of a series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They form a found family and a love triad where nobody has to choose, which I found incredibly compelling. The portrayal of their relationships and how their love blooms is super enjoyable, especially with the fade-to-black approach that keeps it YA-friendly.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building, particularly around the houses and magic systems, feels underdeveloped. I initially thought all characters were alchemists, but it turns out they have different streams of magic, and most seem to hate alchemists while still using alchemy. This inconsistency left me confused, and I wish the other types of magic had been explored in more detail.  \n\n- **Pacing and Setting:**  \n  The pacing is excellent, with a good balance between academy life and travel settings that keeps the story fresh and engaging.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The queer representation is spectacular and adds a lot of depth and inclusivity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story leans heavily on romance towards the end, which I enjoyed, but the big fight scene felt a bit anticlimactic. However, it’s clear that the fight has only just begun, leaving room for future developments.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Despite its imperfections, the writing is engaging and kept me hooked throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some flaws, particularly in world-building and the climax, the strong characters, engaging writing, and excellent queer representation made it a giant hit for me.

The pacing is uneven, particularly in the audio version; some sections drag on while the ending feels rushed. The book’s length, exceeding 400 pages, exacerbates these pacing issues.",

The evolution of a love triangle into a polyamorous relationship is a refreshing take, especially in YA literature, where polyamory is seldom explored. The characters are culturally diverse and engaging; however, Ash's personality can be quite grating at times. His persistent \"woe is me\" attitude felt repetitive and detracted from my enjoyment. A better balance in his character development would have greatly improved the narrative.",

Although he can’t attend the prestigious Alchemy school, he manages to secure a job on the grounds, where he endures mockery from wealthy students. Ramsay, shaped by their parents' notoriety, is an intriguing character whose genderfluid identity adds depth—switching between he and she pronouns.

Through their interactions, Ash's vulnerability and frustration are strikingly palpable.",

I love that they're all so mean to each other because of the environments the characters live in. I love how they've all learned to act in certain ways specifically based on how they were raised. I like how Ash and Ramsay are literally so mean to each other at the start, and that they aren't both perfect. I also appreciate how Callum has a good reason for what happened between him and Ramsay, but he doesn't act like he doesn't deserve their anger.\n\n- **Plot and Magic System:**  \n  I really liked the plot. A lot of people didn't like the magic system, but I think the magic coming from the mind was really fun.\n\n- **Representation:**  \n  I was so excited when I saw that Ash was trans! I'm trans myself, and was super excited to see a trans character!\n\n- **Romance and Sensual Content:**  \n  The only parts I didn't really like were the romance or when it gets a little spicy since that's not really my preference. However, I can ignore it because I liked the rest of the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book despite some minor dislikes. The flawed characters, engaging plot, unique magic system, and meaningful representation made it a standout read for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The first half of the book felt like it took forever (though maybe that’s because I only listened to it occasionally before listening almost every day for the last half). Unfortunately, after hours of buildup, the ending seemed so rushed and lackluster. I was sort of left confused as to how the book wrapped up when I had less than an hour of a 13-hour audiobook left, and the climax and the ending took place in that hour.  \n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  I’m just starting to get into audiobooks, so I can’t judge the narrator too much, but I thought they did a great job!  \n- **Character Engagement:**  \n  I love Ramsay—what can I say?  \n- **Interest in Sequel:**  \n  I will definitely be listening to the sequel when it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this fantasy novel, particularly for its queer representation and engaging characters like Ramsay.

However, the world-building and magic system lack depth and clarity, which might be a drawback for readers who enjoy fully fleshed-out settings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The depiction of polyamory was also commendable, capturing the complex emotions that come with it. The three main characters, each flawed, undergo compelling redemption arcs. While there were moments when they became unlikable, their motivations garnered sympathy, making them relatable. Some secondary characters started off evoking empathy, but I found that sentiment waned by the story’s conclusion.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  - The novel is set in 1920's America with a fantasy twist, featuring a scientific study of magic.  \n  - The premise includes a critique of academia, which adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - The queer characters and polyamorous relationship between the three romantic leads are complex, sweet, and believable.  \n  - Themes of religious trauma and parental issues (mommy/daddy issues) are explored, adding emotional layers to the characters.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Plot Development:**  \n  - The worldbuilding and character backgrounds feel underdeveloped for much of the story, only becoming crucial during the climax.  \n  - The ending, while satisfying, feels rushed and could have benefited from being expanded into two books.  \n\n- **Sequel Setup:**  \n  - The last page hints at a sequel, but the setup feels inconsistent with the established narrative, leaving a sense of disconnect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of fantasy, romance, and social critique, with a setting and themes that resonate deeply. While the relationships are well-crafted and engaging, the worldbuilding and pacing could have been more evenly developed. The rushed ending and awkward sequel setup slightly detract from an otherwise enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The combination of magical schools, alchemy, and an enemies-to-lovers romance made it a standout story. If you enjoy these elements, I highly recommend checking it out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a captivating blend of magic, alchemy, and romance, set in a unique and immersive world.

Overall, it was a disappointing and tedious read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a very low rating (e.g., 1/5 or 2/5)."

The ending was particularly unsatisfying, but I remain hopeful for future books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

That said, I loved the relationships so much that I devoured the book anyway.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI absolutely loved this book!

While it’s obvious the main character is overpowered, the rules felt very loose and inconsistent. Alchemy, in particular, was portrayed as something powerful and hard to grasp, yet it seemed like everyone was doing it without much difficulty.  \n\n- **Representation of Gender Fluidity:**  \n  Ramsay’s gender fluidity was incorporated naturally into the world, which I appreciated. However, the use of switching pronouns (she/he) often left me confused about who was being referred to or speaking. Additionally, characters outside the main trio sometimes used incorrect or inconsistent pronouns, which felt clunky and disrupted the flow.  \n\n- **Queer Representation:**  \n  While queerness wasn’t made into an issue for the characters, it felt very isolated. There was no mention of queer characters outside the main trio, which made the representation feel limited and disconnected from the broader world.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plotlines:**  \n  The introduction and subsequent dismissal of the best friend character at the beginning felt questionable and underdeveloped. I also didn’t care for the assassin plotline, which didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships:**  \n  I really enjoyed the building of the relationship between Ash and Ramsay, but it was awkwardly cut off by plot reasons around the 45% mark, which left me feeling disconnected from the story. Additionally, openly indicating in the book summary that there would be polyamorous romance for the main character took away the intrigue and appreciation for how those dynamics could have developed naturally.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I really wanted to love this book, I found it difficult to fully engage with due to inconsistencies in the magic system, clunky handling of gender fluidity, and isolated queer representation.

They all had their flaws, but this actually made them more likable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book and appreciated its exploration of love and its well-developed characters, the integration of certain elements felt disjointed, and the pacing and transitions could have been smoother.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, once he matured, he became essential to maintaining peace and bringing the relationship together.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had a really fun time reading this adventure.

However, as an 18-year-old navigating complex situations alongside 19-year-olds Callum and Ramsey, Ash's behavior sometimes feels more juvenile than expected. I would have appreciated more time spent developing their relationships, as much of this growth occurs in passing, with Ash briefly noting the progression of his feelings for Callum and Ramsey. On a positive note, the queer, trans, and genderfluid representation is exceptional. I was particularly drawn to Ramsey from the start; his character is captivating, and I hope to see more from his perspective in future books. He has the potential to become one of my all-time favorite characters.",

In theory, it's absolutely everything I could want from a book—academic setting, alchemy, queer and trans characters who I genuinely fell in love with and would die for.  \n- **Tone and Genre Consistency:**  \n  The tone and genre just did not do it for me. This seemed to swing very wildly from young YA to more mature, bordering-on-adult YA every other chapter. I think I would have enjoyed this book much more if it felt more solidly like YA or adult.  \n- **Character Development and Decisions:**  \n  The decisions Ash, the main character, makes are largely rooted in anger and impulsivity. I didn't necessarily hate that, as it's a very teenage thing to do. However, Ash is 18, and both Callum and Ramsey are 19, and all three of them are navigating incredibly complex situations and feelings, so having Ash act more like a teenager rather than the young adult he is was at times very jarring.  \n- **Relationship Development:**  \n  I would have loved to spend more time with these characters and see their relationship grow and develop. A lot of the relationship development was done very offhandedly, with Ash just mentioning that time was passing and he was starting to get closer to Callum and Ramsey.  \n- **Representation:**  \n  The queer, trans, genderfluid representation was just spectacular. For me in particular, I was attached to Ramsey pretty much immediately. He was incredible, and I can only hope that in future books we get more of his POV. I'm pretty confident he could very easily become one of my favorite characters of all time.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  This was one of those books where I think I liked the potential of the story more than the story itself. That being said, I did absolutely adore all three of them (and Marlowe, I love Marlowe so much), as individual characters and as a part of a trio. I really hope to see more books with these characters in the future!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved the concept, characters, and representation, the inconsistent tone and genre, along with the rushed relationship development, kept me from fully enjoying the book. However, I remain hopeful for future installments that explore these characters further.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author’s Reputation and Expectations:**  \n  Kacen Callender is an author I’ll always take a chance on, especially when they write a magical polyamory book. While *Infinity Alchemist* wasn’t their strongest work, what I enjoyed about it outweighed some of the issues I had.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The main character, Ash, is forbidden by law from practicing alchemy, as only the wealthy elite have the resources to attend school and obtain a formal license. He takes a job as a groundskeeper at Lancaster Mage's College and studies in secret. After being caught by Ramsey Thorne, an alchemical protege and apprentice, the two enter into a pact: Ash won’t be reported to the law if he helps Ramsay find the Book of Source.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The novel excels in its romantic relationships and character work. The main cast is incredibly diverse, and their identities are written with care. Ash, the protagonist, is deeply flawed—some readers may find him annoying—but the recurring theme in Callender’s work is that everyone deserves love, care, and equitable treatment, even when they act out or make mistakes. I loved all three protagonists dearly.  \n\n- **Polyamory Representation:**  \n  The polyamory representation is a highlight, though I wish the novel weren’t limited by the space constraints of YA, as the relationships could have had more room to breathe. For teenagers, the main cast is shockingly (and unrealistically) good at resolving conflicts that can arise in polyamorous relationships. However, I appreciated that the novel still showcased some of the difficulties that come with it.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The fantasy plot and worldbuilding didn’t offer many new insights into the genre and sometimes detracted from the novel’s strength, which was character development and relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt very unbalanced, to the point where I wasn’t always eager to pick up the book during certain sections.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Infinity Alchemist* is flawed, but its strengths in character development and relationships make it worth reading for those who prioritize these aspects. If you’re looking for a groundbreaking fantasy read, this might not be the best choice. However, I’ll be continuing with the series, hopeful that the second book will hit its stride now that much of the setup is out of the way.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I appreciated the dynamic among the characters as a throuple, the individual introductions of the love interests left their development feeling somewhat incomplete.",

            "The world-building in the story felt lacking, with ambiguous political structures and unclear levels of alchemy. While this may suit a YA audience, it fell short of my expectations as an adult fantasy reader. The magic system presented both strengths and weaknesses; the expansive ability to conjure almost anything led to some plot holes and convenient resolutions. However, I found the detail of base-tier magic being linked to existence and breathing to be quite charming."

There was a noticeable issue of \"showing, not telling,\" which affected the overall narrative depth.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was on the weaker side, with vague notions of political structure and alchemy levels. However, I acknowledge that this level of world-building might be appropriate for a YA novel, even if it didn’t fully meet my preferences as an adult fantasy reader.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system had both strengths and weaknesses. The concept of conjuring anything with few limitations felt too broad and led to plot holes and conveniences. However, I appreciated the detail of the base tier of magic being tied to existence and breathing, which I found charming.  \n\n- **Genre Innovation:**  \n  The novel doesn’t push the boundaries of the fantasy genre, lacking a mind-bending magic system or intricate plot. However, it excels in introducing a diverse cast of characters, which is a standout feature.  \n\n- **Character Representation:**  \n  The representation of diverse characters, particularly Ramsay’s genderfluid identity and pronoun usage, was handled exceptionally well. It was clear and thoughtfully executed, which I found impressive.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was a highlight of the novel, offering a fun, inclusive, and refreshing take on a love triangle.
