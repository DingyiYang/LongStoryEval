However, this kind of fell flat for me.\n\n- **Anthology Structure and Theme:**\n   - The book starts with an introduction of a mysterious auntie who appears in all the stories, either saving the day or nudging the main character in the right direction with a little \"magic.\"\n\n- **Individual Story Evaluations:**\n   - **\"The Disaster Wedding\" by Prerna Pickett:** This was the best story in the anthology for me. The concept of a family curse and the main character's ability to will things into happening by speaking them aloud was intriguing. Despite causing problems during the wedding week, she manages to achieve a happy ending.\n   - **\"A Wedding Recipe for Disaster\" by Sarah Mughal Rana:** This story about a bride torn between her parents' choice and her own secret love was also enjoyable.\n   - **Other Stories:** Most of the other stories were fine but not particularly memorable.\n   - **\"Sehra\" by Syed Masood and \"The Wedding Biryani\" by Noreen Mughees:** These stories were not to my liking.\n   - **\"A Very Bloody Kayanam\" by Anahita Karthik:** I couldn't finish this story, stopping just 5 pages in. The mix of myth, desi tradition, and fantasy elements like vampires and blood bonding felt out of place and unappealing.\n\n- **Appeal to Target Audience:**\n   - For readers interested in exploring various desi wedding traditions, religions, and rituals, this anthology might be a good fit.\n\n- **Personal Preference and Future Reading Plans:**\n   - I plan to check out a couple of novels by my favorite authors from this anthology instead of revisiting the collection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I had high hopes for this anthology, it didn't fully meet my expectations.

The shorter length might have contributed, but I believe it’s due to the strong lineup of authors and my love for weddings.\n\n- **Individual Story Evaluations:**\n   - **The Disaster Wedding by Prerna Pickett (✨️✨️✨️.5):**  \n     I found this story cute, especially the magical realism aspect where the MC and her family can speak things into existence. I related to her spiraling over potentially ruining her sister’s wedding.\n   - **A Cynic at a Shaadi by Aamna Qureshi (✨️✨️✨️):**  \n     I was excited for this story due to Aamna’s marketing skills, and it didn’t disappoint. However, Raza’s persistence with Sajal felt off-putting at first, though he grew on me by the end. The story was okay but could have been better if longer.\n   - **Sehra by Syed Masood (✨️):**  \n     This story lacked romance, which was surprising for a YA romance anthology. Han’s stand against his parents was the only highlight.\n   - **Fate’s Favorites by Tashie Bhuiyan (✨️✨️✨️✨️):**  \n     One of my favorites! I loved the soulmate tattoo concept and how Tashie avoided the typical soulmate trope by having Nivali and Aman fall for each other without knowing they were soulmates. The jealousy scene was a great addition.\n   - **The Wedding Biryani by Noreen Mughees (✨️✨️✨️.5):**  \n     The LI’s name, Zayn Malik, was distracting, but I enjoyed the academic rivals-to-lovers dynamic. The story was cute, though the name choice felt odd.\n   - **A Confluence of Fates by Payal Doshi (✨️✨️✨️✨️):**  \n     I loved the second-chance romance and the angst, though I wished for more clarity on Jeh’s actions. The realistic ending was appreciated, even if it involved emotional cheating.\n   - **A Wedding Recipe for Disaster by Sarah Mughal Rana (✨️✨️✨️✨️.5):**  \n     My favorite story! The banter and mutual pining between Osama and Salama were excellent, even with minimal on-page interaction. The angst and hurt were palpable, and I’d love a full-length book about them.\n   - **A Very Bloody Kalyanam by Anahita Karthik (✨️✨️✨️.5):**  \n     A pleasant surprise! I enjoyed the second-chance vampire romance and how the bond felt genuine due to their pre-existing feelings. Kritik’s redemption was well done.\n\n- **Recurring Character (Auntie):**\n   - The auntie was a fun recurring character who tied the stories together, though her role felt uneven. She was better utilized in some stories (e.g., *A Wedding Recipe for Disaster* and *The Disaster Wedding*) than others, where her inclusion felt forced.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis anthology stood out to me due to its strong lineup of authors and wedding-themed stories. While some stories were more memorable than others, the overall quality was high, and I appreciated the variety of tropes and themes. The recurring auntie character added a unique touch, though her role could have been more consistent.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall: 3.25 stars  \n- Individual Story Ratings:  \n  - *The Disaster Wedding*: 3.5 stars  \n  - *A Cynic at a Shaadi*: 3 stars  \n  - *Sehra*: 1 star  \n  - *Fate’s Favorites*: 4 stars  \n  - *The Wedding Biryani*: 3.5 stars  \n  - *A Confluence of Fates*: 4 stars  \n  - *A Wedding Recipe for Disaster*: 4.5 stars  \n  - *A Very Bloody Kalyanam*: 3.5 stars"

I enjoyed being immersed in a variety of cultures that were new to me.  \n\n- **Favorite Story and Unique Concepts:**  \n  My favorite story by far was *Fates Favorites* by Tashie Bhuiyan. I would happily read a full-length rom-com about this world that she created. I loved the idea of soul-marks—they were a beautiful concept, and I was mesmerized by the story. I feel this could be expanded in so many different ways, and I hope Tashie Bhuiyan writes more in this universe.  \n\n- **Appreciation for Symbolism and Writing Style:**  \n  I also really enjoyed *Sehra* by Syed M. Masood. The symbolism and family traditions were nice touches, and I appreciated the writing style.  \n\n- **Critique of Repetitiveness and Lack of Uniqueness:**  \n  Unfortunately, the remaining stories fell flat. While romances are always full of clichés and tropes, there were very few unique twists, and it was challenging to tell most of the stories and characters apart. The majority of the stories were too similar, and the writing felt lacking.  \n\n- **Editorial Touch and Narrative Connection:**  \n  I did enjoy how the editor, Prerna Pickett, wove a small story through each short story. I had forgotten about the opening story and never expected it to come full circle. There is a connecting thread in all the stories, and I encourage readers to see if they can spot it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the anthology offered a mix of highs and lows.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Cultural Representation and Descriptions:**\n   - I really enjoyed hearing about all the numerous steps and traditions associated with Desi weddings.\n   - I was blown away by all the colors, beaded fabrics, and jewels that were described throughout the stories.\n   - The stories made me crave a ton of South Asian food I had never heard of before, as they were filled with vivid descriptions of food in the best possible way.\n\n- **Story Variety and Personal Preferences:**\n   - As is often the case with anthologies, I liked some stories better than others.\n   - My favorite stories were those that went beyond the typical narrative of a teenager dreaming of love and finding it during the wedding of an older sibling or cousin.\n   - While there’s nothing wrong with those types of stories, I felt I might be a bit too old to fully enjoy them.\n\n- **Favorite Stories:**\n   - My absolute favorite story was *Sehra* by Syed M. Masood, which follows a young Pakistani Muslim man who is disowned by his parents for marrying a non-Pakistani Christian woman. The story focuses on his brother’s struggle to find the courage to attend the wedding despite their parents' disapproval.\n   - Close seconds were:\n     - *A Confluence of Fates* by Payal Doshi, which takes place at a wedding held at the site of the Mumbai attacks. The story explores the bride’s younger sister’s budding relationship with a young man, while also reflecting on the significance of celebrating in a place of mourning and the issue of India’s \"brain drain\" as she contemplates studying abroad but vows to return.\n     - *A Wedding Recipe for Disaster* by Sarah Mughal Rana, a love story between two young people whose parents are rivals in the food industry, with one being Pashtun and the other Punjabi.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this anthology was a delightful read, offering a rich exploration of Desi wedding traditions, vibrant cultural details, and mouthwatering food descriptions. While I enjoyed some stories more than others, the standout tales provided deeper, more thought-provoking narratives that resonated with me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"
