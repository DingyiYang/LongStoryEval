            "The supernatural force driving the curse is insufficiently explained, leaving readers to infer its nature. Additionally, the use of short, present-tense chapters from an unclear narrator adds confusion and disrupts the narrative flow.",
            "In \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the characters are notably strong and well-defined. Arabella experiences profound character growth, aligning perfectly with her role as the Beast. Initially, Beau, the Beauty figure, is more likable, but both characters undergo significant evolution throughout the story. The secondary characters, such as Camille and the children, are also well-developed and leave a lasting impression.",
            "The story features a blend of realistic castle life and whimsical elements reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. However, the geographical and historical context is vague, particularly regarding the Pyrenees region and the pre-French Revolution timeline, which can lead to confusion. Inconsistencies in names and cultural details, such as Arabella's missing French surname and Beau’s mixed French-Spanish name with incorrect accents, detract from the overall experience. Additionally, inconsistencies in linguistic details, like missing tildes in Spanish names, further break immersion. Overall, the absence of a French surname for Arabella stands out as a significant oversight.",
            "The story honors the original tale's core theme while emphasizing characters' active pursuit of redemption. Emotional depth and character growth are central to the narrative.",
            "The author's fairy tale retellings are consistently imaginative and fresh. *Beastly Beauty* offers a uniquely original interpretation of the curse, while the Beauty-meets-Beast scene stands out as one of the most thrilling I've encountered. This gender-swapped retelling is truly among the best in its genre."

        "conclusion": "*Beastly Beauty* is a highly creative and emotionally engaging gender-swapped retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, with strong character development and an original take on the curse. However, it falls short of perfection due to unclear world-building, narrative inconsistencies, and occasional cultural inaccuracies. Despite these flaws, it remains a standout retelling and a personal favorite, earning 4.5 stars.",

She embodied elements of both the beast and Belle, infused with a feminist twist that felt natural and well-executed.

While the idea of symbolically representing depression and emotions is intriguing, it ultimately fails to resonate. The resolution is particularly unrealistic, as Arabella suddenly overcomes her struggles without any meaningful development. Furthermore, the logistics surrounding the curse—such as the interplay of emotions and the beast transformation—are confusing and inadequately explained. The arbitrary hundred-year timeline feels more like an afterthought than a vital part of the narrative.",
            "Arabella, the Beast character, is underdeveloped and lacks the expected qualities of a Beast in a Beauty and the Beast retelling. Her central character arc feels rushed and unconvincing, especially during the climax where her transformation occurs abruptly. Similarly, Beau, the male lead, is forgettable, his only redeeming trait being his love for his brother. The lack of depth in both characters makes it difficult to connect with or care about them. The romance between Beau and Arabella feels forced and lacks the necessary buildup; their minimal interactions result in almost nonexistent relationship development, which is particularly disappointing in a retelling where romance should take center stage.",

This mismatch in tone and content was disappointing, as it didn’t align with my expectations for a YA novel.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Arabella, the Beast character, is underdeveloped and lacks the \"Beastly\" qualities expected in a Beauty and the Beast retelling. Her character arc, which is central to the story, feels rushed and unconvincing, especially during the climax where her transformation happens abruptly.\n   - Beau, the male lead, is equally unremarkable, with his only redeeming quality being his love for his brother. The lack of depth in both main characters made it hard to connect with or care about them.\n\n- **Romance and Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - The romance between Beau and Arabella feels forced and lacks buildup. Their interactions are minimal, and their relationship development is almost nonexistent, which is particularly jarring in a Beauty and the Beast retelling where the romance should be a focal point.\n\n- **Plot Execution and Symbolism:**\n   - The plot, which combines elements of Beauty and the Beast and Inside Out, is poorly executed. The symbolic representation of depression and emotions is intriguing in concept but falls flat in execution. The resolution feels unrealistic, with Arabella instantly overcoming her struggles without meaningful development.\n   - The logistics of the curse, including the role of the emotions and the beast transformation, are confusing and poorly explained. The arbitrary inclusion of a hundred-year timeline feels tacked on rather than integral to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**\n   - The writing and dialogue come across as juvenile, which detracts from the story’s potential depth. The portrayal of emotions as cartoonish caricatures with silly anagrammed names further undermines the seriousness of the themes.\n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**\n   - Having read the author’s previous work, *Poisoned*, I noticed a reuse of certain plot devices that I didn’t enjoy. This repetition, combined with the juvenile execution, left me disappointed and questioning the consistency of the author’s storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *Beastly Beauty* had the potential to be a compelling retelling with its unique blend of Beauty and the Beast and Inside Out elements. However, the underdeveloped characters, forced romance, confusing plot logistics, and juvenile execution made it a frustrating read. While the symbolic themes of depression and emotional control were promising, they were not well-realized, leaving the story feeling contrived and unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n1.5 stars."

The writing style, lack of character connection, and mismatched plot structure made it difficult for me to continue reading, leading me to stop at page 53.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 16% (page 53)."

The twist at the end is well-executed; although I anticipated the identities of the court ladies early on, this did not diminish the overall value of the narrative.",
            "The character development in the story is outstanding. Each character, including the supporting cast, feels well-rounded rather than like mere extras. There isn't a conventional villain; instead, the true challenges stem from the fearsome beast and the emotional struggles the characters face. Both Beau and Belle are relatable and likable, making it easy to root for them from the beginning. While the romance leans slightly toward insta-love, which I found mildly problematic, I recognize that this element is also present in the original Disney movie. Therefore, I can't begrudge the author for maintaining this aspect.",

The ending fits this story much better than the original.  \n   - The twist at the end was well-executed, and while I guessed early on who the ladies of the court were, it didn’t detract from the story’s value.  \n\n- **Concept and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The concept of the story is fascinating and enjoyable. I found the whole idea to be engaging and well-developed.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing is quite slow, which was a bit of a drawback for me. However, I believe the slower pace serves a valid purpose, as the story focuses more on character development and internal battles.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The character development is excellent. All the characters, including the side characters, felt well-rounded and not like \"filler people.\"  \n   - There’s no real \"villain\" in the traditional sense—just the scary beast and the emotional damage the characters must overcome.  \n   - Both Beau and Belle were reasonable and likable characters, and I rooted for them from the start.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance felt a bit like insta-love, which was a minor issue for me. However, I acknowledge that the original Disney movie also has this element, so I can’t fault the author for following a similar approach.  \n\n- **Nostalgia and Context:**  \n   - Before reading, I was excited about the idea of a gender-swapped *Beauty and the Beast* retelling. It reminded me of the 2012-2015 era when retellings were popular, and I felt a sense of nostalgia.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly original and enjoyable retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* with strong character development and a fascinating concept.

Arabella warns him about his stitches, yet he never pulls them, and his pain inexplicably vanishes. Later, after injuring his leg again and falling into a freezing river—putting him on the brink of death—he suddenly recovers without any consequences.",
            "I really enjoyed both Beau and Arabella. Initially, I didn't know Arabella well, but by the end, she became my favorite character. The supporting cast of servants was fantastic—I loved them! Beau and Arabella were cute together for the most part, though their romance felt a bit rushed. Their unconventional first meeting was exciting and original, especially for a Beauty and the Beast retelling.",
            "Certain comments seemed out of place considering the story's context.",
            "The first half of the story was infused with subtle gothic elements that I appreciated. However, the 18th-century French setting lacked authenticity, particularly in the dialogue, which didn’t align with the time period. If the castle has been frozen in time for a century, the outside world should show more noticeable changes. For instance, Arabella references a noblewoman and her jewels, yet that noblewoman would have long since passed, and their fashion would be considered outdated.",
            "The retelling was impressively original and skillfully executed. I particularly enjoyed the creative twist on the curse. While there were several nods to the Disney adaptation, the story stood apart, avoiding a simple rehash of that version."

It examines whether societal expectations justify the accompanying pain and suffering or if one can authentically choose to embrace their true self.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n   - This is a fairytale retelling, specifically of *Beauty and the Beast*, which is my favorite fairytale.  \n   - Jennifer Donnelly is my favorite author for fairytale retellings, and this book felt like it was written for me.  \n   - The story raises questions about societal expectations placed on women to be good, quiet, and follow the rules, while also showing the price of being \"pretty and sparkly\" in traditional fairytales.  \n\n- **Originality and Creativity:**  \n   - The roles are flipped in this retelling: the Beauty is a man (Beau), and the Beast is a woman (Arabella). I loved this twist!  \n   - The magic in this version is clever and unique, though it took me a little while to fully understand some of its elements.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Beau and Arabella are complex characters with layers of mistakes, pain, and guilt.  \n   - Beau is forced into a life of seduction and robbery after being orphaned and is teased by other thieves for his good looks.  \n   - Arabella lives an isolated life with her court of ladies, who are slightly odd and scary.  \n   - The chemistry between Arabella and Beau is fantastic, with plenty of witty banter.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - The castle feels cold, creepy, and isolated, which adds to the vivid atmosphere.  \n   - The side characters, including the court ladies and servants, are important to the story and enhance its depth.  \n\n- **Message and Impact:**  \n   - The story left me thinking about its important messages long after finishing it.  \n   - It explores whether societal expectations are worth the pain and suffering or if one can choose to be true to oneself.  \n   - Love is a central theme, as Arabella must decide what truly matters to her.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good fairytale retelling that isn’t all sugar and sweetness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a brilliant and original retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, with a fresh twist on the classic roles. Jennifer Donnelly’s writing is captivating, and the story’s complex characters, vivid atmosphere, and thought-provoking themes make it a standout. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the tone is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a high rating.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nA big thank you to NetGalley and Scholastic Press for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."

The characters are vividly developed, and the story’s inventive twists and themes challenge traditional narratives, making it a standout work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Beauty and the Beast was one of my favorite movies growing up, and I was so excited to see a book spin-off of the original tale.  \n\n- **Characterization and Role Reversal:**  \n  I love that she was the “beast” in this story, but not because of doing something terribly bad. Instead, it was for going against societal norms of the time and wanting to be something more.  \n\n- **Humor and Entertainment Value:**  \n  I did not expect this book to be SO funny at times. It truly was entertaining and so interesting.  \n\n- **Depth and Themes Beyond Romance:**  \n  I like that the story wasn’t all smut and only romance. It had depth and meaning that went beyond the romance aspect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and refreshing take on the classic Beauty and the Beast story.

It also includes a few evil \"fairies\" that add to the story's depth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Arabella, the protagonist, has been fighting her true self for years, adding layers to her character. Beau, a thief with a heart buried under years of trauma, is equally compelling. Their dynamic and growth are central to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  The story is a reimagining of *Beauty and the Beast*, but with unique twists, such as Arabella being the cursed one and the inclusion of modern societal issues. The curse-breaking premise remains familiar but feels fresh and engaging.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book resonated deeply with me, addressing the negative thoughts and societal pressures many of us face, such as not feeling good enough, pretty enough, or smart enough. It also explores themes of self-love, hope, and faith.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is gorgeous, with a tone that balances the magical and the emotional. It kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a must-read! It’s not just a fairy tale but a profound exploration of societal issues, self-acceptance, and love. The characters are richly developed, the plot is both familiar and original, and the emotional depth is truly moving.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI LOVED LOVED LOVED this book! (5/5 stars)"

            "Arabella is a brilliantly crafted character, particularly in her beastly form. My favorite moment was when she humorously warned Beau away from her squirrel snack, which added a delightful charm to her persona. I also appreciated the author’s skillful personification of the powerful emotions Arabella had to suppress, making her journey both relatable and impactful.",

While it features dual perspectives and a happy ending, the emphasis on a growth mindset is what truly resonates. This retelling of a timeless story is refreshing and suitable for younger readers aged 12-13, as it avoids any questionable romantic elements."

The idea of defining \"beastly\" as a girl taking up too much space or wanting something of her own is both unique and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Arabella's character is brilliantly crafted, especially in her beastly form. My absolute favorite part was when she warns Beau away from her squirrel snack—it was hilarious and added a layer of charm to her character. I also really appreciated how Donnelly personified the big emotions Arabella was forced to suppress, making her journey feel deeply relatable and impactful.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  The ending is just *chef's kiss*—it ties everything together beautifully and leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While the publisher categorizes it as a romance, I see it more as a story about growth and self-discovery. The dual POV and the happily-ever-after (HEA) are present, but the focus on a growth mindset stands out more. It’s a great retelling of a timeless story, and I appreciate that it’s appropriate for younger readers (12-13 years old) without any inappropriate romantic elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a refreshing and clever retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, with a unique role reversal and a strong focus on emotional growth and self-discovery.

            "This book offers a fresh retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, set against the backdrop of 18th-century France during Voltaire's time. It follows a band of wayward thieves evading the law, reminiscent of *Tangled*. The midpoint twist is especially well-crafted and captivating. While the curse's premise stands out from other versions, a minor flaw exists that slightly detracts from the overall enjoyment.",

Their relationship unfolds beautifully as they learn to trust and heal one another, overcoming guilt and despair together. The gender-swapped dynamic introduces a refreshing and enjoyable twist to the classic tale.",
            "This gender-swapped retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* features a cursed character and a charming thief, incorporating magical mirrors, comic raw onion eating reminiscent of *Shrek*, and a thrilling wolf attack. A standout moment is the invitation to dinner, complete with elegant attire and dancing. The Beast’s ability to calm only for the protagonist creates a touching dynamic in their relationship. The writing is beautifully immersive, making for an enjoyable journey from start to finish. The unique chapter styles become increasingly appealing as the story unfolds. Overall, the tone deftly balances humor, romance, and emotional depth.",

While it touches on topics such as infidelity, accidental murder, and societal shaming of women, these elements are treated with sensitivity. The romance is low-spice, featuring a plot-relevant intimate scene, accidental groping, and kissing."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Historical Authenticity:**  \n  The novel is set in a specific historical time period, but the characters and their behavior feel anachronistic, as if they could be wearing jeans and sneakers. This lack of historical immersion made it difficult for me to connect with the setting.  \n\n- **Retelling and Originality:**  \n  While the story is a retelling of a classic tale (gender-swapped Beauty and the Beast), it doesn’t feel distinct or innovative enough. The changes, such as the gender swap, seem significant on paper but ultimately feel anticlimactic and fail to bring a fresh perspective to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  The novel features a large cast of characters, but they all come across as ordinary and unremarkable. Despite the size of the cast, I found myself unable to care about any of them, which made it hard to stay invested in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggled to hold my interest due to its lack of historical authenticity, underwhelming retelling of a classic story, and unengaging characters. I stopped reading at the 20% mark because I simply wasn’t feeling connected to the narrative or its world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 20%."

This abrupt resolution left the narrative unsatisfying and underdeveloped. While the concept of Arabella’s emotions as physical entities was intriguing, it was executed poorly. Beau’s disbelief and quick dismissal of this idea squandered a chance for deeper exploration. Additionally, the disjointed shifts between the perspectives of Beau, Arabella, and a servant disrupted the story's flow and made it difficult to connect with Arabella’s plight. Focusing too much on Beau's perspective missed an opportunity to more fully explore Arabella’s emotional journey.",
            "The romance between Beau and Arabella is hindered by Instalove, as they profess their love without having spent meaningful time together or truly knowing each other. This lack of development renders their relationship feel rushed and unrealistic.",
            "The story contains several unexplained elements, including how Arabella triggered the curse in a world devoid of magic, the reasoning behind Death's role as the clockmaker, and the villagers' lack of curiosity regarding the sudden return of Arabella and her people after the curse was lifted. These logical gaps and shortcomings in world-building detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "The book appears to target a Young Adult audience, given the age of the protagonists, Beau and Arabella, as well as the language employed. However, the writing style aligns more with Middle Grade literature, creating ambiguity about its intended audience."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book had a promising premise as a genderbent retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, it fell short in execution. Issues with pacing, character development, and world-building hindered the emotional impact of the story. The reliance on the original fairy tale’s familiarity left little room for the book to stand out on its own. Despite some creative ideas, the overall experience was underwhelming.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Target Audience and Writing Style:**\n   - The book seems to be marketed as Young Adult due to the age of the main characters (Beau and Arabella) and the language used, but the writing style leans more towards Middle Grade. This inconsistency made it difficult to determine the intended audience.\n\n- **Instalove and Character Development:**\n   - The romance between Beau and Arabella suffers from \"Instalove,\" where they declare love for each other without spending meaningful time together or knowing much about one another. This lack of development made their relationship feel rushed and unbelievable.\n\n- **Handling of the Curse and Genderbent Retelling:**\n   - The genderbent retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* had potential, but the execution fell short. The curse, which is tied to Arabella suppressing her emotions, wasn’t explored deeply enough. The summary suggested explosive emotions, but Arabella’s struggles felt underdeveloped and lacked emotional depth.\n   - The majority of the story is told from Beau’s perspective, which detracted from the introspective nature of the curse (learning to love oneself). This choice undermined the genderbent theme and made Arabella’s journey feel secondary.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**\n   - The final confrontation between Arabella and her emotions was rushed, occurring in the last ten minutes of the curse. This abrupt resolution felt unsatisfying and underdeveloped.\n   - The reveal of Arabella’s emotions as physical entities was intriguing but poorly executed. Beau’s disbelief and the quick dismissal of this concept wasted an opportunity for deeper exploration.\n\n- **World-Building and Unanswered Questions:**\n   - Several elements of the story were left unexplained, such as how Arabella caused the curse in a world with no other magic, why Death was the clockmaker, and why the villagers didn’t question the sudden reappearance of Arabella and her people after the curse was lifted. These gaps in logic and world-building detracted from the overall narrative.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Emotional Engagement:**\n   - The disjointed switches between Beau’s, Arabella’s, and a servant’s perspectives disrupted the flow of the story and made it harder to connect emotionally with Arabella’s plight. The focus on Beau’s perspective was a missed opportunity to delve deeper into Arabella’s emotional journey.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book had a promising premise as a genderbent retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, it fell short in execution. Issues with pacing, character development, and world-building hindered the emotional impact of the story. The reliance on the original fairy tale’s familiarity left little room for the book to stand out on its own.

However, the mystery surrounding the curse and the mysterious ladies became stretched out over time, diminishing its impact by the revelation. Initially, the plot centers on Beau's quest to reach his brother, causing the curse to feel secondary. The slow pacing, combined with the delayed unveiling of the mystery, ultimately led to a loss of interest.",

Additionally, the backstories of both characters are rushed, leaving readers wishing for more depth and context.",
            "The portrayal of Arabella's emotions as human characters, particularly with their names as anagrams, was a unique and intriguing concept. However, the explanations for how these emotions became personified and the nature of the curse were insufficient, leaving many questions unanswered.

            "The book's premise is unoriginal, following the familiar trope of a curse that can only be broken by true love. It closely resembles Lish McBride's *Curses* (2021), featuring a beastly young woman who defies convention and a misunderstood, attractive thief as her love interest. However, the twist that Arabella has cast her own curse due to struggles with emotions and self-denial offers a refreshing perspective. Importantly, the curse is ultimately lifted through self-love rather than romantic love, though this revelation comes late in the narrative. The pacing is uneven, as the central conflict and its resolution emerge too late; much of the story centers on Beau’s attempts to escape the castle and miscommunication with Arabella. Additionally, their instalove feels rushed and unconvincing, lacking sufficient meaningful interactions to support their feelings.",

These women are ultimately unveiled as personifications of Arabella's emotions, adding an intriguing layer to the narrative. However, despite these themes, the characters and their relationships remain underdeveloped, particularly the instantaneous love between Beau and Arabella, which comes off as shallow and unconvincing.",
            "The book presents a perplexing and abstract narrative reminiscent of an absurdist fever dream, similar to *Alice in Wonderland*. It features bizarre and unexplained elements, including a giant gold clock with human-like parts, undead monsters in the moat, and imprisoned children. While there are standout quotes that resonate with readers, the overall tone and structure of the story hinder full engagement.",

Arabella’s curse, where her emotions take the form of critics, is an intriguing concept that adds depth to her character. While the plot begins with strong momentum, it loses focus after the first third, becoming convoluted and less engaging. The origins and mechanics of the curse are insufficiently explained, leaving several unanswered questions, such as how Arabella's emotions became human and why they remained after the curse was lifted.",

Initially, Arabella seems unlikable, but as the story unfolds, her character reveals complexity, even if her true self remains somewhat elusive. However, the romance between Beau and Arabella feels rushed and lacks depth, bordering on insta-love.",

Key plot points, such as the revelation of the kitchen boy as Love, feel unearned due to insufficient buildup and foreshadowing.",
            "The story spends excessive time in Beau’s perspective, which diminishes Arabella’s struggles and growth. Her emotional journey and the curse representing her tumultuous feelings are underdeveloped due to the focus on Beau. While Beau's backstory—his life of theft and concern for his sick brother—is intriguing, it ultimately overshadows Arabella’s narrative. The supporting characters, such as Hope, Faith, and the kitchen boy, feel underutilized and forgettable. Arabella’s reconciliation with her parents comes off as unearned and overly sentimental, especially given their previous portrayal as unrepentant. Their sudden transformation from inanimate clockwork dolls to emotionally complex characters lacks depth and believability.",

While the exploration of societal expectations and mental health through Arabella’s character was profound, the story suffered from uneven pacing, underdeveloped subplots, and an overemphasis on Beau’s perspective. The rushed ending and unearned resolutions left much to be desired, but the book still offered some compelling ideas and moments of depth.",

While the exploration of societal expectations and mental health through Arabella’s character was profound, the story suffered from uneven pacing, underdeveloped subplots, and an overemphasis on Beau’s perspective.

Together, they embark on a journey to break the curse, find their own paths, and set things right. Their collaboration drives the narrative and adds depth to this enchanting fairytale.",
            "This story features remarkable character development. Beau undergoes a profound transformation, evolving from a selfish, blameful thief into a mature, loving man worthy of Arabella.

For a century, she lives with her emotions as she transforms into a beast at midnight each day, locking herself away and fleeing into the forest to protect her people, only to return at dawn. Initially, she believes she needs a suitor's love to break her curse, but ultimately learns the importance of self-love. The supporting characters are equally admirable, showcasing loyalty and love for their mistress despite her flaws. Additionally, Death is portrayed as a surprising yet intriguing character, enhancing the narrative.",

            "I enjoyed Arabella's rediscovery of her passion for architecture, which resonated with my own winter struggles with motivation. While the book recognized that the inhabitants couldn’t simply resume their former lives, I felt there could have been further exploration of the consequences of such a significant time jump.",
            "The author attempts to develop the relationship between Beau and Arabella, but I found it lacking, making their rapid romance hard to believe. However, Arabella's journey of self-acceptance, particularly in navigating her chronic depression and anxiety, was both relatable and rewarding to read. While I liked Beau, I struggled to understand why he kept his sick, possibly dying brother a secret. Revealing this earlier could have garnered him more support and made his actions more comprehensible.",
            "The book is both thoughtful and clever; however, the Wish for It feature on NetGalley came across as somewhat pretentious.",
            "The ending realistically portrayed Arabella's continued struggles with self-love. However, I wished for more insight into how the world responded to the castle's inhabitants disappearing and reappearing after a hundred years.",
            "The emphasis on self-love over romantic love truly elevates the story. While some metaphors are clever, others come off as slightly heavy-handed. The narrative treats the concept of engaging with one's emotions with earnestness. The physical beast aspect takes a backseat to the story's deeper themes, which may disappoint those who are primarily drawn to that element.",
            "I commend the author for making this \"Beauty and the Beast\" retelling uniquely her own. She skillfully crafts a more metaphorical and relatable story than the original, focusing on self-love rather than romantic love. While this theme isn't new to retellings, her narrative effectively justifies that emphasis."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a good, thoughtful, and clever retelling of Beauty and the Beast, with a strong focus on self-love and relatable themes. While the romantic relationship felt underdeveloped and some plot elements lacked depth, Arabella’s journey of self-acceptance and the book’s metaphorical richness made it an enjoyable read.",

            "This reimagining of *Beauty and the Beast* presents a fresh and unique perspective. The story centers on Beau, a thief abandoned in a mysterious castle by his band. Lady Arabella, the castle's inhabitant, is a complex character who has been suppressed her entire life, urged to be smaller and quieter despite her intelligence and passion for architecture.

The inventive twists on the curse are especially captivating, with cleverly placed clues that enhance the story's depth and intrigue.",

The interaction between the servants and courtiers further enriches the story, adding tension and complexity to the castle's atmosphere.",

The fight against societal constraints is a central theme that resonates throughout the narrative."

            "The reveal of the Beast’s curse and backstory came too late, slowing down the first half of the story. However, the second half picked up significantly, featuring engaging backstory reveals and thrilling action sequences that held my interest. I would have preferred a more consistent pacing throughout, with more high-action moments introduced earlier on.",
            "In this story, the main character is cursed not from a lack of love, but from her refusal to acknowledge her feelings, which ultimately torment her. Both protagonists support each other's growth and challenge the stereotypes imposed upon them. The male character’s early confession of love introduces an intriguing dynamic. While romance is present, it is founded on mutual growth and understanding rather than dependency. Although miscommunication arises frequently, the forced proximity of the characters allows them to address and resolve their issues effectively.",
            "This gender-swapped retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* intrigued me with its exploration of self-love, emotional acknowledgment, and the challenge of stereotypes. The unexpected yet impactful message of feeling your emotions and embracing self-love stood out. I appreciated the refreshing perspective that one doesn't need a man to find salvation. However, the story also delves into heavy themes such as child abuse, blood, body disfigurement, gaslighting, loss, and terminal illness.",
            "The personification of emotions added a unique and unexpected twist that required some adjustment. However, the book concludes on a satisfying happy note."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book had its moments and delivered a meaningful message about self-love and emotional growth. While the pacing was uneven and some reveals felt delayed, the second half was engaging and the unique elements, like the personified feelings, added depth. It’s not my favorite retelling, but it’s worth a read for its themes and character development.",

It started with the Disney animated movie in my childhood, and as a teen, I rediscovered my love for the story through Robin McKinley’s retelling, *Beauty*. Even now, I find elements of this tale woven into my favorite stories, which explains my obsession with *ACOTAR*. When I had the chance to read and review Jennifer Donnelly’s *Beastly Beauty*, I eagerly took it.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The book flips the script by featuring a cursed daughter of a duke, Arabella, who holds the fate of her court in her hands. Her last chance lies with Beau, a thief who doesn’t believe love is real. Through Arabella and Beau’s perspectives, Donnelly crafts a stunning tale of heartache and acceptance that captivates from start to finish.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - **Arabella’s Journey:** Arabella is a young woman who has spent her life suppressing her dreams and emotions to conform to societal expectations. Her emotional journey and the lessons she learns along the way are deeply compelling.  \n  - **Beau’s Role:** Beau is equally well-developed, with his own strengths and personal journey. Neither character overshadows the other, and their emotional arcs complement each other beautifully.  \n\n- **Nostalgic Elements:**  \n  I loved the little moments that reminded me of other versions of the *Beauty and the Beast* tale. These nods to the classic story added a layer of familiarity and charm.  \n\n- **Originality and Depth:**  \n  The truth about Arabella’s court was fascinating and added significant depth to the story. I enjoyed piecing it together alongside Beau, which made the narrative even more engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Tropes:**  \n  - **Found Family:** This is one of my favorite tropes, and it was wonderfully executed in the book.  \n  - **Lack of Spice:** As an adult reader, I sometimes enjoy a bit of spice, but I knew this wasn’t that kind of book going into it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Beastly Beauty* by Jennifer Donnelly is a perfect read for fairytale fans, especially those who, like me, have a strong obsession with *Beauty and the Beast*. It’s appropriate for younger readers but equally enjoyable for adults.

            "Beau, the male lead, is a thief driven by necessity and desperation, adding depth to his character. He possesses a charming yet insincere demeanor but reveals a genuine compassion when he trusts others. Arabella, the female lead, initially comes off as distant and aloof; however, as Beau learns more about her, her intricate layers unfold, making her transformation both compelling and integral to the story's intrigue.",
            "The story's moral becomes overly pronounced by the end, especially in its emphasis on Arabella’s beastly nature being linked to her attitude rather than her appearance. While the message—particularly for women—is valuable, it feels excessively reinforced through Beau’s dialogue, Arabella’s insights, and the author’s concluding chapter.",

            "*BEASTLY BEAUTY* presents a captivating premise with its gender-flipped retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*. The author effectively crafts Arabella, the female main character, as a \"beast\" by challenging the stereotypical expectations of women in her era. Her ambitions that extend beyond marriage and societal norms are a refreshing twist and a major strength of the story. However, the book's tone feels more juvenile, reminiscent of middle-grade fiction, making it better suited for older elementary and middle school readers.

            "In this story, Beauregard, a thief trapped in a castle, teams up with its resident, Arabella, to break a curse. While the premise is compelling, the execution lacks depth. The curse is explained rather than demonstrated, and the flashbacks to Arabella’s childhood miss the opportunity to more vividly convey her emotional struggles.",
            "The romance between Beau and Arabella is underdeveloped, as their limited interactions fail to create the expected emotional depth.",
            "The writing is clear and engaging, showcasing the author's storytelling ability. Despite some flaws in the novel, the writing style stands out as a key strength.",
            "The novel offers a gender-swapped retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, presenting a refreshing twist: the beast is not physically monstrous but is defined by a brutal personality. Unlike traditional adaptations, such as Disney's, this interpretation focuses the curse on negative emotions rather than appearance, providing a unique perspective on the classic tale.",
            "The novel struggles with its identity, oscillating between young adult and middle grade genres. While it attempts to position itself as young adult, the tone and content often skew toward middle grade, resulting in a noticeable inconsistency."

        "conclusion": "*Beastly Beauty* offers a unique and creative concept with its gender-swapped retelling and emotional curse, but the execution doesn’t fully live up to its potential. The novel struggles with genre identity, underdeveloped romance, and a lack of depth in illustrating the curse. However, the writing is engaging, and the story remains entertaining. While this particular novel didn’t fully meet my expectations, I appreciate the author’s creativity and would be open to reading more of her work in the future.",

It tries to present itself as young adult, but the tone and content lean more toward middle grade, creating a sense of inconsistency.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n   - The romance between Beau and Arabella feels underdeveloped.

Their love for each other during difficult times adds depth to the narrative. Arabella's character is brilliantly depicted, showcasing her essence and rage, along with the intriguing mythology of her and her ladies. Even with a multitude of side characters, each one is distinct and memorable.",

The exploration of forgiveness—especially Arabella's journey to forgive her parents and herself—was poignant and thoughtfully handled.

The curse can only be broken by someone who truly loves her for who she is. The arrival of Beau, a thief entangled in this curse, adds tension and complexity to the narrative.

            "The cast of servants adds wonderful depth to the story. Beau, the male lead, stands out as a sneaky, resourceful, and relatable character, a refreshing change from the increasingly idealized romantic heroes. As a thief with a hard life, Beau is self-serving and cynical, yet his flirtatious demeanor masks his deeper emotions, making him a compelling figure. Arabella, the beast, is the duke’s daughter, cursed for nearly a century. Her cold and aloof exterior conceals her true feelings, creating a poignant contrast to Beau's character. Their relationship is sweet and a standout element of the book; however, the pacing feels uneven. They have a brief encounter early on, but it isn’t until around 20% into the story that they interact again, and it takes even longer for them to spend significant time together. While their attraction develops quickly upon reconnecting, the slow start makes their later romance feel rushed.",
            "The curse presents numerous elements that can be overwhelming. Various components, such as the clock, the beast, the servants, court ladies, Lady Espidra, the children, and fairy tale interludes, occasionally detract from the main plot. The foundation of the curse feels fragile and overly simplistic, relying heavily on the stereotype of Arabella as “not like other girls” for her love of books, learning, and travel. The notion that Arabella's curse is self-created suggests an implausible reality where she is the first woman so oppressed that her circumstances distort reality, which stretches the boundaries of fairy tale logic.",
            "The characters' emotional arcs are deeply earned and ultimately satisfying.",
            "While *Beauty and the Beast* has seen numerous retellings, this version introduces intriguing new concepts that refresh the classic story. The surprising twist of Arabella literally transforming into the beast at night adds a unique layer to the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and Freshness of the Retelling:**  \n   - While *Beauty and the Beast* has been retold many times, this version introduces new and interesting concepts to keep the story fresh.  \n   - The twist about Arabella literally turning into the beast at night was surprising and added a unique layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characterization and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - Beau, the male lead, is a thief with a hard life, making him resourceful, self-serving, and cynical. His flirtatious and jokey persona hides his suppressed emotions, making him a compelling character.  \n   - Arabella, the beast, is the daughter of a duke trapped by a curse for nearly a hundred years. Her cold and aloof demeanor masks her true emotions, creating a poignant contrast to Beau’s personality.  \n   - The emotional arcs of the characters are well-earned and satisfying.  \n\n- **Relationship Development and Pacing:**  \n   - The relationship between Beau and Arabella is sweet and a highlight of the book.  \n   - However, the pacing of their relationship feels uneven. They meet briefly early on, but it takes until around 20% of the book for them to interact again, and even longer for them to spend significant time together.  \n   - Their attraction develops quickly once they do connect, but the slow start makes the relationship feel rushed later on.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot Complexity:**  \n   - The curse has many moving parts, which can feel overwhelming. Elements like the clock, the beast, the servants, the court ladies, Lady Espidra, the children, and the fairy tale interludes sometimes distract from the main plot.  \n   - The basis for the curse feels weak and overly simplistic, relying on the trope of Arabella being “not like other girls” because she reads books and wants to learn and travel.  \n   - Arabella’s curse being self-created implies a strange reality where she is the first woman ever to be so oppressed by her circumstances that it warps reality, which feels unrealistic even within fairy tale logic.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The cast of servants is wonderful and adds depth to the story.  \n   - Beau’s character as a sneaky, resourceful, and down-to-earth male lead is refreshing compared to the rise of overly idealized romantic fantasy heroes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Beastly Beauty* is an enjoyable retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* with fresh twists and compelling characters. While the pacing of the central relationship and the complexity of the curse’s mechanics could have been better handled, the emotional arcs and unique elements make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The curse and its origins were quite confusing, and the inclusion of a beastly element felt unnecessary, as if it were added solely to meet genre expectations. While the curse itself was intriguing, this addition detracted from the overall coherence of the story.",
            "The characters, especially Arabella and Beau, were compellingly flawed, which added depth to the story. The secondary characters also had rich backstories that enhanced the narrative. Unlike many Beauty and the Beast retellings, those living in the palace with the Beast were equally cursed, each with their own motivations and personalities. However, I found the romance unconvincing; it felt rushed, with a sudden shift from dislike to professed love that lacked adequate development.",
            "The story lacks extensive world-building, which ultimately works to its advantage, as the focus remains squarely on the characters. At its core, the narrative revolves around these individuals, with the plot driven by their actions and interactions.",
            "The conclusion lacked the emotional impact it could have achieved.",
            "*Beauty and the Beast* was one of the stories that sparked my love for fairy tales, and while I don't enjoy every retelling, *Beastly Beauty* was a delightful experience. Its straightforward narrative kept me engaged, offering a quick, exhilarating ride that was both enjoyable and refreshing. After tackling some overly intricate stories, this was the perfect recharge I needed.",
            "While this story leans towards the younger side of young adult fiction, I found that aspect quite enjoyable. It reminds us that not all narratives need to present a harsh reality, which is a big part of why I appreciated it so much."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I really enjoyed *Beastly Beauty*. It’s a quick, fun retelling with engaging characters and a refreshing simplicity. While the romance felt rushed and the curse’s execution was confusing, the story’s charm and character-driven focus made it an enjoyable read.",

One moment, they didn’t like each other, and the next, they professed their love, which felt undeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The conclusion didn’t have nearly the emotional impact it could have.  \n   - The curse and how it happened were extremely confusing, with an added aspect that made no sense other than to include the \"beastly\" element expected in these stories.  \n   - The curse itself was interesting, but the addition felt unnecessary and thrown in just because it was expected.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed *Beastly Beauty*. It’s a quick, fun retelling with engaging characters and a refreshing simplicity. While the romance felt rushed and the curse’s execution was confusing, the story’s charm and character-driven focus made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the theme is enjoyable, it feels somewhat obvious and a bit \"on the nose,\" albeit not overly forced. I'm not a fan of drama stemming from characters' secrets, which the book employs to maintain suspense until the reveal.

Additionally, the presentation of the scene left me slightly confused, though it didn't detract significantly from the overall story.",

            "As the story unfolds, Beau's character becomes increasingly unlikable. His bitter, mean-spirited nature undermines any attempts to portray him as charming, especially given his frequent failures at flirting. Meanwhile, Arabella, the beast, lacks depth and intrigue. Although her human form is visually appealing and somewhat standoffish, her motivations—such as rebelling against her mother due to an interest in architecture—feel shallow and underdeveloped. Her beastly form is equally uninspiring, described generically with terms like claws, teeth, and fur. The abundance of minor characters makes it challenging to keep track of their roles or to invest in them emotionally. Additionally, the character Espidra comes off as hokey, and the revelation that her name is an anagram for \"Despair\" feels overly contrived and cheesy."

            "Beau, the main character, is incredibly likable—with his upbeat personality, humor, suave demeanor, and street smarts, I grew fonder of him as the story progressed. He reminded me of Flynn Rider from *Tangled* in all the best ways, and his deep love for his younger brother made his character even more engaging. In contrast, I found it difficult to warm up to Arabella until later in the story. Her ladies-in-waiting were unsettling, with overly clever names that distracted from the narrative, and their controlling behavior made them uncomfortable to read about. However, once Arabella found her voice, she became charming and intriguingly mysterious. My main critique is the rapid pace at which the characters fell in love—this transition from mere tolerance to deep affection felt rushed and unconvincing.",

As a fan of Jennifer Donnelly’s *Waterfire Saga*, I had high expectations, and the book did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Main Characters:**  \n  - Beau, the main character, is incredibly likable. His upbeat nature, humor, suave demeanor, and street smarts made me grow fonder of him as the story progressed. He reminded me of Flynn Rider from *Tangled* in the best ways, and his deep love for his younger brother made me completely invested in his character.  \n  - Arabella, on the other hand, was difficult to like until much later in the story. Her ladies-in-waiting were creepy and had bizarre names, which felt overly clever and distracting. They were controlling and made my skin crawl whenever they appeared. However, once Arabella was able to be herself, I found her charming and intriguingly mysterious.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  - My main complaint is how quickly the characters fell in love. The build-up felt glossed over, making their transition from tolerating each other to being head over heels feel rushed and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite the rushed romance, this book is a wonderful retelling of the classic tale with a fresh gender-swapped twist. I highly recommend it to teens and young adults who enjoy twisted fairy tales.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“Beastly Beauty” is a delightful and creative retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* with a gender-swapped twist.

While the pacing felt too fast, the novel’s depth and originality make it a worthwhile read, even with the long wait between Jennifer Donnelly’s releases.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As Beau seeks Arabella's assistance to rebuild a bridge for his escape, he uncovers the castle’s secrets and develops feelings for her. However, the curse-breaking aspect feels unsatisfying; the characters' declaration of love doesn’t instantaneously lift the curse, as Arabella must first learn to love herself.",

Arabella, portrayed as sad and somewhat pathetic, failed to embody the strength one expects from a heroine. The court of women surrounding her, each with peculiar names and emotional quirks, became exhausting to follow and detracted from the story. The romance between Beau and Arabella felt rushed, resulting in a love declaration that lacked fulfillment. Overall, their relationship lacked depth, and the emotional payoff suffered due to the rapid progression."

Arabella and Beau were compelling, and their roles in this reverse-gendered retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* added a fresh perspective to the classic tale.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  I did not enjoy the pacing of the book. For almost the first half, it felt like very little was happening, and then everything seemed to happen all at once. The relationship between Beau and Arabella went from never seeing or talking to each other to instalove, which felt rushed. I believe their relationship would have been more enjoyable if it had been developed at a steadier pace.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the book's empowering theme and well-crafted characters, the uneven pacing and rushed relationship development detracted from my overall enjoyment. The concept of personifying emotions was intriguing, but the execution of the plot left something to be desired.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.25 (rounded up)  \n\n*I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Scholastic in exchange for an honest review.*"

It didn’t just switch between Arabella and Beau, but from the ladies in waiting, servants, etc. While there were breaks in-between, it was still a guessing game on whose point of view or thoughts we would be reading. I love dual or multiple POVs, but this was a bit annoying for me to read this way.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**\n   - The supporting characters were great. Some of them had more depth and personality than would be expected, but they never overshadowed the main characters... well, except Chamille.

Her curse arose from defying societal norms, advocating for the less fortunate, and chasing her passion for architecture.

Both characters have tragic backstories shaped by their circumstances, though they are also held captive by their own emotions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Expectations:**  \n  - I initially didn’t want to like this book because I had read *Stepsister* by the same author and loved it. I requested *Beastly Beauty* hoping for a similar style, but it was different, which made the first third of the book a struggle for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Some characters felt shallow at first, which added to my initial difficulty in connecting with the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  - Despite my early struggles, I’m incredibly glad I continued reading. The book deeply resonated with me, addressing themes of childhood trauma and emotional health in a way that felt both raw and carefully handled.  \n  - For a moment, I felt seen and whole while reading, which I believe is the hallmark of a perfect book for someone. It’s not about the book being perfect, but about it being the perfect read for a specific moment in your life.  \n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  - The story soothed parts of me I didn’t realize needed healing, making it a profoundly impactful read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Beastly Beauty* initially struggled to meet my expectations due to its different style and shallow character portrayals, it ultimately became a deeply moving and transformative read. Its exploration of trauma and emotional health resonated with me on a personal level, making it a perfect book for this moment in my life.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It centers on 19-year-old Beau, who rides with a band of thieves that once saved his life. Although he is expected to contribute through stealing, his true ambition is to escape and rescue his younger brother, Matti, from an orphanage. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Arabella, the Duke’s daughter, resides in a cursed castle haunted by a menacing beast that appears at midnight. When Beau and his group reach the castle, they find it eerily empty except for a lavish feast laid out on the dining table. After indulging, they are forced to flee as the beast arrives, leaving Beau behind. The revelations Beau encounters while trapped in the castle ultimately change his life forever.",

I found myself caught up in the narrative, even if it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n  I was surprised to realize that roses didn’t play a role in this Beauty and the Beast-inspired tale. While I initially felt robbed of that classic element, I also questioned whether it was truly necessary since I didn’t notice its absence while reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel had its moments of sweetness, creativity, and engagement, but it fell short in terms of depth across world-building, characters, and romance. The plot, while somewhat derivative, kept me invested enough to finish the book. It’s a middle-of-the-road read for me—not bad, but not outstanding either.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

By page 77, the story had not progressed significantly, and the lack of momentum made it hard to continue reading.\n- **Character Development (Arabella):** Despite the book blurb focusing on Arabella, she had very little \"on-screen\" time in the first 77 pages. This limited exposure prevented her from being developed as a three-dimensional character, leaving her role in the story unclear.\n- **Character Development (Beau):** The primary focus in the early pages was on Beau, the thief, who gets caught while attempting one last job to save his sickly brother. His efforts to manipulate his way out of the castle after being trapped (due to the bridge being knocked down) were the main narrative thread, but this focus felt unbalanced given the blurb's emphasis on Arabella.\n- **World-Building and Plot Clarity:** By page 77, the curse mentioned in the blurb had not been explained or explored within the story itself. Readers only knew of its existence from the blurb, and Beau remained unaware of it. Additionally, Arabella appeared human, leaving the nature of the curse a mystery. This lack of clarity and world-building made it hard to feel invested in the plot.\n- **Engagement and Hooks:** Despite skimming ahead, there was no compelling hook or moment that encouraged further reading.

Their roles as embodiments of Arabella’s emotions, with names derived from scrambled letters, were a brilliant touch. Notably, Despair stood out, and her dynamic with Hope was particularly compelling.",
            "While the story's concept and certain elements were strong, the execution did not meet expectations. The romance and main characters failed to resonate, and the writing quality felt inconsistent. Although the philosophical themes were intriguing, they didn't fully integrate into the narrative, resulting in an uneven reading experience.",
            "The novel embarks on philosophical explorations, particularly through the conversations of the Ladies of the Court. The treatment of emotions like Despair and Hope is both thought-provoking and well-executed. However, this depth often feels incongruous within the framework of what otherwise appears to be a C-tier fantasy. As a gender-bent retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*, the story has its charms, but the romance is lackluster, and the main characters can be irritating. Nevertheless, the concept of the Ladies of the Court as representations of Arabella's tumultuous emotions is intriguing. The portrayal of Despair's dominance and the exploration of her complicated relationship with Hope add a level of depth and interest to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "This gender-bent *Beauty and the Beast* retelling had a lot of potential, particularly with its creative concept of the Ladies of the Court representing Arabella’s emotions. However, the weak romance, annoying main characters, and uneven execution held it back from being a standout read. The philosophical depth was a highlight, but it didn’t fully save the book from feeling like a C-tier fantasy.",

While the romance was underwhelming and the main characters were a bit annoying, the unique concept of the Ladies of the Court being representations of Arabella’s scrambled emotions was fascinating. The idea of Despair taking over and the exploration of her complicated relationship with Hope added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The main characters fell flat for me, as they came across as annoying and their romance lacked chemistry. However, the Ladies of the Court were the standout element. Their portrayal as embodiments of Arabella’s emotions, with their names being scrambled letters, was a brilliant touch. Despair, in particular, stood out, and her dynamic with Hope was compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Depth:**  \n  The novel attempts to delve into philosophical discussions, particularly through the interactions of the Ladies of the Court. The exploration of emotions like Despair and Hope was thought-provoking and well-executed. However, this depth felt somewhat out of place in what otherwise felt like a C-tier fantasy novel.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  While the concept and some elements of the story were strong, the execution fell short.

For example, the use of modern slang like \"swag\" doesn't fit the story's setting.  \n- **Integration of Fairy Tale References:**  \n  The passages referencing fairy tales felt random and only occasionally made sense within the context of the story.  \n- **Romance Development:**  \n  While some parts of the romance were well-executed, other moments made the main characters seem childish, detracting from the overall depth of their relationship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAs a fan of \"Beauty and the Beast\" retellings, I found this novel to be a mixed experience.

For instance, the people in the castle weren’t transformed into furniture, which added an intriguing twist. The surprises throughout the story were genuinely unexpected and enhanced the overall experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The chapters felt disjointed because they changed in random places on the pages and weren’t clearly set apart like in most books. This formatting choice was a bit distracting and detracted from the reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was an enjoyable and creative reimagining of a classic story, with plenty of surprises to keep me engaged. However, the unconventional chapter formatting was a notable drawback.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I prefer the original plot of learning to love others.  \n- **Reading Experience:** Overall, this book was fun to read, although a bit of a rollercoaster. It wasn’t what I expected though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book was an interesting and enjoyable read, with a unique take on emotions and a charming romance. However, the shift in the curse’s resolution to self-love felt less satisfying compared to the original idea of learning to love others. While it was a fun and unexpected journey, it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Surprisingly, this unique blend works well.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective:**  \n  I found myself wishing Arabella had been the sole or main narrator. The story, which revolves around learning to love oneself, feels less impactful when told from an outside point of view.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel successfully merges two distinct stories into a gothic YA retelling, the choice of narrative perspective slightly diminishes the emotional resonance of its central theme.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Introduction and Context:**  \n   - I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  \n   - I had previously read Jennifer Donnelly’s *Poisoned* and greatly enjoyed it, which set high expectations for *Beastly Beauty*.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story begins with Beau, a gender-bent Beauty, who is part of a group of thieves. They stumble upon an abandoned castle filled with food, but their plans to rob it are interrupted by a beast.  \n   - Beau becomes stranded at the castle with the beast after the bridge is destroyed by his fleeing companions.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - **Beau:** I found him funny at times, though he could also be daft and quick to anger. While he occasionally irritated me, I still liked his character overall.  \n   - **Arabella:** She took longer to grow on me because the beginning focused more on Beau. However, I came to appreciate her spirit and felt sympathy for her struggles, especially when she was discouraged from pursuing her passions. Her backstory was compelling, and I ended up really liking her.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - I didn’t have high expectations for the romance but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Beau and Arabella’s relationship. It was a significant improvement compared to the romance in *Poisoned*.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n   - The book is beautifully written, and the author conveyed a meaningful message through the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Beastly Beauty* is another wonderful book by Jennifer Donnelly. It met my high expectations, with engaging characters, a well-crafted romance, and a meaningful message. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

When I saw this adaptation, I was very excited to pick it up. The story is a twisted retelling where Arabella is the beast and Beau is the weary traveler trapped in the castle. The roles are swapped, and the curse is unique, with Arabella and her court trapped for a hundred years.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Beau is a thief, a poor kid trying to make a life for himself and support his younger brother. He’s resourceful but one-track minded. Arabella is plagued with despair and longing, knowing her time is almost up. While both protagonists are somewhat one-dimensional, the supporting characters are whimsical and lovely, keeping the story moving.  \n\n- **World-Building and Plot:**  \n  The overall story-building was well done. The castle, the curse, and the magical elements are intriguing. The story is told from Beau’s POV, with a whimsical storyteller’s voice inserted in a few places. The plot follows Beau’s attempts to escape while learning about the curse and Arabella’s desperation to break it. The ending was satisfying, with a strong overall message.  \n\n- **Originality and Adaptation:**  \n  This is not a straightforward gender-swapped retelling. Donnelly makes the story her own, diving into a new curse and adding fresh twists. If you’re looking for something true to the original tale, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy creative adaptations, this one is worth reading.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis *Beauty and the Beast* retelling offers a fresh and imaginative twist on the classic tale.

It was beautifully crafted and wholly unique. I thoroughly enjoyed, i.e., loved, every Jennifer Donnelly fairytale retelling I’ve read, and this was no exception. The emotional weight of the story was profound—I FELT for Beau and Arabella, rooted for them to get what they wanted and realize their worth. The reason behind the curse was heartbreaking, and the solution was surprising.  \n\n- **Characters and Their Dynamics:**  \n  The hero and heroine, Beau and Arabella, come from thoroughly different backgrounds and have distinct personalities and motivations. Their dynamic was compelling and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Originality:**  \n  This is a gender-bent Beauty and the Beast retelling with a curse that presents itself in a devastating and original way. The story begins and is mainly told from Beau’s perspective, which initially took some adjustment since the synopsis focuses on Arabella as the “beast.” However, once I adjusted, I was fully immersed.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Logic:**  \n  A couple of small logic/worldbuilding details snagged my attention while reading, but they were never major enough to distract from the story or detract from its emotional impact.  \n\n- **Easter Eggs and Fan Appeal:**  \n  The book is filled with Easter eggs for fans of the Disney movie and the original story, which added an extra layer of enjoyment for me.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Target Audience:**  \n  I couldn’t recommend this more, especially for those who, like me, have read countless fairytale retellings and are craving something fresh and new. *Beastly Beauty* delivers that and more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a beautifully crafted, emotionally resonant retelling of *Beauty and the Beast* with a unique twist.

            "This book offers a captivating gender-bender retelling of *Beauty and the Beast*. Instead of the familiar charming beauty and gruff beast, we are introduced to two unlikable characters: a thief playing the Beauty role and a prickly princess embodying the Beast. As a fan of the author’s Disney retellings, I found this one equally enjoyable. While the pacing leans toward the slow side, the enchanting castle world compensates for it. The narrative strikes a balance between character and plot development, showcasing substantial character growth.",
