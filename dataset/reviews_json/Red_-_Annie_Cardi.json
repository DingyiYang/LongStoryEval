Even when she initially thinks what happened is fine, her unease and quietness are evident.  \n\n- **Originality and Adaptation:**  \n  - While the book is a modern retelling of *The Scarlet Letter*, it doesn't feel like a copy. Tess is her own character, and the story isn't a beat-for-beat replication.  \n  - The absence of a shoe-horned romance is appreciated, as it avoids clichés.  \n\n- **Ending and Closure:**  \n  - The ending, particularly the support group scene, felt a bit rushed and hastily executed.  \n  - There’s a sense that Tess might have been given more closure, though the realistic ending where Alden skips town without consequences is acknowledged as reflective of real-life situations.  \n\n- **Social Relevance and Impact:**  \n  - The book is a necessary representation of issues that happen far more often than people would like to believe.  \n  - While I’m glad the book exists, it’s disheartening that it reflects today’s society so accurately.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a powerful and realistic portrayal of difficult themes, with well-developed characters and a respectful approach to its YA audience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  The novel tackles two significant and controversial topics—sexual abuse and reproductive rights—that are currently misaligned with the evangelical Christian church's stance. It weaves these themes into a story of courage, heartbreak, and forgiveness, making it both timely and impactful.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Accessibility:**  \n  This is a YA novel that deserves a place on youth library shelves. However, I anticipate it will face bans, particularly from Republican groups, due to its bold exploration of sensitive issues.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Realism:**  \n  The story felt deeply relatable, as I could vividly imagine this scenario playing out in my own upbringing. The reactions depicted in the book mirrored what I would expect in real life, adding to its authenticity.  \n\n- **Author's Craft and Narrative Depth:**  \n  The author's note at the end, which connects the narrative to *The Scarlet Letter*, provides a poignant reflection on how certain societal issues remain unchanged over time. Despite this, the book manages to infuse a sense of hope, showcasing the author's skill in balancing realism with optimism.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**  \n  The novel is very well done, and I would happily read more works by this author. It’s a powerful and thought-provoking read that resonates deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA novel is a courageous exploration of sensitive and relevant topics, blending heartbreak and hope with remarkable skill. It’s a must-read for its target audience, though its boldness may invite controversy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
