            "The supporting characters add complexity to the story, though they lack the depth of the main trio. Subplots involving past secrets and crimes enhance the intrigue but occasionally overshadow the primary narrative. The ending reveals the duplicitous nature of the mothers' actions, tying together various plot points. However, the resolution feels somewhat unsatisfying, as it simplifies the conflict by casting one character as the outright villain to justify the mothers' behavior. The novel centers on the fierce competition among three mothers vying for their sons' admission to the prestigious St. Ignatius Grammar School. It begins with a prologue that hints at the perilous School Run, which plays a crucial role in the story. As the plot shifts from school enrollment to uncovering past transgressions, it somewhat dilutes the original premise.",
            "The three main characters—Kaya, Estella, and Bec—are well-developed, each with unique personalities and motivations. Their relentless and often unscrupulous tactics to outmaneuver one another are both captivating and repulsive. The author offers sufficient backstory to clarify their actions, even as their behavior grows increasingly outrageous and morally ambiguous.",
            "This story masterfully blends dark comedy and thriller elements, creating a morbidly fascinating atmosphere as the mothers' increasingly extreme actions unfold. The tension and competition surrounding the school enrollment process heighten the stakes, while the writing remains strong, skillfully alternating between characters and their perspectives. Brief flashbacks are effectively integrated, enriching the characters and their motivations. Although the pacing is generally well-executed, the shift from the school enrollment focus to past grievances disrupts the narrative flow at times.",

It also delves into the darker facets of human nature, such as deception, manipulation, and the burden of hidden secrets. Additionally, the narrative examines how past sins can resurface, influencing present actions."

However, it loses some momentum as it shifts focus to past transgressions and personal motives. The character development is robust, and the writing is solid, but the narrative's shift and the somewhat contrived resolution detract from the overall impact.

            "The story follows three mothers—Kaya, Bec, and Estella—who are determined to secure their sons' enrollment at an elite boys' sports high school, culminating in the pivotal Gala Day. The narrative effectively builds tension, revealing unexpected connections between the families and the school as it unfolds. A dramatic turn occurs when a boy is struck down, triggering a series of secrets and revelations. While the first part of the book is immersive and detailed, the final third feels rushed and disjointed, with abrupt revelations and underdeveloped emotional responses. The beginning flows smoothly, featuring rich events and conversations, but the pacing becomes uneven later on, leading to a jumpy and scattered feel. Some outcomes seem forced or insufficiently explored.",

Estelle had only just discovered Sam, yet Kaya spoke to her and Bec as if she had always been aware of him.

Similarly, the other characters were difficult to embrace for different reasons.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story revolves around Kaya, who is trying to get her son into a prestigious Catholic boys' school to honor her late husband's wishes.  \n   - The school's admission process involves a weekend-long \"male beauty pageant\" to determine which children get in, leading the mothers to go to extreme lengths to secure spots for their sons.  \n   - The focus shifts heavily to the mothers and their dynamics, often overshadowing the original premise of getting the sons into school.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The three main characters (Kaya, Estella, and Bec) are portrayed as deeply flawed women, each with their own selfish tendencies and questionable parenting decisions.  \n   - Kaya, in particular, makes selfish choices after her husband's death, which stirred strong emotions in me.  \n   - The sons are depicted as quiet and obedient, while the daughters (like Estella's 17-year-old) add another layer to the mother-daughter dynamics.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The book is filled with puns, which I absolutely loved, especially those delivered by the male characters (referred to as \"ken's\").  \n   - The chapters become short and choppy as the story progresses, with frequent alternating points of view. While this technique can work well, here it felt manic and gave me whiplash.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n   - The story has a strong female focus, centering on the mothers and their relationships with their children, particularly their daughters.  \n   - The parenting decisions and the mothers' behavior often made me feel like a judgmental \"bitchy school mum,\" which added an interesting layer to my reading experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing becomes frantic as the story unfolds, with so much happening in quick succession.  \n   - The short, choppy chapters and frequent POV shifts disrupted the flow and made the narrative feel overwhelming at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a mix of humor, flawed characters, and chaotic storytelling. While I enjoyed the puns and the strong female focus, the manic pacing and choppy structure detracted from my overall experience. The flawed mothers and their questionable decisions made for a thought-provoking read, though it also stirred up strong personal reactions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the shift in focus and lack of sustained suspense slightly detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 4/5  \n- Characters: 4.5/5  \n- Pacing: 3.5/5  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 4/5"
