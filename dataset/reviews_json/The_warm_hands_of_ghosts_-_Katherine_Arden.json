            "The story's slow pacing detracts from overall engagement. While the ending offers a sense of hope, it feels overly tidy, with Laura's challenges often resolved with minimal effort. Centered on Laura Iven, a wounded field nurse, and her brother Freddie, who is presumed dead but survives in a perilous war-torn setting, the narrative explores dual timelines (1918 and 1917) and themes of World War I, PTSD, healing, and hope. However, the execution lacks depth, making the plot feel overly convenient.",
            "Laura is efficient, assertive, and determined, yet I struggled to empathize with her. In contrast, Freddie's vulnerability and intense emotions make him more relatable. While Hans Winter, the German soldier, is adequately written, he fails to leave a lasting impression as a hero.",

However, the paranormal elements, linked to Christian theories such as the Book of Revelation, come across as confusing and underdeveloped. Additionally, the forced romantic subplot detracts from the narrative, and the lack of exploration of certain period-specific aspects feels unrealistic."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Laura Iven, a wounded field nurse, and her brother Freddie, who is presumed dead but survives in a dangerous war-torn environment. The dual timelines (1918 and 1917) and the themes of World War I, PTSD, healing, and hope are intriguing. However, the execution falls short, with the plot feeling overly convenient and lacking depth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Laura is portrayed as efficient, assertive, and determined, but I found it hard to empathize with her. Freddie, on the other hand, is more relatable due to his vulnerability and intense emotions. Hans Winter, the German soldier, is decently written but doesn’t stand out as a hero.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The bleak and desolate portrayal of war is well-done and impactful. However, the paranormal elements, tied to Christian theories like the Book of Revelation, felt confusing and underdeveloped. The forced romantic subplot detracted from the story, and the lack of exploration of certain period-specific aspects felt unrealistic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is slow, which doesn’t help the overall engagement. The ending, while hopeful, feels too neatly resolved, with Laura’s challenges often being solved with minimal effort on her part.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Research:**  \n  The author’s note reveals a personal connection to the topic, but the final result feels average rather than exceptional. The inclusion of biblical quotes as chapter titles adds a layer of depth, but it may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Warm Hands of Ghosts* has its moments, particularly in its portrayal of war and Freddie’s emotional journey. However, the underdeveloped paranormal elements, forced romance, and convenient resolutions make it a disappointing read overall. While the premise is promising, the execution lacks the depth and impact needed to fully engage the reader.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.7 stars"

            "The story weaves together two narratives: Laura, a discharged nurse on the hunt for her brother, and her brother, who finds himself stranded in No Man's Land alongside a German soldier. At times, the plot feels stagnant, with the only real sense of progression coming from the interactions involving the enigmatic fiddler. This character stands out as the most captivating element of the story, reminiscent of the mastermind in *Labyrinth*.",
            "The book suffers from a lack of character development and depth. The protagonist, Laura, fails to engage the reader, making it difficult for her to carry the story. I found her brother's chapters more compelling, particularly due to his interactions with the fiddler. Additionally, the secondary characters, such as the grieving mother and the doctor who develops feelings for Laura, did not resonate with me.",

While some readers might rate it higher, I found it less compelling compared to the author’s previous trilogy. It’s best suited for readers seeking a mood-driven story rather than one centered on character growth.",

It has stayed in my thoughts since I finished it, and it’s now in my top 5 books of the year. I’m disappointed it wasn’t a BOTM pick, but I highly recommend it to everyone. If you loved *Addie LaRue*, you should definitely pick this up.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is incredible and kept me hooked from start to finish. I couldn’t put the book down because I was desperate to see how everything tied together. Arden is a master storyteller who clearly does extensive historical research. The story combines romance, magic, and mystery, offering something for everyone.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Arden’s writing is poignant, lyrical, and captivating. She has a unique ability to make you feel deeply immersed in the story, evoking emotions like cold, tiredness, loneliness, depression, and hopelessness. There were moments when I forgot I wasn’t physically in the story. Her writing is so powerful that I’m already craving more books from her.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved all the characters in this book. They speak and act authentically for the 1910s setting, with humor that sometimes went over my head. Each character has a distinct personality and voice, and Arden excels at making them feel real and fully fleshed out. Winter and Freddie, in particular, are absolute perfection and the best part of the story.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I urge everyone to preorder or pick up this book when it comes out. You won’t regret it. I was fortunate to receive an ARC via Netgalley, and it was a dream come true.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece that combines a gripping plot, immersive writing, and unforgettable characters.

            "The romantic subplot introduced in the latter part of the book feels forced and unnecessary. A deeper exploration of the relationship or a platonic friendship would have been more realistic and respectful of the characters' dynamics. The slow pacing detracts from overall engagement, and while the alternating timelines add complexity, they don't always enhance the narrative. The ending, though hopeful, resolves too neatly, with Laura's challenges often addressed with minimal effort on her part. Although the author's note reveals a personal connection to the topic, the final result feels average rather than exceptional. The story centers on Laura Iven, a wounded field nurse, and her brother Freddie, who is presumed dead but survives in a war-torn environment. The dual timelines (1918 and 1917) and themes of World War I, PTSD, healing, and hope are intriguing, but the execution lacks depth, making the plot feel overly convenient. While the book has its moments, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and impactful experience.",
            "Laura is efficient, assertive, and determined, yet I find it difficult to empathize with her. In contrast, Freddie's vulnerability and intense emotions make him more relatable. Hans Winter, the German soldier, is adequately portrayed but lacks the depth to be a compelling character.",

            "This historical fiction novel is set during the Great War in the 1910s, delving into the depths of tragedy and conflict. It follows Laura, who returns to Halifax after being discharged due to a leg injury, while her brother Freddie continues to fight in the trenches of Belgium. Determined to uncover the truth behind her brother's reported death, Laura volunteers at a private hospital in Belgium. The narrative alternates between Laura's perspective in 1918 and Freddie's experiences in 1917, creating a dual storyline that immerses readers in the contrasting realities of war.",

Freddie's chapters are particularly emotionally compelling, making him the standout character of the book. In contrast, Laura's perspective, while solid, lacks the same resonance. Additionally, the novel features a minor romantic subplot that I wished had been more developed.",
            "The author's writing is both evocative and immersive, yet the tone of *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* diverges significantly from her Winternight trilogy.

            "The book features two intertwining narratives: Laura, a nurse on a quest to find her brother, and her brother, who is trapped in No Man's Land alongside a German soldier. The plot gains momentum during the interactions with the enigmatic fiddler, a character that adds depth to the story. However, there were moments when reading felt laborious, as if a barrier existed between me and the characters.",
            "If you're seeking character development or depth, this book may not meet your expectations. The protagonist, Laura, lacks the compelling qualities that would make her journey engaging. I found her brother's chapters more intriguing, particularly his interactions with the fiddler. Other characters, such as the grieving mother and the doctor who falls for Laura, failed to resonate with me as well.",

Arden’s ability to weave pure magic into her words creates a dangerously addictive air of intrigue and desperation that keeps the reader entranced from start to finish.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Laura and Freddie are tragically compelling characters. While Laura is the main protagonist, Freddie’s perspective was more engaging due to the intoxicating sense of urgency and mystifying intrigue in his storyline. His dynamic with Winter, a German soldier, was particularly heart-tugging and added depth to his journey of self-discovery and trust.\n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The apocalyptic chaos of World War I is brought to life through the intimate perspectives of the Iven siblings. The death, despair, and decay are described in a painfully realistic way, making the setting horrifyingly captivating. Despite not typically preferring WW1 stories, the reader was fully invested due to Arden’s masterful portrayal.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  Themes of grief, loss, and the heavy toll of trauma are powerfully explored. The narrative is dark and bleak but not depressing, as it is infused with hope, defiance, and love. The exploration of what people are willing to give up for inner peace is eerily captivating.\n\n- **Magical Realism and Speculative Elements:**  \n  The magical realism elements, introduced through the antagonist, are elusive and up to interpretation. While it took some time to appreciate these elements, they ultimately added a unique layer to the story. The biblical allusions and references, though not fully grasped by the reader, still resonated emotionally.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  Arden’s prose is less flowery than in her Winternight trilogy, but the sparseness of her writing fits perfectly with the narrative, making the emotional beats hit harder. The beauty of her writing lies in its ability to convey deep emotion with simplicity.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The story does not end with a neat, pretty bow, which feels authentic given the context of war and trauma. The characters are left scarred and on a long healing journey, adding to the story’s emotional depth and realism.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKatherine Arden has crafted a tragically beautiful and darkly entrancing WW1 novel in *The Warm Hands of Ghosts*. With its compelling characters, haunting atmosphere, and powerful exploration of grief and trauma, the story is both emotionally resonant and thought-provoking.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Style and Voice:**  \n  Katherine Arden is one of the few authors whose work I will read without hesitation. Her fairy-tale-like prose and unique voice, which I fell in love with in the Winternight trilogy, are present in this book as well. I was so captivated by her style that I picked up this novel without even reading the description.\n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The story is set during World War I, a refreshing change from the more commonly explored World War II setting. I hadn’t read many books about World War I before, and this novel gave me a vivid and emotional understanding of the era. The scenes in the trenches and hospitals were gritty, heartbreaking, and deeply atmospheric, painting a stark picture of the war’s horrors.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot unfolds from the perspectives of Laura Iven, a former field nurse, and her brother, Freddie Iven, a soldier. The dual narrative worked well, and the story moved at a steady pace. The inclusion of ghosts added an intriguing layer to the tale, fitting seamlessly into the narrative and enhancing the overall atmosphere.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Laura and Freddie were fully developed characters, and I found myself invested in their journeys. Their struggles and traumas felt authentic, and their decisions—whether to salvage their world or leave it behind—were compelling and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This was an emotional read that highlighted the destructive and terrible nature of war. The author’s ability to evoke such strong feelings is a testament to her storytelling prowess. The scenes in the trenches and hospitals were particularly moving and left a lasting impression.\n\n- **Author’s Note:**  \n  I highly recommend reading the author’s note at the end of the book. It provided additional context and insights that I found fascinating and enriching.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKatherine Arden has delivered another exceptional novel with this World War I-set story. The combination of her fairy-tale-like prose, well-developed characters, and atmospheric plot made for a gripping and emotional read. The historical context and haunting elements added depth to the narrative, leaving me with a better understanding of the war’s impact.

It follows Laura, who returns to Halifax after being discharged due to a leg injury, and her brother Freddie, who is still fighting in the trenches in Belgium. Laura decides to return to Belgium as a volunteer at a private hospital to uncover the truth about her brother's reported death. The story alternates between Laura's perspective in 1918 and Freddie's perspective in 1917, offering a dual narrative that transports readers to different settings within the war.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters forge unexpected bonds with both allies and enemies as they navigate the horrors of war. Freddie's chapters were more compelling and emotionally heavy, making him the standout character of the book. Laura, while okay, didn’t resonate as strongly as Freddie. The relationships between characters, including a small bit of romance, added depth, though I wished the romance had been more prominent.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel prominently explores themes of grief and hope, which serve as the backbone of the story. The supernatural elements woven into the narrative add a unique layer to the historical setting, though they differ significantly from the fantastical and Slavic fairytale-inspired tone of Arden’s Winternight trilogy.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Katherine Arden’s writing is immersive and evocative, capturing the emotional weight of the war and the personal struggles of the characters. However, the tone of this book is distinct from her previous work, leaning more toward historical fiction with subtle supernatural elements rather than full-blown fantasy.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  Fans of Arden’s Winternight trilogy may enjoy this book, but it’s important to note that it has a completely different tone and focus. While Winternight is fantastical and rooted in Slavic fairytales, The Warm Hands of Ghosts is more grounded in historical realism with a touch of the supernatural.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Warm Hands of Ghosts is a poignant and emotionally charged historical fiction novel that delves into the complexities of war, grief, and hope. While Freddie’s chapters stood out as the most compelling, Laura’s perspective provided a necessary balance to the narrative.

            "The book intertwines two narratives: Laura, a nurse searching for her possibly deceased brother, and her brother, who finds himself stranded in No Man's Land with a German soldier. The brother's storyline, especially his encounters with the enigmatic fiddler, is far more engaging and propels the plot forward. In contrast, Laura's chapters often feel stagnant, leaving me less connected to her journey. The fiddler, a mastermind figure reminiscent of the Goblin King from the Labyrinth, stands out as the most intriguing character. However, Laura's lack of growth and significant action diminishes the impact of her storyline.",
            "If you're seeking character development or depth, this book may not meet your expectations. The protagonist, Laura, lacks the compelling qualities needed to engage readers; her struggles and motivations feel flat. I found her brother's chapters more captivating, particularly due to his interactions with the fiddler. Additionally, the side characters, such as the grieving mother and the doctor who develops feelings for Laura, failed to resonate with me.",

Laura, the protagonist, isn't written to be a compelling character to follow. I found her struggles and motivations somewhat flat, and I would have preferred the focus to be on her brother, whose chapters were more engaging due to his interactions with the fiddler.

The brother's storyline, particularly his encounters with the mysterious fiddler, was more intriguing and felt like the plot was moving forward. However, Laura's chapters often felt stagnant, and I didn't feel as connected to her journey. The fiddler, who serves as a mastermind figure, was the most interesting character, reminiscent of the Labyrinth's Goblin King, but Laura's lack of growth or significant action made her storyline less compelling.  \n\n- **Emotional Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is undeniably depressing, and at times, reading it felt like a chore. While the atmosphere and the sense of despair were well-crafted, the emotional weight didn't always translate into a satisfying reading experience.  \n\n- **Comparison to the Author's Previous Work:**  \n  Compared to the author's trilogy, this book falls short. While it has its merits, I prefer the trilogy for its richer character development and more engaging storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Warm Hands of Ghosts* is a well-written book with a strong atmospheric tone, but it lacks the character depth and emotional resonance of the author's previous work.

            "The plot unfolds slowly and is primarily character-driven, offering limited growth beyond the initial synopsis. Tension and action escalate around the 75% mark, leading to a few reveals, yet the story largely stays within its original premise: an ex-war nurse in search of her lost brother confronts the horrors of WW1 alongside an enemy soldier and encounters a mysterious figure known as The Fiddler.",
            "The characters in this novel felt flat and lacked depth. While Freddie was somewhat likable, Laura's chapters were only tolerable. Neither character came across as fully alive or compelling. The side character, Jones, the war surgeon, was enjoyable but had minimal page time.

            "The writing is beautifully atmospheric, reflecting meticulous research and a deep historical knowledge. The authentic and immersive descriptions enhance the novel's realism.",
            "This novel delves into the horrors of war, the hypocrisy of humanity, and the ambiguous boundaries between good and evil. While the writing is beautiful, the religious and fantastical elements—such as references to the Book of Revelations and The Devil—feel underdeveloped and contribute little more than atmosphere. The exploration of evil and religion could have been much deeper.",
            "The romantic elements in the story were minimal and underdeveloped. Laura's romance felt more authentic than Freddie's, which seemed forced and lacked depth. The relationship between Freddie and Winter, rooted in shared trauma, was insufficiently explored, and their abrupt shift in sexuality felt unrealistic for the 1918 setting. While the story is set against the grim backdrop of WW1's climax, the premise held promise, but the execution ultimately fell short of expectations."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author’s Reputation and Expectations:**  \n  I picked up this book not because the story sounded interesting but because I adore Katherine Arden’s ‘Winternight’ trilogy. I initially read it more because I like the author rather than because I enjoy magical realism, which I don’t.  \n- **Genre and Personal Preference:**  \n  Magical realism isn’t the genre for me personally, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this book.  \n- **Narrative Focus and Structure:**  \n  This is definitely a story that places more emphasis on the journey rather than the destination. Had I been reading with my focus on how everything is resolved, I would have been disappointed and left feeling like, “That’s it?!” By being patient with the exploratory narrative and appreciating the message the story was trying to convey, my reading experience was more enjoyable.  \n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  Katherine Arden’s take on the horrors of WWI fits the style and tone of the story really well.  \n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  This isn’t quite on the same level of loveliness as her ‘Winternight’ trilogy, but it’s still a good book.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  It’s an easy recommendation to those who enjoy war novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite not being a fan of magical realism, I found this book surprisingly enjoyable due to its emphasis on the journey, its thematic depth, and its fitting tone. While it doesn’t reach the same heights as the ‘Winternight’ trilogy, it’s still a solid read and a good recommendation for fans of war novels.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n↠ 3.5 stars"

            "The story follows Laura Iven, a wounded field nurse returning to Halifax, Canada, who embarks on a journey to Belgium to uncover the truth about her brother Freddie's presumed death in World War I. While Freddie survives an explosion, he finds himself in a perilous situation alongside a German soldier, Hans Winter. The narrative employs dual timelines (1918 and 1917) and third-person perspectives for both Laura and Freddie, creating an intriguing structure. However, the execution is hampered by slow pacing and an overly convenient resolution.",
            "In this story, Laura stands out as efficient, assertive, and determined; however, I struggled to empathize with her. Conversely, Freddie's vulnerability and intense emotions make him more relatable. Hans Winter is portrayed as a grumpy, wounded figure, adding some depth to the narrative. Despite their potential, the characters overall lack depth and fail to fully engage the reader.",
            "The author's writing is competent, but the pacing is slow, and the plot often feels contrived. Laura's journey lacks tension, as obstacles are resolved too easily. Although the ending is hopeful, it comes across as rushed and unrealistic. While the author's note offers some insight, it doesn't fully address the book's overall shortcomings.",
            "The book powerfully conveys the desolate atmosphere of war, which is its greatest strength. It explores themes of PTSD, healing, and hope; however, the paranormal elements, linked to Christian concepts such as the Book of Revelation, come across as confusing and underdeveloped. Additionally, the romantic subplot feels forced and detracts from the story's overall potential.",
            "As a fan of the author's previous work, I had high expectations for this standalone novel, but it ultimately fell short. The paranormal elements and religious references were challenging to understand, and the forced romance felt unnecessary. While the book had moments of brilliance, it failed to come together as a cohesive whole."

        "conclusion": "*The Warm Hands of Ghosts* has an intriguing premise and effectively portrays the horrors of war, but it struggles with pacing, character development, and the integration of paranormal elements. While Freddie’s storyline is compelling, Laura’s journey feels underwhelming, and the romantic subplot detracts from the narrative. The book may appeal more to readers familiar with Christian theology, but overall, it falls short of its potential.",

            "This historical fiction novel is set during the Great War in the 1910s, delving into the depths of tragedy and conflict. It follows Laura, who returns to Halifax after being discharged due to a leg injury, and her brother Freddie, who remains in the trenches of Belgium. Determined to uncover the truth behind her brother's reported death, Laura volunteers at a private hospital in Belgium. The narrative alternates between Laura's perspective in 1918 and Freddie's in 1917, creating a dual timeline that enhances the story's depth.",

Freddie's chapters stand out, brimming with intense emotions and a profound connection to his experiences.

His dynamic with Winter, a German soldier, is heartwarming and adds depth to his journey of self-discovery and trust.\n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The apocalyptic chaos of World War I is brought to life through the intimate perspectives of the Iven siblings. The death, despair, and decay are described in a painfully realistic way, making the reader feel almost voyeuristic in witnessing their suffering.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  Themes of grief, loss, and the heavy toll of trauma are powerfully explored. The narrative delves into what people are willing to give up to find inner peace, and the story is filled with hope, defiance, and love, making it more heartwarming than initially expected.\n\n- **Magical Realism:**  \n  The magical realism elements, introduced through the antagonist, are initially challenging to appreciate but ultimately impressive. The biblical allusions and references add deeper layers to the story, though the emotional impact remains strong even without fully grasping them.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  Arden’s prose is less flowery than in her Winternight trilogy, but the sparseness fits the narrative perfectly, making the emotional beats hit harder. The writing is hauntingly beautiful and darkly entrancing.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The story does not end with a neat, pretty bow, which feels authentic given the characters’ deep scars and ongoing healing journey. This realistic conclusion adds to the emotional depth of the novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKatherine Arden has executed her vision for *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* to perfection, creating a tragically beautiful and darkly entrancing World War I story. The novel is filled with atmosphere, emotion, and compelling characters, exploring themes of grief, loss, and trauma with a touch of magical realism. Arden’s writing is hauntingly beautiful, and the story’s realistic ending leaves a lasting impact. This novel is a must-read for those seeking a deeply moving and unforgettable historical fiction experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot unfolds slowly and is primarily character-driven, with minimal development beyond the initial synopsis. While tension and action escalate around the 75% mark, introducing a few twists, the narrative remains tightly focused on its premise: an ex-war nurse on a quest to find her lost brother. As she navigates the horrors of WW1 alongside an opposing soldier, she also encounters a mysterious figure known as The Fiddler.",
            "The characters in this novel felt flat and lacked depth. While Freddie was somewhat likable, Laura's chapters were only tolerable. Neither character came across as fully alive or compelling. The side character, Jones, the war surgeon, was enjoyable but had minimal page time. Overall, the characters in this novel were disappointing compared to the author's previous works.",
            "The writing is beautifully atmospheric, reflecting meticulous research and deep historical knowledge. The authentic and immersive descriptions enhance the novel's strong sense of place.",
            "This novel offers a poignant exploration of war, delving into themes such as its inherent evils, human hypocrisy, and the ambiguous nature of good and evil. While the writing is exquisite, the incorporation of religious and fantastical elements—such as references to the Book of Revelations and The Devil—feels underdeveloped and contributes little beyond atmosphere. The treatment of evil and religion lacks the depth found in the author's earlier works.",

While it succeeds in creating an atmospheric and thought-provoking narrative, it falls short in character development, plot progression, and the execution of its themes and romantic subplots. Despite its flaws, it’s an interesting read, though not as enjoyable as the author’s previous works. I hope her next book is lighter and faster-paced.",

The premise had promise, but the execution fell short of expectations.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters felt flat and lacked depth. Freddie was somewhat likable, but Laura’s chapters were tolerable at best. Neither character felt fully alive or compelling. The side character, Jones (the war surgeon), was enjoyable but had minimal page time. Compared to Arden’s previous works, the characters in this novel were disappointing.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot was slow and largely character-driven, with limited growth beyond the synopsis. The tension and action picked up around the 75% mark, leading to a few reveals, but the story remained confined to its initial premise: an ex-war nurse searching for her lost brother, who navigates the horrors of WW1 alongside an opposition soldier and encounters a mysterious figure called \"The Fiddler.\"\n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The novel serves as a harrowing observation of war, exploring themes like the evils of war, human hypocrisy, and the blurred lines between good and evil. While beautifully written, the inclusion of religious and fantastical elements (e.g., references to the Book of Revelations and \"The Devil\") felt underdeveloped and added little beyond atmosphere. The themes of evil and religion were not explored as effectively as in Arden’s previous works.\n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  The romantic aspects were minimal and underdeveloped. Laura’s romance felt more believable than Freddie’s, which seemed out of place and lacked depth. Freddie and Winter’s romance, born out of shared trauma, was not adequately explored, nor was their sudden change of sexuality, making it feel unrealistic for the 1918 setting.\n\n- **Writing and Research:**  \n  Arden’s writing is beautiful and atmospheric, showcasing her meticulous research and historical knowledge. The descriptions felt authentic and immersive, contributing to the novel’s strong sense of place.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-written but gloomy novel that explores the horrors of war and the nature of evil.

            "The romantic subplot introduced in the latter part of the book feels forced and unnecessary, detracting from a more meaningful exploration of platonic friendships and healing that would have been more appropriate for the context. The pacing is slow, which hampers engagement, and while the alternating timelines are an interesting choice, they don’t always flow seamlessly. The resolution comes across as too convenient and rushed, with the hopeful ending feeling overly simplistic as everything falls into place too easily for Laura. This undermines the stakes and emotional weight of the story. Centered on Laura Iven, a wounded field nurse, and her brother Freddie, who is presumed dead but survives in a war-torn environment, the narrative explores themes of World War I, PTSD, healing, and hope. However, the execution ultimately lacks depth, leaving the plot feeling overly convenient.",
            "Laura is efficient, assertive, and determined, yet she struggles to evoke empathy. In contrast, Freddie's vulnerability and intense emotions make him more relatable. Hans Winter, the German soldier, is adequately portrayed but lacks the depth to be a compelling character.",
            "The book's portrayal of war is strikingly desolate and bleak, serving as its most compelling aspect. However, the paranormal elements, particularly the religious undertones referencing the Book of Revelation, come across as confusing and underdeveloped, especially for readers lacking familiarity with Christian theology."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Warm Hands of Ghosts* has moments of brilliance, particularly in its portrayal of the harsh realities of war and Freddie’s emotional journey. However, the book struggles with pacing, underdeveloped paranormal elements, and a forced romantic subplot. While it has potential, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and impactful narrative. Readers with a deeper understanding of Christian theology may appreciate it more, but overall, it falls short of expectations.",

The dual timelines (1918 and 1917) and the themes of World War I, PTSD, healing, and hope are intriguing. However, the execution falls short, with the plot feeling overly convenient and lacking depth.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Laura is portrayed as efficient, assertive, and determined, but she fails to evoke empathy. Freddie, on the other hand, is more relatable due to his vulnerability and intense emotions. Hans Winter, the German soldier, is decently portrayed but doesn’t stand out as a compelling character.\n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The desolate and bleak depiction of war is well-executed and stands out as the book’s highlight. However, the paranormal elements, particularly the religious undertones (e.g., the Book of Revelation), feel confusing and underdeveloped, especially for readers unfamiliar with Christian theology.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The inclusion of a romantic subplot in the latter part of the book feels forced and unnecessary. It detracts from the potential exploration of platonic friendships and healing, which would have been more fitting given the context.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is slow, which hinders engagement. The alternating timelines, while an interesting choice, don’t always flow seamlessly, and the resolution feels too convenient and rushed.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is hopeful but overly simplistic, with everything falling into place too easily for Laura. This undermines the stakes and emotional weight of the story.\n\n- **Author’s Note:**  \n  The author’s note provides some insight into the inspiration behind the book, but it also highlights the gap between the author’s passion for the topic and the final execution, which feels average at best.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Warm Hands of Ghosts* has moments of brilliance, particularly in its portrayal of the harsh realities of war and Freddie’s emotional journey. However, the book struggles with pacing, underdeveloped paranormal elements, and a forced romantic subplot. While it has potential, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and impactful narrative.

            "This historical fiction novel is set during the Great War in the 1910s, delving into the depths of tragedy and conflict. It follows Laura, who returns to Halifax after being discharged due to a leg injury, while her brother Freddie remains in the trenches of Belgium. Driven by the need to uncover the truth behind Freddie's reported death, Laura volunteers at a private hospital in Belgium. The narrative alternates between Laura's perspective in 1918 and Freddie's experiences in 1917, creating a compelling dual storyline that immerses readers in the brutal realities of war.",
            "The characters forge unexpected connections with both allies and adversaries as they confront the horrors of war. Freddie's chapters are particularly compelling, establishing him as the standout character of the book. In contrast, Laura's perspective, while solid, lacks the same emotional resonance. Additionally, the novel features a minor romantic subplot that I felt could have been more developed.",
            "The author's writing is both evocative and immersive, yet the tone of *The Warm Hands of Ghosts* diverges significantly from her Winternight trilogy. While the Winternight series is steeped in fantastical elements and Slavic fairytales, this novel adopts a more grounded, historical approach, interwoven with subtle supernatural nuances.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Style and Prose:**  \n  Katherine Arden is one of the few authors whose work I will read without hesitation. Her fairy-tale-like prose and unique voice, which I fell in love with in the Winternight trilogy, are present in this book as well. I was so captivated by her style that I picked up this novel solely based on her name, without even reading the description.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The story is set during World War I, a refreshing change from the more commonly explored World War II setting in novels. I hadn’t read many books about World War I before this, and the book gave me a vivid and emotional understanding of the era. The scenes in the trenches and hospitals were gritty, heartbreaking, and deeply atmospheric, painting a stark picture of the war’s destruction and trauma.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot unfolds from the perspectives of two well-developed characters, Laura Iven and her brother, Freddie Iven. The story moves at a steady pace, balancing tension and emotion effectively. The inclusion of ghosts added an intriguing layer to the narrative, fitting seamlessly into the tale and enhancing its depth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Laura and Freddie were fully realized characters, and I found myself invested in their journeys. Their struggles and traumas felt authentic, and their decisions—whether to salvage their world or leave it behind—were compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This was an emotional read that left a lasting impression. The horrors of war, the bonds formed in the face of adversity, and the haunting atmosphere all contributed to a powerful and moving story.  \n\n- **Author’s Note:**  \n  I highly recommend reading the author’s note at the end of the book. It provided additional context and insight that I found fascinating and enriching.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKatherine Arden has delivered another exceptional novel, blending historical fiction with elements of the supernatural to create a gripping and atmospheric tale. The vivid portrayal of World War I, the well-developed characters, and the emotional depth make this a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
