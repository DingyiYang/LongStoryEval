With an intriguing premise, Blythe pretends to be Julian's mistress to deflect unwanted advances, effectively setting the stage for their evolving connection.",

The romance is fun, sexy, and sincere, culminating in a nontraditional happily ever after that perfectly suits the characters.",

However, the ending strays from the typical Happily Ever After, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and uncertain about Blythe's future. While the rationale behind the conclusion is understandable, it comes across as naive and short-sighted, as it seems unlikely that their relationship would remain undiscovered. Additionally, portraying Blythe as a kept woman rather than exploring a more traditional or socially acceptable path feels problematic, especially given the historical context.",
            "Blythe is a captivating bluestocking and working-class heroine with a passion for restoring paintings, a skill she inherited from her uncle. She embodies strength and independence. In contrast, Julian, the hero, occasionally comes across as weaker and one-dimensional. His grief often overshadows his character, making him overly dependent on his relationship with Blythe for emotional support.",

These elements added depth and intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really liked the hero and heroine, as well as the hero‚Äôs daughter, who is also the heroine‚Äôs best friend. The heroine stood out because she had a career/trade she was skilled at and passionate about, which added a refreshing layer to her character. However, I would‚Äôve appreciated a bit more background on the main characters to better understand their motivations and histories.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was fun and hot, with a historical setting that worked well. While I enjoyed the unconventional ending and the assurance of a happily-ever-after (HEA), I felt the plot could have been expanded slightly to provide more depth and development.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the minor desire for more background and plot, I found the novella to be really good for what it was. It left me excited to read more from this author in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis historical novella was an enjoyable read with engaging tropes, likable characters, and a satisfying HEA. While I wished for a bit more character background and plot development, it was a fun and hot story that left me eager to explore more of the author‚Äôs work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
