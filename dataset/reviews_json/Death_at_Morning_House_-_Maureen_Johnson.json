            "This novel is a gripping YA mystery that weaves together two timelines, shifting between the perspectives of Morning House's original inhabitants and the present-day protagonist, Marlowe. The author skillfully navigates two compelling mysteries set almost a century apart, while delving into complex themes of friendship, love, and family dynamics. Although the pacing begins slowly, it accelerates around the 100-page mark, revealing a series of twists and secrets that maintain suspense. The meticulous attention to detail, rich clues, vivid imagery, and an ever-present sense of unease ultimately make the deliberate beginning rewarding.",
            "Marlowe, the protagonist, is both quirky and relatable, making her an endearing character that’s easy to root for. Her awkward charm shines throughout the story, particularly in her blossoming friendship with Riki, a sharply witty and cynical companion. Their dynamic was a highlight, leaving me eager for more tales of them solving crimes together. The supporting cast is equally intriguing, filled with secrets and personal motivations that kept me guessing about everyone’s true intentions. I appreciated being surprised by the two major mysteries, as I couldn’t solve them despite my attempts.",

Her awkwardness and charm made her a character I couldn’t help but root for.  \n   - The romance subplot and Marlowe’s blossoming friendship with Riki, a sharply witty and cynical character, were highlights. I could easily imagine reading an entire series of these two solving crimes.  \n   - The supporting cast was intriguing, with secrets and personal motivations that kept me suspicious of everyone. Despite multiple guesses, I couldn’t correctly solve either of the big mysteries, which was a pleasant surprise.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel is unputdownable, with a foreboding sense of unease and atmospheric visuals that added depth to the story.  \n   - Maureen Johnson’s clever storytelling and attention to detail made the book a standout.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This is a standalone mystery that kept me hooked until the very last page. I can see why Maureen Johnson is described as the Queen of Mystery.  \n   - Armchair detectives and Agatha Christie fans who enjoy being kept on their toes should consider adding this to their TBR.  \n   - I plan to reread the book to fully digest all the little details I missed the first time around and will be adding all of Johnson’s backlist titles to my TBR.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAn unputdownable, plot-twisty YA mystery with a relatable protagonist, intriguing supporting characters, and cleverly interwoven timelines.

Her voice was engaging and funny, and I enjoyed reading from her perspective.  \n\n- **Dual Timelines and Plot Structure:**  \n  The dual timelines were a highlight for me.

However, I felt the reveal in the 1930s timeline could have had a greater emotional impact if I had known the characters better.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wished I got to know the characters more deeply. While Marlowe was well-developed, the other characters felt surface-level, and I only had a basic understanding of the people she spent her summer with.  \n\n- **Mystery and Resolution:**  \n  The crimes were laid out clearly by the end, but the motivations behind the events in the 1930s timeline remained murky, which was slightly frustrating.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works**  \n   - As a longtime fan of Maureen Johnson's Truly Devious series, I was initially disappointed that *Death at Morning House* wasn’t the sixth book in the series. However, Marlowe Wexler, the new protagonist, quickly won me over.  \n   - Marlowe shares some traits with Stevie (from the Truly Devious series), such as a knack for solving mysteries and a quirky nervousness, but she feels fresh and distinct.  \n   - The supporting characters in this book felt more nuanced and less like caricatures compared to some in the Truly Devious series.  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - Marlowe is clever, observant, and endearingly awkward. Unlike Stevie, she doesn’t actively seek out mysteries but is drawn into one after a social mishap. Her relatability makes her a standout protagonist.  \n   - The group of teens Marlowe works with on the island are well-developed, with distinct personalities and secrets that add depth to the story. Riki, with her excellent socks and key role in solving the mystery, was my favorite, followed closely by Van for his *immaculate vibes*.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot**  \n   - The romantic storyline, centered on Marlowe’s crush on her co-worker Akilah, is present but not overpowering. It adds charm without detracting from the main plot, which I found refreshing.  \n\n- **Dual Timeline Narrative**  \n   - The novel features a dual timeline, alternating between Marlowe’s modern-day story and the 1930s perspective of Clara Ralston, one of the Ralston children.  \n   - The historical timeline explores the tragic lives of the Ralston family under their eugenicist father’s oppressive rule. While less “fun” than Marlowe’s story, it’s heartbreaking and captivating, with a conclusion I found even more satisfying than the modern timeline’s resolution.  \n\n- **Mystery and Pacing**  \n   - The mystery is well-crafted, with subtle hints and red herrings that keep the reader guessing. Maureen Johnson excels at doling out answers gradually, making the story engaging and unpredictable.  \n   - Even though one of the reveals aligned with my theories, there were enough twists to keep me thoroughly invested.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere**  \n   - The isolated island setting, combined with the eerie history of the Ralston family, creates a compelling backdrop for the story. The summer camp vibes gone sideways add to the novel’s unique charm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is a fresh and captivating mystery that showcases Maureen Johnson’s storytelling prowess. With a relatable protagonist, a well-balanced romantic subplot, and a dual timeline that adds depth, this novel is a must-read for fans of Johnson’s work and mystery lovers alike.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting:**  \n   - The author excels at creating immersive settings. The Thousand Islands (or 1800 islands) setting was captivating and well-executed.  \n\n- **Dual Timeline Structure:**  \n   - The novel features two distinct timelines: a modern-day story and a past story set in 1932.  \n   - I expected more clever interweaving between the two timelines, but they remained largely separate, which was a slight disappointment.  \n\n- **Modern-Day Storyline:**  \n   - The modern-day cast consists of six kids and their supervisor on the island, each with distinct, easy-to-remember personalities.  \n   - Little details were scattered throughout to help readers solve the \"whodunnit\" (I successfully guessed it!).  \n   - The main character, Marlowe, is well-written as a relatable teenager who makes mistakes and fumbles over words.  \n   - The motive behind the crime in the modern-day storyline felt weak and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Past Storyline (1932):**  \n   - The past storyline features a closed cast of seven kids, parents, and an aunt in the same house.  \n   - The eerie atmosphere and the gradual revelation of the father's unsettling nature were particularly compelling.  \n   - The \"whodunnit\" reveal in this timeline was satisfying, and the motive was well-explained.  \n   - Clues were subtly placed, making it challenging to solve on the first read but rewarding for a potential reread.  \n   - The storytelling in the past timeline felt less developed compared to the modern-day one, with only three characters (Clara, her father, and Max) receiving significant focus.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Characters in both timelines were distinct and interesting, with Marlowe in the modern-day and Clara, her father, and Max in the past standing out.  \n\n- **Plot Integration:**  \n   - I was surprised that the main character from the modern-day storyline did not play a role in solving the past mystery. The two timelines felt more like separate stories than interconnected narratives.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the lack of integration between the timelines, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was hooked by the end.  \n   - The standalone nature of the novel works well for a YA whodunnit, as it avoids stretching the believability of a teenager solving multiple crimes.  \n\n- **Author's Style and Previous Works:**  \n   - I requested this book because I loved the author's previous works, and this one did not disappoint.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling YA whodunnit with strong settings, well-developed characters, and intriguing dual timelines. While the lack of integration between the timelines was a minor drawback, the overall storytelling and atmosphere kept me engaged. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating was provided, but the review conveys a highly positive impression."

            "The plot of *Nine Liars* feels thinner, featuring two disconnected mysteries—one from the past and one from the present—that lack effective intertwining. The current-day investigation into Chris's death and Dr. Henson's murder becomes convoluted and less engaging, primarily due to an overwhelming number of characters. Although the Ralston family’s backstory is intriguing, it is overshadowed by the present-day drama. The epilogue introduces a podcast about the Ralston murders, which could have served as a more compelling framing device. Overall, the book often reads like two separate stories sharing a setting, with the past and present narratives failing to fully integrate. The pacing suffers from the numerous characters and subplots, making it difficult to remain invested in the various threads.",
            "Marlowe, the protagonist, stands out from Stevie Bell with her engaging first-person narration and snarky tone, which I found enjoyable. However, the supporting characters, particularly Marlowe's group of friends, feel underdeveloped. Chris, the deceased, embodies both kindness and selfishness, but by the time his murderer is revealed, I was not invested in the outcome. The Ralston family’s storyline is intriguing, especially Victory’s troubling descent into eugenics-fueled madness, yet it feels disconnected from the present-day plot.",
            "Set against the atmospheric backdrop of one of the Thousand Islands, *Morning House* is steeped in macabre history, making it an ideal setting for a murder mystery. The intriguing backstory, which includes a family curse and the tragic deaths of the Ralston children, enriches the narrative and adds depth to the story.",
            "I was eager to get my hands on a physical copy of the book and chose not to request an ARC, but unfortunately, the library's copy arrived before my own, which was frustrating. I initially thought it was another Stevie Bell adventure, but I soon learned it was a standalone novel. The cover and overall vibe reminded me of a particular style, likely a result of marketing efforts."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite its flaws, this is a 4.5-star read for me. I love the author’s snarky narrators, and Marlowe’s voice is distinct and engaging. The Ralston family’s story is fascinating, though it gets overshadowed by the less compelling present-day mystery. While the plot could have been stronger with better integration of past and present, the atmospheric setting and the author’s signature wit make it an enjoyable read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Expectations and Initial Impressions:**\n   - I was excited to get a physical copy of the book and didn’t request an ARC. However, the library’s copy arrived before my purchased one, which was frustrating.\n   - Initially, I assumed this was another Stevie Bell adventure, but it turned out to be a standalone novel. The cover and vibe are reminiscent of the Stevie series, likely due to marketing efforts.\n\n- **Comparison to the Stevie Bell Series:**\n   - The book shares similarities with *Truly Devious*: a plucky teenage detective, flashbacks to a century-old crime, a present-day crime, and a cast of quirky supporting characters.\n   - The supporting characters here are less fleshed out compared to Nate and Janelle from the Stevie series, though the love interests are less annoying than David.\n   - I often felt this story could have been a Stevie Bell adventure, especially with the murder house setting. However, transplanting Stevie into this plot might have felt forced without her usual crew.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Strengths:**\n   - The plot feels thinner compared to *Nine Liars*, with two unconnected mysteries (past and present) that don’t intertwine as effectively.\n   - The present-day mystery involving the death of Chris and the murder of Dr. Henson feels convoluted and less engaging, especially with too many characters to care about.\n   - The Ralston family’s backstory is intriguing but gets overshadowed by the present-day drama. The epilogue reveals a podcast about the Ralston murders, which could have been a stronger framing device.\n\n- **Characterization and Narration:**\n   - Marlowe, the protagonist, is distinct from Stevie Bell, thanks to her first-person narration and snarky tone, which I enjoyed.\n   - The supporting characters, particularly the group of friends Marlowe joins, are underdeveloped. Chris, the deceased, is portrayed as both kind and selfish, but by the time his murderer is revealed, I didn’t care much.\n   - The Ralston family’s story is compelling, especially Victory’s descent into eugenics-fueled madness, but it feels disconnected from the present-day plot.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The setting of Morning House on one of the Thousand Islands is atmospheric and rich with macabre history, making it perfect for a murder mystery.\n   - The house’s backstory, including the family curse and the tragic deaths of the Ralston children, adds depth and allure to the setting.\n\n- **Pacing and Execution:**\n   - The book sometimes feels like two separate stories set in the same location, with the past and present narratives not fully integrated.\n   - The pacing suffers due to the sheer number of characters and subplots, making it hard to stay invested in all the threads.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its flaws, this is a 4.5-star read for me. I love Maureen Johnson’s snarky narrators, and Marlowe’s voice is distinct and engaging. The Ralston family’s story is fascinating, though it gets overshadowed by the less compelling present-day mystery. While the plot could have been stronger with better integration of past and present, the atmospheric setting and Johnson’s signature wit make it an enjoyable read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5 stars."

            "The story centers on Marlowe, a high schooler who inadvertently burns down a house she’s caring for, resulting in a summer job at Morning House. This place carries a haunting legacy tied to its original eccentric and tragic owners. The father, a proponent of eugenics, adopted six children, leading to a series of family tragedies, including the untimely deaths of the youngest child and one of the older sisters. As Marlowe delves deeper into her surroundings, she uncovers hidden truths about her co-workers and island residents, alongside the rift caused by the death of someone who should have been present.",

            "This gripping YA mystery/suspense novel captivated me from the very beginning. The narrative alternates between Marlowe's present-day perspective and compelling flashbacks that delve into the tragic history of a wealthy family at Morning House. Both timelines are equally intriguing, exploring themes of parenthood, wealth, prejudice, individuality versus conformity, and nature versus nurture.

While the timelines didn’t heavily intersect until the end, both were equally engaging and came together seamlessly.  \n  - The mystery surrounding the deaths of the Ralston children in the past and the tensions among the tour guides in the present kept me hooked. Each chapter revealed more information and raised new questions, with tiny cliffhangers at every timeline switch that made it hard to put the book down.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - In the present timeline, Marlowe was a relatable and endearing protagonist. Her self-doubt after accidentally setting a fire and her awkwardness with the other tour guides made her feel real. Her connection with Riki, another outsider, was particularly compelling.  \n  - The dynamics among the tour guides (April, Liani, Van, Tom, and Riki) were well-developed, with just enough tension to keep things interesting.  \n  - In the past timeline, the Ralston family was fascinating. Father Phillip’s strictness, the adopted children’s adherence to his rules, and Max’s rebelliousness added layers to the story. The shifting perspectives among the children kept the mystery alive and made the past timeline feel well-rounded.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Maureen Johnson’s writing is witty, humorous, and easy to read, even with the darker mystery and thriller elements. The banter and humor balanced the tension perfectly.  \n  - The pacing was excellent, with each chapter building on the last and keeping me fully engaged.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  - The story wrapped up perfectly, with both timelines coming together in a way that made complete sense. The resolution was satisfying and left me wanting to read more about these characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a fantastic read, blending mystery, humor, and rich character development. The dual timelines, immersive setting, and Maureen Johnson’s engaging writing style made it impossible to put down. The story wrapped up beautifully, and I would love to revisit these characters in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 5/5  \n- Plot: 5/5  \n- Characters: 5/5  \n- Writing Style: 5/5  \n- Ending: 5/5"

            "I appreciated the dual timeline structure, which enriched the narrative with firsthand accounts from the Ralston household in the 1930s. The subtle details laid the groundwork for the story's conclusion. Meanwhile, the present-day timeline, focusing on Marlowe and Riki's investigation into a mysterious death, created intriguing parallels. I thrive on these connections in dual timeline stories, and this one delivered excellently. The resolution was satisfying; all loose ends were neatly tied up, particularly Marlowe's character arc.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the diverse cast of characters in this book. Despite being teenagers, their emotions were relatable, making each character feel unique and integral to the story. Marlowe, the socially awkward protagonist, particularly stood out with her impressive character development. I admired how she transformed from a timid individual to someone who takes charge of her own destiny, aided by Riki.",
            "While Marlowe's narration occasionally comes across as obnoxious and cringeworthy, it truly reflects her personality, and overall, I found her quite likable. However, some elements were over-explained or repeated unnecessarily. Additionally, the story grew a bit overdramatic towards the end, leaving me wondering why the teenagers were on the island unsupervised. Despite these flaws, it remained an engaging story.",

            "This book’s love interest truly stands out in the YA genre. While I've never been a fan of David and Stevie as a couple, Marlowe's romantic storyline was refreshing and well-crafted. I won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but I appreciated how that narrative unfolded. However, I found the mystery lacking compared to previous *Truly Devious* books, including the standalones, which had more captivating plots. This particular mystery could have benefited from a more drawn-out approach, as I wasn't as invested in either the historical or present-day murder.",

There were things I enjoyed about both series, but some aspects were more enjoyable in this one.  \n  - Like the Stevie Bell series, *Death at Morning House* features a big old mansion filled with secrets, tunnels, and great places to hide a body. I love that kind of setting, and it will always be a hit with me.  \n  - Johnson does a great job of guiding the reader through the perspectives of individuals in the present day as well as almost a century ago, similar to *Truly Devious*, which makes for great storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Unlike the *Truly Devious* series, I liked Marlowe about 10x better than Stevie. I loved her voice and overall attitude. Stevie has merit and complexities, but Marlowe was a much more enjoyable character to get into the headspace of.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  - I found the love interest in this book to be incredibly fascinating for a YA novel. I’ve never been a fan of David and Stevie together in the *Truly Devious* series, but Marlowe’s love interest situation was refreshing and well-executed. I won’t elaborate further due to spoilers, but I really liked how that story came together.  \n\n- **Mystery Plot:**  \n  - The only ding on this book, for me, was the mystery. All of the *Truly Devious* books, even the standalones, had more intriguing mysteries than this one. Perhaps this mystery needed to be drawn out more to be more tantalizing, but I wasn’t as invested in the historical or present-day murder.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Death at Morning House* is a strong addition to the genre, with a captivating setting, well-developed characters, and a refreshing romantic subplot. While the mystery didn’t quite live up to the *Truly Devious* series for me, the book still delivered an enjoyable reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

            "*Death at Morning House* tells the haunting story of a family of seven in 1932, grappling with the mysterious deaths of two siblings on the same tragic day—the youngest drowns, while the eldest falls from a balcony. Only one child survives into old age, while the others meet untimely fates. Morning House, where the family resides, is at the heart of the tale, steeped in its own history of murders from the late 1930s or early 1940s. The narrative skillfully weaves between past and present; while the transitions are clear in the text, they can be somewhat confusing in the audiobook format. Ultimately, the ending is satisfying, tying up all loose ends and providing a compelling resolution that leaves readers content.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Writing Style:**  \n  - I’m not typically a fan of historical fiction, and Johnson’s historical prologues initially throw me off, but I eventually get into them. I actually really enjoy the way she writes the past.  \n  - Johnson maintains a slightly goofy writing style throughout the novel, even with the presence of murder and danger, which I find engaging.  \n\n- **Characters and Representation:**  \n  - The main character is a sapphic, absolutely useless, hilarious, and seemingly neurodivergent lesbian. I love her, and being in her head is incredibly fun.  \n  - Johnson has improved significantly in writing love interests compared to her previous works (e.g., Stevie Bell). The sapphic love triangle in this book is well-handled and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Mystery and Atmosphere:**  \n  - Johnson excels at creating a spooky atmosphere in her mysteries. I got genuinely creeped out and wouldn’t recommend reading this alone at night.  \n  - The twists and turns in the plot are so compelling that they made me want to reread the entire book, which is a testament to its quality.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - I highly recommend this book. It left me with a bit of a book hangover, which speaks to how much I enjoyed it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation with historical fiction, I found myself thoroughly engrossed in this novel. The quirky writing style, well-developed sapphic characters, and expertly crafted spooky mystery made it a standout read. The twists were so gripping that I almost wanted to start over immediately. Overall, it’s a highly enjoyable book that I would recommend to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The use of flashbacks every few chapters makes you want to keep reading to find out what really happened all those years ago.  \n\n- **Setting and Inspiration:**  \n  I live in WNY and have been to the Thousand Islands a few times. I can easily see how the Islands were the inspiration for the story. I really think that Morning House must have been inspired by Boldt Castle and the other old-money mansions.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Appeal:**  \n  If you are a fan of the Truly Devious series by Maureen Johnson, I highly recommend you dive into her newest story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating read, especially for fans of Maureen Johnson's Truly Devious series.

It weaves together two timelines, each presenting compelling, complex cases that intersect in intriguing ways. The author excels at surprising the reader, leading them through a captivating journey that pays off brilliantly. The twists are chillingly effective, and while the resolution feels inevitable, its details remain delightfully unexpected.

In contrast, the 1920s storyline exudes an eerie quality, marked by rigid routines and a peculiar family dynamic that hints at deeper mysteries. The shifting perspectives in this timeline add new dimensions to previously established events, enriching the narrative.",

The sapphic representation in her relationship adds levity and hope, capturing the authentic messiness of teenage love.",

Initially, the story doesn't present itself as a mystery, but hints about events from a century ago suggest something is amiss.

She stumbles on something and ends up working things out by the end.  \n  - It’s not presented as a mystery at first, but the reader will pick up that something isn’t quite right with the events 100 years ago.  \n  - The mystery takes place in the present day when the adult supervising Marlowe and the other teenage tour guides suddenly goes missing, and there’s definitely some odd tension Marlowe picks up on among the group of friends she’s joined for the summer.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Marlowe herself seems to have a strong voice, and I enjoyed reading things from her perspective.  \n  - The characters themselves are all kind of parodies of characters that the author has used in other books, but it was fine and didn’t bother me too much.  \n  - The Ralston patriarch is a controlling ass who believes in eugenics, which is enough to get anyone reading to despise this guy.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  - Johnson truly knows how to weave a mystery, and this one was juicy.  \n  - Her prose flowed well, the humor is good, and the storytelling is great.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - I started reading this while I was reading *Nine Liars*, the 5th book of the Stevie Bell mysteries, and honestly, I enjoyed this one much more.  \n  - Better than *Nine Liars*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an excellent, engaging read with a well-structured mystery that keeps you hooked.

            "The story presents two interconnected mysteries set in a haunted mansion, linking tragedies from 1932 to the present. Marlowe, a tour guide at Morning House, finds herself amid rising tension as another death occurs, compelling her to uncover the truth. The plot is fast-paced and adeptly crafted, featuring a familiar mystery-solving approach but with more relatable characters. A well-meaning joke by Marlowe aimed at Akilah leads to a catastrophic fire, isolating her and adding emotional depth. Suspicion also surrounds Riki's fixation on the Ralston history and Belinda Henson's manipulative actions, intensifying interpersonal conflicts. As Marlowe navigates these dangers, the risk to her life raises the stakes and keeps the reader thoroughly engaged.",
            "I found a deep connection with the characters, particularly Marlowe Wexler, who is quirky, intelligent, and unique. Riki, the brooding goth girl, and Van, the flamboyant free spirit, reflect my own awkwardness and individuality. Marlowe stands out as a sweeter and more engaging character compared to Stevie Bell from Truly Devious. She is self-deprecating, shy, queer, clumsy, and kind-hearted, with a photographic memory and keen intellect that aid her in solving mysteries.",
            "Morning House, the renovated mansion on Ralston Island, exudes an eerie atmosphere, seemingly haunted by the ghosts of the Ralston family. The family's health-obsessed lifestyle and tragic deaths contribute depth and intrigue to the setting."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This is an entertaining, fast-paced, and smartly executed YA mystery that I highly recommend. The relatable characters, eerie setting, and well-crafted plot kept me hooked from start to finish. I especially loved Marlowe’s character and hope to see her return in future installments.",

She’s self-deprecating, shy, queer, clumsy, and good-hearted, with a photographic memory and sharp intellect that help her solve mysteries.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Structure:**  \n   - The story features two intertwined mysteries set in the same haunted mansion theme, with connections between tragedies from 1932 and the present day.  \n   - Marlowe’s journey as a tour guide at Morning House adds tension, especially when another death occurs, and she becomes entangled in uncovering the truth.  \n   - The plot is fast-paced and smartly executed, with a semi-similar mystery-solving concept to the Truly Devious series but with more likable characters.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - Morning House, the renovated mansion on Ralston Island, is eerie and feels haunted by the ghosts of the Ralston family, creating a chilling atmosphere.  \n   - The history of the Ralston family, including their health-obsessed lifestyle and tragic deaths, adds depth and intrigue to the setting.  \n\n- **Conflict and Tension:**  \n   - Marlowe’s well-intentioned jest for Akilah leads to a disastrous fire, turning her into a pariah and adding emotional conflict.  \n   - Suspicion arises with Riki’s obsession with the Ralston history and Belinda Henson’s manipulative behavior, creating interpersonal tension.  \n   - The risk to Marlowe’s life as she uncovers the truth heightens the stakes and keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n   - The mystery-solving concept is reminiscent of the Truly Devious series, but the characters in this book are more likable (e.g., no character as annoying as David).  \n   - Marlowe’s personality and approach to solving mysteries differ from Stevie Bell’s, making her a refreshing protagonist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an entertaining, fast-paced, and smartly executed YA mystery that I highly recommend. The relatable characters, eerie setting, and well-crafted plot kept me hooked from start to finish. I especially loved Marlowe’s character and hope to see her return in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall enjoyment: Highly recommended!  \n- Thanks to NetGalley and HarperCollins Children Books/HarperTeen for providing this unputdownable read."

My theories about the Ralston family's deaths evolved; although I misidentified the culprits, I accurately deduced the motive. The reveal was heart-wrenching, demonstrating the author's storytelling prowess, even though I anticipated the outcome.",

This new story stands apart from *Truly Devious*, sharing only a young female protagonist and a historical mystery. I found Marlowe, the protagonist, refreshingly distinct from Stevie. While Marlowe is a bit of a mess and self-deprecating, her relatability makes her feel authentic without becoming irritating.",
            "Morning House, while not literally haunted, exudes a distinct personality and rich history. Its isolated location on an island enhances the atmosphere of unease and intrigue. I particularly enjoyed the locked-room mystery aspect and the overall ambiance of the setting.",
            "This book's humor was a standout feature. The author's talent for subtle and sarcastic wit resonated with me, resulting in numerous moments that had me chuckling and saying \"mood.\" The effective blend of mystery and comedy kept me thoroughly engaged."

Overall, it felt underdeveloped.",

This book felt more grounded compared to the Truly Devious series, where Stevie and co. lead a luxurious, fictitious life solving mysteries in a private school. Marlowe, the main character here, is a basic teen in an old mansion, which makes her more relatable and palatable at times. The rest of the group also feels like your average teens, which contrasts with the more extravagant Devious group.  \n\n- **Main Character (Marlowe):**  \n  Marlowe is quickly charming and fun to tag alongside. Her grounded nature and relatability make her a strong protagonist.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The location and setting were great. The old mansion, riddled with ghostly stories from its past, creates an intriguing and immersive atmosphere.  \n\n- **Mystery Concept and Execution:**  \n  Johnson churns out two mysteries in one story—one from the past and one in the present. The mystery concept itself is engaging, but the clues are not straightforward. Both the reader and the main character must rely on surmising suspicious \"could be\" scenarios to piece together what happened. While this adds depth, I genuinely wish there were more tangible clues or facts to follow, as it would have made solving the mystery more satisfying.  \n\n- **Solvability and Clues:**  \n  The mystery is solvable, but the lack of concrete clues makes it challenging. I had great guesses but not enough solid facts to work with, which left me feeling less confident about my conclusions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Coherence:**  \n  The plot is coherent and well-structured, with a good balance between the old and new timelines. However, the new timeline felt less compelling in terms of mystery and fear factor.  \n\n- **Fear Factor and Suspense:**  \n  The fear factor was low, even when characters were in danger. It didn’t feel as believable or intense as it could have been.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance was decent, scoring a 3.5/5 in the new timeline. It added a layer to the story without overpowering the mystery.  \n\n- **Audio Narration:**  \n  The audio reader was excellent, scoring 4/5 in the old timeline and 4.5/5 in the new timeline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is one of my favorite mysteries this year, possibly even surpassing *The Reappearance of Rachel Price*. While the lack of concrete clues and solvability was a drawback, I had a lot of fun reading it. The grounded characters, intriguing setting, and dual-timeline mystery made it a memorable read.

While she may not be as intense about her mystery-solving as Stevie Bell, she encapsulates much of the true awkward teenage experience that lends itself to young adult fiction.  \n  - Marlowe adds a piece of reality for young adult readers (e.g., she accidentally started a fire on a first date).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - This was a great, quick, fun, summer mystery read.  \n  - I hope Johnson takes this energy back to the *Truly Devious* series whenever she returns to it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is a delightful return to the charm and fun of Maureen Johnson's storytelling.

            "This novel presents a captivating mystery woven through a dual timeline, with the historical chapters particularly compelling. It follows Marlowe Wexler, who, after a disastrous date, takes a job at a grand historical home. As she delves into the home's past, including its former owner, Dr. Phillip Ralston, she uncovers the tragedy that unfolded there in the 1920s. This dark history enriches the narrative, adding both depth and emotional resonance.",
            "The characters in the modern timeline are intriguing and well-developed, making them enjoyable to get to know. However, I found myself wishing for more depth with the characters from the past timeline, as their story is compelling enough to stand on its own as excellent historical fiction.",
            "The quote, “The past looks better when it’s a little blurry. Soft focus. That’s how we like our past. That’s why we never learn,” resonated with me as a powerful commentary on the romanticization of history. This theme is skillfully integrated into the narrative."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The novel is a great mystery that intertwines a dual timeline, with the past chapters being particularly engaging. The story revolves around Marlowe Wexler, who leaves town after a disastrous date to work at a grand historical home. She learns about the home's history, its past owner, Dr. Phillip Ralston, and the tragedy that occurred there in the 1920s. The mystery is rooted in some horrible history, which adds depth and emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters in the modern timeline are interesting and well-developed, and I enjoyed getting to know them. However, I wished for more time with the characters from the past timeline, as their story felt compelling enough to stand on its own as a great historical fiction.  \n\n- **Genre Blend:**  \n  The book is special because it blends multiple genres, including mystery and historical fiction, seamlessly. This combination adds richness and variety to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Writing and Themes:**  \n  The quote, “The past looks better when it’s a little blurry. Soft focus. That’s how we like our past. That’s why we never learn,” stood out to me as a poignant reflection on how history is often romanticized or obscured. This theme is woven effectively into the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is a compelling mystery with a dual timeline that skillfully blends historical fiction and mystery genres. While the modern timeline characters are engaging, the past timeline characters and their story are particularly captivating and could have been expanded further. The novel’s exploration of history and its emotional impact makes it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5 stars)"

Both timelines are equally engaging, with twists and turns that interconnect effectively. The pacing is well-balanced, making it a compelling standalone mystery.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  Fire is a recurring theme, used creatively to provide dark comedic relief. The author also attempts to incorporate commentary against eugenics, though this aspect felt underdeveloped and somewhat half-hashed.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The location of the murders, Morning House, is vividly brought to life, almost becoming a character itself. The haunting lore and historical descriptions of the house immerse the reader, making it easy to visualize and feel present in the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Marlowe, the protagonist, is relatable and well-crafted, though she doesn’t quite measure up to Stevie Bell (a reference to another character by the author). Her mishaps, like accidentally setting a house on fire during her first date, add a layer of humor and vulnerability to her character.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is a solid YA mystery/thriller, blending suspense, humor, and a touch of darkness. The tone is consistent, and the narrative keeps the reader engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis standalone mystery by Johnson is a well-paced and intriguing read, with alternating timelines that enhance the suspense. While the commentary on eugenics feels underdeveloped, the vivid setting, recurring themes, and relatable protagonist make it a strong addition to the YA mystery/thriller genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This structure keeps the narrative engaging and layered.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The author has a tendency to introduce a sulky, quirky character who is initially disliked by the friend group but eventually becomes a love interest. For example, when a character’s first line to the protagonist is something like, “Why are you staring at my knees?” it’s a clear sign they’ll have a significant romantic moment later.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  The characters in this novel are notably more likable compared to those in *Truly Devious*. Riki, in particular, stands out as a much more compelling character than David, and the sapphic dynamic adds an extra layer of appeal.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  This book is a significant improvement over *Truly Devious*. The characters are more engaging, and the story feels fresher and more enjoyable. While I read all five books in the *Truly Devious* series, I found this standalone (or potential series) far superior and would prefer it to be expanded into a series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMaureen Johnson delivers a compelling split-time mystery with likable characters and a refreshing sapphic romance.

The tone is engaging and humorous, making the reading experience enjoyable.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book is a dual-timeline mystery, which I found captivating. If you love a good mystery with intertwined timelines, you’ll have a great time with this novel.  \n\n- **Appeal to Fans and New Readers:**  \n  If you’re a fan of Stevie Bell (from Maureen’s previous works), you’ll love this book. However, even if you have no history with Maureen’s books, the story stands strong on its own and is accessible to new readers.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I read the last half of the book as it was intended: buzzed off a margarita on a summer afternoon. This added to the fun and immersive experience, making it a perfect summer read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a witty, engaging, and humorous YA murder mystery with a dual-timeline structure. It appeals to both longtime fans of Maureen’s work and new readers who enjoy a well-crafted mystery. The reading experience is enhanced by its lighthearted tone, making it an ideal summer read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I found the main character, Marlowe, somewhat irritating, particularly her tendency to define her entire personality by being \"different.\" The chapter detailing her exceptional lipstick usage felt superfluous. Additionally, Marlowe's talent for solving mysteries was only introduced in the last 50 pages, which came across as poor writing.

Her viewpoint enriches the story, adding depth and authenticity. However, the present-day side characters could benefit from further development. The past revelations are more impactful, as the potential suspects from that era possess greater depth and background.

McManus, and Maureen Johnson’s “Truly Devious” series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an enjoyable and seasonally fitting murder mystery with a strong thematic message. Despite some issues with the audiobook narration, it’s a solid recommendation for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up."

While it had the same writing style and mystery elements, it wasn’t as good.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - The dual timelines worked really well. One timeline depicted the lives of the family that lived in the mansion in the past, including what really happened with the children. This was my favorite part.  \n  - The second timeline in the present focused on the mystery of the missing doctor, which was intriguing.  \n  - I also enjoyed learning about the history of the 1000 islands, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - The LGBTQ romance felt forced and unnecessary. The book didn’t need a romance element to be compelling.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, it’s a solid YA thriller, and I would recommend it to fans of the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile not as strong as the *Truly Devious* series, this novel delivers an engaging mystery with well-executed dual timelines and interesting historical context.

I found the Ralston family's perspective so compelling that I wished the entire narrative had unfolded within their timeline.

The story begins with Marlowe Wexler unintentionally burning down a house during a disastrous date, prompting her to retreat from the world.

Overall, the premise was engaging, and I appreciated the seamless blend of mystery and personal growth.",

            "The central mystery centers on the deaths of two children shortly after the house's construction, followed by the seemingly natural yet suspicious deaths of the rest of the family. While the initial two deaths raise questions, the subsequent ones appear to be mere misfortunes, complicating any human explanation. However, the resolution effectively ties everything together, delivering satisfying answers. The narrative alternates between the 1930s and the present day, where a group of teens serves as guides in the house, now open to the public for a summer. This structure enhances the depth and tension, particularly during the flashbacks, as readers are aware of the characters' fates.",
            "The tone closely resembles that of *Truly Devious*, featuring mysterious family conspiracies and a seemingly cursed lineage. Those who appreciated *Truly Devious* are likely to enjoy this story too.",
            "The Morning House is captivating—a two-story playhouse constructed by a wealthy doctor who had a passion for swimming. Its unsettling history of mysterious deaths and the family's tragic background make it a location I would love to explore if it were real. The chilling flashbacks to the 1930s, narrated from the children's perspectives before their untimely deaths, enhance the story's eerie atmosphere.",

This well-executed thriller delivered the same level of creepiness and suspense I love in horror novels."

However, it turned out to be a mystery thriller, similar to Maureen Johnson’s *Truly Devious* series. While I personally prefer horror, I still enjoyed this well-executed thriller, which was just as creepy and gripping as a horror novel.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The Morning House itself is fascinating—a two-story playhouse built for the children of a wealthy doctor with an obsession with swimming. Its eerie history of mysterious deaths and the family’s tragic past make it a place I’d want to visit if it were real. The flashbacks to the 1930s, told from the perspectives of the children before their deaths, added a chilling layer to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The core mystery revolves around the deaths of two children shortly after the house was built, followed by the seemingly natural but suspicious deaths of the rest of the family. While the first two deaths felt suspicious, the others appeared to be strokes of bad luck, making it hard to rationalize a human explanation. The resolution ties everything together, though, and the answers are satisfying.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n   - The book alternates between flashbacks to the 1930s and the present day, where the house is open to the public for a summer, with a group of teens living there as guides. This structure adds depth and tension, especially when reading the flashbacks, knowing the characters’ fates.  \n\n- **Tone and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - The tone is very similar to *Truly Devious*, with mysterious family conspiracies and a seemingly cursed family. If you enjoyed *Truly Devious*, you’ll likely enjoy this one as well.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Nostalgia:**  \n   - Reading YA as an adult feels comforting and nostalgic, reminding me of simpler times. Diving into the head of a younger character is always fun and brings back memories of my youth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a well-executed mystery thriller with a fascinating setting, a gripping plot, and a tone reminiscent of Maureen Johnson’s *Truly Devious* series. While it wasn’t the horror novel I initially expected, it delivered a creepy and satisfying story with a nostalgic YA feel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Seeing through her eyes as she entered this new world and met the other characters was engaging and immersive.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Timelines:**  \n   - The mix of present and past timelines was well done. The transitions between timelines felt smooth and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Development:**  \n   - The mysteries were satisfying, and the thought process the characters went through to solve them was believable. However, the driving mystery in the present timeline doesn’t kick off until the 50% mark, which might frustrate some readers.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n   - Johnson’s descriptions were vivid and unique, with a lot of unusual metaphors that stood out. Her humor also resonated with me and added a layer of enjoyment to the reading experience.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing is a double-edged sword. The first half of the book is slow, which didn’t bother me personally, as I enjoyed the character and world-building. However, I can see how many readers might find it directionless and lose interest before the story picks up. From the 50% mark, the pace skyrockets, with each chapter becoming faster than the last.  \n\n- **Reader Suitability:**  \n   - If you enjoy meandering narratives and sinking deeply into a character and their world, this book is worth a try. However, if you dislike slow-moving stories, this one might not be for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book for its engaging character perspective, well-crafted mysteries, and unique writing style. However, the slow pacing in the first half could be a barrier for some readers, making it a divisive read. It’s a book that rewards patience, but not everyone will be willing to wait for the story to fully unfold.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel maintains a steady pace that keeps readers engaged from start to finish. Its dual storyline, featuring two murders across different eras, is both intriguing and well-executed. Clara’s 1920s tragedy is particularly compelling, overshadowing Marlowe’s modern-day narrative, although both are enjoyable. However, Clara's story feels somewhat underdeveloped, lacking depth in the portrayal of her family members and staff. The romantic plot twist involving Marlowe’s candle explosion feels overly emphasized and somewhat unnecessary, even if it does propel the story forward. The setting of the haunted mansion, Morning House, along with the mystery of the mentor's disappearance, adds layers of intrigue and suspense. The alternating perspectives of Marlowe and Clara effectively build tension, especially as Clara’s tragic fate looms. Overall, Clara’s vintage, old-money backdrop, filled with dark family secrets, is more engaging than Marlowe’s teenage drama.",
            "The novel boasts a sizable cast of characters, many of whom come across as unnecessary or underutilized. Clara stands out as a mysterious, likable, and proactive figure, taking on detective-like actions before the murder. In contrast, Marlowe, though less confident than Clara, is relatable and carries the narrative with her appealing personality. However, the relationships in Marlowe's story feel superficial, missing the opportunity to develop a found-family dynamic. Additionally, some characters, particularly in Marlowe's arc, could have been streamlined to create a more intimate and impactful plot.",
            "The novel delves into complex relationships, some of which feel frustrating or underdeveloped. The Ralstone family dynamic is both strange and captivating, drawing readers into the story. Additionally, the contrast between the two murders—one fueled by passion and the other by necessity—adds significant depth to the narrative."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel is a compelling read, particularly for the Ralstone story, which stands out as the more engaging and richly detailed narrative. While Marlowe’s story fits well within the YA thriller genre, it could have benefited from fewer characters and a more intimate, emotionally charged plot. Overall, the dual timelines and complex relationships kept me invested, though I wish the Ralstone story had been given more attention.",

            "Marlowe embodies a passive heroine, largely reacting to events rather than propelling the plot forward herself. It isn’t until much later in the story that she begins to actively engage in solving the mystery, which feels like a missed opportunity. On a positive note, I appreciated her emotional consistency, particularly in her relationship with her girlfriend, as it added depth to her character.",

            "The mystery in this book lacks the depth of the author's previous works; the red herring is easy to spot, and the backstory is revealed early on. However, the dual timelines and narratives are expertly crafted. The past timeline, featuring compelling teenagers and a critique of twisted patriarchy, outshines the present-day plot. The final twist, delivered through a letter at the end, is both heartbreaking and brilliant, although I had stopped actively trying to piece together the mystery by that stage."

It’s about Marlowe, not Stevie. While I was excited for a new story in a similar mystery space, this book didn’t live up to the same standard as the *Truly, Devious* books.  \n\n- **Character Development (Marlowe as a Protagonist):**  \n   - Marlowe is a passive heroine.

She is so endearingly awkward without being cringey or overly in your face about it.\"  \n  - \"As the reader, you know that she's jumping to conclusions and isolating herself, but you just can't help but feel for her with her whole romantic situation.\"  \n  - \"The whole cast of characters at the House is colourful and fun, and I loved that we got basically an all-queer cast.\"  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - \"I truly didn't know the answer to the modern-day whodunnit until the reveal, and that was a really fun part of this for me.\"  \n  - \"My favourite part of this whole book was learning about Morning House. There are so many revelations and interesting tidbits thrown in amongst Marlowe's story.\"  \n  - \"I didn't expect the outcome, and I love surprises, but I also just really liked getting to know the Roulstons (sp?) in the past and figuring out how they lived in the house that Marlowe then finds herself in in the present.\"  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - \"The pacing of this one did feel a little off - I think I'd have felt it more if I didn't inhale it in basically two sittings, but that's the only reason I take a half-star off.\"  \n\n- **Author's Style and Comparison:**  \n  - \"Maureen writes such bangers when it comes to YA mysteries.\"  \n  - \"This is another great mystery from Maureen, and I am so stoked to read more from her like this and Truly Devious.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating YA mystery with a well-crafted narrative that intertwines past and present seamlessly. The engaging audiobook format, endearing characters, and unexpected twists make it a highly enjoyable read. While the pacing felt slightly off, the overall experience was immersive and satisfying, leaving me eager to explore more of the author's work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

            "The misdirection surrounding Max was frustrating. The buildup of Clara's suspicions about him was ultimately abandoned, missing a chance to explore a compelling evil child storyline. While Unity's role as the killer aligns with her father's eugenics beliefs, the Max subplot felt like a fakeout that detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "April's character exuded unsettling vibes, raising questions about why others overlooked or ignored her manipulative behavior. The Ralston family's dynamics suggested deeper issues—such as Clara's warning to her siblings to lock their doors—but these threads remained underexplored, resulting in unresolved narrative elements.",

            "The revelation that all the characters were Philip's biological children seemed unnecessary and contributed little to the plot. Additionally, the romantic subplot was unsatisfying; the buildup between Marlowe and Riki ultimately led to Marlowe realizing her feelings for Akilah, a character who had limited presence in the story. This turn felt abrupt and underdeveloped.",
            "In the story, Marlowe's high-energy, bouncy personality can be initially overwhelming and even irritating, particularly from a first-person perspective. However, the author brilliantly crafts unique, fully realized characters, and Marlowe stands out as distinctly different from their more famous protagonist, Stevie. Her personality, reminiscent of Pinkie Pie, is filled with vibrant thoughts, making her feel authentic even if she isn't always an enjoyable character to accompany.",
            "The first 25% of the book was challenging, but the story improved dramatically with Marlowe's arrival on the island and the introduction of the full cast of characters. The inclusion of flashback chapters added depth and intrigue, making the narrative more engaging. By the halfway point, the book transformed into a page-turner, with the latter half being especially gripping and keeping me on the edge of my seat.",
            "The mystery elements, intricately woven between the past and present, captivated my attention until the very end. The author's writing truly shone in the book's latter half, particularly in standout scenes like Marlowe's harrowing experience with a drug overdose."

        "conclusion": "While the book started off slow and initially felt overwhelming due to Marlowe’s personality, it ultimately grew on me. The latter half was captivating, with excellent writing and a compelling mystery. Despite some questionable plot choices and an underwhelming romantic subplot, I ended up really enjoying the book.

            "This book offers a more balanced narrative with fewer pages dedicated to cold case flashbacks. Marlowe uncovers critical details early on, keeping the story engaging. However, I preferred the family drama set in the past over the modern-day teen elements, which left me slightly disappointed with the focus. Departing from the Truly Devious crew, the story introduces a new cast. Marlowe, a junior from upstate New York, inadvertently burns her house down during a date and finds herself working at a historic summer home turned museum in the Thousand Islands. The museum carries a dark history, including the deaths of two children in the 1930s and a recent death tied to Marlowe’s coworkers. The unique setting successfully blends historical mystery with contemporary drama.",
            "The new cast is refreshingly diverse and notably more likable than the Truly Devious crew. Marlowe stands out as a relatable protagonist, complemented by a rich supporting cast that features an Indian goth girl as a romantic interest and a grieving gay pothead, enhancing both depth and representation.",
            "The author skillfully weaves in comic relief, even amidst the tension of murder mysteries."

        "conclusion": "This book is a solid addition to the author’s repertoire, offering a unique blend of YA cold case mystery and modern-day drama set in a fascinating location. While I missed the deeper historical flashbacks from previous works, the diverse cast, balanced pacing, and humor made it an enjoyable read. If you’re a fan of YA mysteries with a touch of history and a diverse cast, this is worth picking up.",

The narrative skillfully intertwines Marlowe's contemporary experiences with the historical mystery surrounding Morning House, creating a captivating dual storyline.",

Unlike Stevie Bell, who is driven by an obsession to solve puzzles, Marlowe’s inquisitiveness makes her a compelling character. The supporting cast of teen tour guides further enriches the narrative, each grappling with their own issues and dynamics that Marlowe skillfully navigates.",

I’m now eager to read as many historical/modern mysteries as Maureen Johnson writes.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story revolves around Marlowe Wexler, a new protagonist, who accidentally sets fire to a house during her first date with the girl of her dreams. To escape the fallout, she takes a summer job as a tour guide at Morning House, an island estate with a tragic history. The plot intertwines Marlowe’s present-day experiences with the historical mystery of what truly happened at Morning House, creating a compelling dual narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Marlowe is a relatable and engaging main character. She’s mortified by her mistakes but also curious and willing to follow the mystery where it leads. Unlike Stevie Bell, she doesn’t have an obsessive drive to solve mysteries, but her natural curiosity makes her a great protagonist. The supporting cast of teen tour guides adds depth, with their own issues and dynamics that Marlowe navigates.  \n\n- **Historical vs. Modern Mystery:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of Maureen Johnson’s writing is how she contrasts the historical truth with the modern characters’ interpretations. The historical segments gradually reveal the tragic events at Morning House, while the modern characters piece together a fragmented version of the past. This approach highlights how the full picture of history is often elusive, even if the broad strokes can be discerned.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This standalone mystery was fantastic, and I found myself wishing I could spend more time with Marlowe and her friends. I’m excited to read any future mysteries Maureen Johnson writes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial disappointment, *Death at Morning House* exceeded my expectations. It’s a well-crafted standalone mystery with a compelling protagonist, a dual-timeline narrative, and a thought-provoking exploration of history and truth.

However, the two storylines in *Death at Morning House* don’t intertwine as neatly as they do in *Truly Devious*.  \n   - The protagonist, Marlowe, is not as obsessed with solving the mystery as Stevie Bell is, which makes the mystery less fun to read. Marlowe’s interest in the drama is more self-motivated rather than driven by a passion for solving mysteries.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters are written in Johnson’s typical style—fun, quirky, and very teen-like.  \n   - However, I wish more time had been spent showing the relationships between characters rather than having them explained to Marlowe through dialogue (e.g., who loves whom and why).  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Structure:**  \n   - Both the past and present mysteries are straightforward, with twists that aren’t overly surprising (though this might be subjective, as I read a lot of thrillers).  \n   - Despite the lack of major twists, the mysteries are still satisfying.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - Johnson seems to be commenting on eugenics through the past storyline, which is a fascinating choice. However, she doesn’t fully explore or drive the message home.  \n   - There was potential for the modern teens to discuss these themes more explicitly, but the narrative only implies rather than confronts the issues directly.  \n\n- **Protagonist’s Perspective and Relatability:**  \n   - Marlowe is a believable teen, and her lack of obsession with the mystery is relatable. However, this also makes her less engaging as a protagonist compared to Stevie Bell.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n   - The book includes themes of death (including teen death in the past), eugenics, racial purity discussions, and wild dieting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is an interesting novel with familiar elements from Johnson’s previous work, but it doesn’t quite reach the same level of intrigue or depth.

            "The author skillfully crafts intricate mysteries, and this novel is no exception. The pacing kept me fully engaged and introduced a momentary twist that made me question my initial suspicions about the culprit. The story follows Marlowe Wexler, whose summer plans are upended by a candle explosion at the lake home she’s caretaking. She takes on the role of tour guide at a famous house on an island in the Hudson River, the site of a tragedy in the 1930s. The narrative seamlessly intertwines present-day mysteries—a disappearance and an accident—with the historical one from 1932, which was similarly regarded as a tragic incident. While I successfully identified the perpetrator of the present-day events, the 1932 mystery revealed itself to be more intricate, culminating in a satisfying yet disturbing conclusion.",
            "The characters are well-developed and captivating. Marlowe stands out as quietly observant, awkward, and empathetic, boasting a photographic memory and a big heart. Riki, a seemingly prickly goth-girl, adds depth, while Van's exuberance and April's bubbly nature create a vibrant dynamic. The 1930s characters are equally intriguing; I would have loved to explore their tragic stories further, despite the darkness that lingers around them.",

I immediately connected with her and found myself rooting for her throughout the story. While the supporting characters were enjoyable, they didn't quite charm me like the *Truly, Devious* cast. Ricki and Van received the most development, but Liani, Tom, and April felt underutilized. In particular, Tom was so sidelined that I occasionally forgot about him.

I even received an ARC of this title, though I delayed reading it for too long.  \n  - This is Johnson's first non-*Truly, Devious* book in several years, and while it doesn't feature Stevie and her friends, it still delivers a mystery that will appeal to fans of that series.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The story follows Marlow Wexler, who, after a disastrous date, ends up working at Morning House for the summer. The house has a dark history, with two terrible deaths in the 1930s and a curse that has haunted the family for generations. Marlow, however, is more focused on surviving her summer job without further messing up her life.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Marlow is a fantastic protagonist with her own distinct voice. She embodies Maureen Johnson's signature humor and awkwardness without feeling like a copy of Stevie from *Truly, Devious*. I loved her immediately and rooted for her throughout the story.  \n  - The supporting characters, while fun, didn't charm me as much as the *Truly, Devious* crew. Ricki and Van received the most development, while Liani, Tom, and April felt underutilized. Tom, in particular, was so sidelined that I forgot about him at times. I wish all the characters had been fleshed out more.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  - The dual timeline, with chapters set in the past, was executed exceptionally well. I was always eager to return to the historical perspective, as the Ralston family's bizarre and tragic life was utterly captivating.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - This book was super fun and another big win from Maureen Johnson. It’s perfect for fans of Holly Jackson and Karen M. McManus.  \n  - If you haven’t read *Truly, Devious* yet, I highly recommend starting it right away!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is a delightful mystery that showcases Maureen Johnson's talent for crafting engaging characters and intriguing plots. While the supporting cast could have been more developed, Marlow’s story and the dual timeline make this a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The dual-time-period structure is expertly crafted, featuring a murderer in each era. While I failed to solve one of the murders, I came close with the other, and the true motive and resolution were far more captivating than my theories. The pacing is just right, providing enough detail to maintain interest without making the outcome too predictable.",
            "*Nine Liars* suffers from an overwhelming number of characters, which detracts from the central murder mystery and introduces distracting subplots. In contrast, *Death at Morning House* features a leaner cast, allowing readers to connect more deeply with each character and unravel the murderer’s identity across different time periods. The characters are not only engaging and humorous, but their unique backstories add depth without falling into the realm of cliché quirks, a quality I truly appreciate in YA literature.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Consistency and Growth:**  \n   - I have been a fan of Johnson since the *Truly Devious* series, but felt the series and the murders got away from her a bit in the last book, *Nine Liars*.  \n   - *Death at Morning House* marks a return to form, with Johnson back on firmer ground, deftly weaving her witty murderous magic between two time periods.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n   - *Nine Liars* had too many characters, making it hard to keep track and overshadowing the murder with uninteresting storylines.  \n   - In *Death at Morning House*, there are fewer characters, making it easier to get to know them and figure out the murderer in each time period.  \n   - The characters are funny and interesting, with backstories that are not typical (though not dismissively \"quirky\"), which I love in Johnson's YA books.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Engagement:**  \n   - The dual-time-period structure is executed brilliantly, with a murderer in each era.  \n   - I didn’t solve one murder but got close with the other, and the actual motive and resolution were far more interesting than my guesses.  \n   - The pacing kept me engaged, with enough information to stay interested but not so much that the outcome became obvious.  \n\n- **Research and Detail Integration:**  \n   - One critique is the lack of sufficient research integration. A current-day character is researching a family tragedy from 100 years earlier, but I wanted more engagement with her discoveries to help the main character figure things out organically.  \n   - This could have added depth and made the story more cohesive, even if it slowed the pacing slightly.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Writing Quality:**  \n   - Despite the critique, this was a great read, well-written, and the perfect way to close out the year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death at Morning House* is a strong return to form for Johnson, with engaging characters, a clever dual-time-period plot, and her signature wit.

            "The story unfolds in the present day through the first-person perspective of Marlowe Wexler, allowing readers to gain insight into her character. However, I struggled to form a connection with her. For much of the book, Marlowe remains passive, only asserting herself towards the end, which I found frustrating. She hesitates to fully step into her detective role, only piecing clues together when danger arises. I wished she had played a more active part in unraveling the historical mystery.\n\nThe secondary characters in the present-day storyline felt underdeveloped, making it easy to confuse them. Even Marlowe’s love interest, Riki, came across as one-dimensional, which hindered my ability to connect with them or care about the present-day conflicts. In contrast, the historical segments, presented from multiple perspectives, captivated me far more. I found myself more invested in these characters and their experiences than in Marlowe’s narrative. While the historical mystery unfolded predictably, I enjoyed it significantly more than the contemporary plot.",
            "The author’s writing is exceptional, showcasing her skill in crafting a compelling mystery. Her vivid descriptions of Morning House and the island created an immersive experience that made me feel present in the story. However, the pacing was uneven, with the plot lagging until the final 20%, when it finally gained momentum.",
            "The mysteries were intricately woven, with clever clues seamlessly embedded in the narrative. While there were a few unexpected twists, I had hoped for a stronger connection between the present and past mysteries. The resolution of the historical mystery was somewhat disappointing, as it remained unsolved, and the big reveal ultimately fell flat."

While the present-day narrative and characters lacked depth, the historical timeline and the author’s skillful writing made it an enjoyable read.

The pacing is uneven; the beginning feels slow, but the latter half is fast-paced and truly engaging.

            "The book starts off slowly but gains momentum around the 60% mark. It employs a dual timeline, shifting between the present day and July 1932. Central to the story is a house steeped in tragedy: on July 27, 1932, two children tragically died—one by drowning and the other from a fall—prompting their family to leave the next day. Since then, the house has stood empty. In the present, the renovated house opens for summer tours before being reserved for private use. The narrative is rich with mysteries that require close attention to clues. I found one reveal particularly surprising, while I managed to anticipate a few others just before they were unveiled.",

Five are locals, while the sixth, an outsider, is brought in to fill a vacant spot, introducing a mystery that unfolds throughout the narrative. I particularly enjoyed the realistic portrayal of friendship; although some relationships were imperfect, the characters' ability to collaborate despite initial mistrust added depth to their interactions.",

I was surprised by one of the reveals and barely figured out the others just before they were disclosed.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The story features six teenagers working at the house for the summer, each with specific roles: three in charge of tours, one lifeguard, one managing water equipment, and one running the gift shop.  \n   - Five of the teenagers are locals, while the sixth is from out of town and was brought in to fill an empty spot. The reason for her inclusion is a mystery that unfolds in the story.  \n   - I really enjoyed the portrayal of friendship in the book. While some of the friendships weren’t perfect, they felt realistic. I appreciated how the characters worked together despite initial mistrust.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The house itself, with its tragic past and eerie atmosphere, plays a central role in the story. The dual timeline adds depth to the setting, connecting the past and present.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Death at Morning House* is an engaging mystery with a well-crafted dual timeline and multiple layers of intrigue. While the pacing was slow at first, the story gained momentum and kept me hooked. The friendships and dynamics among the characters added a relatable and heartfelt element to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Standalone vs. Series Potential:**\n   - I appreciate that this is a standalone mystery and hope it remains that way. Marlowe, the protagonist, is not a professional detective like Stevie Bell from Johnson's Truly Devious series. She’s an everyday chaotic lesbian who stumbles into a mystery, which feels authentic and refreshing. Turning this into a series would feel out of character for Marlowe, as she doesn’t actively seek out mysteries.\n\n- **Mystery Complexity:**\n   - The whodunnit aspects were fairly easy to figure out, especially for someone who reads a lot of mysteries. It’s not a story that will stump you for long. However, this simplicity aligns with the premise of an everyday person being thrust into a mystery. It’s more akin to Agatha Christie’s standalone works rather than her more intricate Poirot or Marple novels.\n\n- **Characterization and Representation:**\n   - I enjoyed the quirky, modern-day characters, particularly Marlowe. The LGBTQIA representation was well-done and added depth to the story. Marlowe’s relatability as an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events made her a compelling protagonist.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The descriptions of 1930s Thousand Island's Millionaire Row were vivid and almost cinematic, adding a rich layer to the story. However, I was surprised that the Great Depression wasn’t mentioned more, especially in discussions about the modern-day characters, given its significant impact on the world at the time.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - This was a fun, quick read. It’s perfect for an afternoon when you want an easy-to-figure-out mystery with engaging characters and a unique setting. While it may not challenge seasoned mystery readers, it’s an enjoyable and lighthearted story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis standalone mystery is a delightful, quick read with quirky characters, strong LGBTQIA representation, and a vivid historical setting. While the mystery itself isn’t overly complex, it’s well-suited to the premise of an everyday person stumbling into a crime.

            "This novel presents a captivating dual-timeline murder mystery set in Morning House, alternating between 1932 and the present day. The interplay between the two timelines enhances the story's depth and intrigue. Marlowe's quest to uncover clues surrounding the deaths keeps the mystery engaging. However, the resolution feels rushed, with crucial details being explained rather than uncovered through the investigation, slightly diminishing the overall experience.",

Her guilt over accidentally setting her house on fire adds depth to her character, making her determination to uncover the truth behind the deaths at Morning House all the more compelling. The supporting cast is quirky and memorable, featuring distinct personalities that enhance the story. Riki, the goth girl from a local bookshop, is a standout favorite, while characters like Van, Liana, April, and Tom further enrich the narrative.",

My journey with Maureen started with the *Truly Devious* series, and I fell in love with her writing and the quirkiness of her characters. When you love a series so much, it can be hard not to expect the same reaction with a new book by the same author. *Death at Morning House* did not disappoint with its twists and turns, but I had to adjust my expectations about how the stories would intertwine.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Twists:**  \n  The book features multiple stories, each with its own problem to solve.

While the solution was intriguing, it leaned slightly towards predictability. The author's use of a dual narrative was effective and offered a fresh perspective compared to her earlier works.",
            "I loved the book, but I felt that the main character, Marlowe, lacked the agency and determination necessary to justify her role as the sole narrator. While Marlowe isn't a thorough detective, the gradual revelation of past secrets at the end somewhat compensates for this. As a first-person narrator, she shines, and the prose is effervescent and enjoyable. The characters in both timelines are engaging, though there are quite a few of them. While it takes some effort to keep track early on, it becomes easier to differentiate them as the story unfolds. The characters are funny, endearing, and flawed, adding depth to the narrative.",

            "This novel skillfully weaves two parallel timelines: one set in the 1930s and the other in the present day, both centered around murders. The 1930s storyline is reminiscent of Agatha Christie's *Crooked House*, yet it deftly sidesteps the harmful neurodivergent stereotypes found in the original. The exploration of eugenics is both intriguing and thoughtfully presented, with a historically accurate reference to GK Chesterton, who denounced eugenics during that era. Overall, the narrative is engaging and socially aware, offering a fresh perspective on its themes.",

By sidestepping the common Snark Monster trope that often flattens YA protagonists, Marlowe emerges as a refreshing and well-developed character."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the novel is an enjoyable read, particularly due to its strong protagonist, Marlowe, and the well-executed 1930s mystery with its eugenics theme.

She is wry and humorous while remaining believably wide-eyed and earnest, capturing the essence of a real teenager.  \n   - She avoids the \"Snark Monster\" trope that often homogenizes many YA protagonists, making her a refreshing and well-crafted character.  \n\n- **Mystery Plot and Structure:**  \n   - The novel features two parallel timelines: a murder in the 1930s and a murder in the present day.  \n   - The 1930s murder draws heavily from Agatha Christie's *Crooked House*, but it avoids the harmful neurodivergent stereotyping present in the original.  \n   - The eugenics theme is intriguing and well-handled, with a historically accurate nod to GK Chesterton, who spoke out against eugenics in the 1930s.  \n\n- **Present-Day Mystery Critique:**  \n   - The present-day mystery was disappointing because it wasn’t connected to the 1930s murder, despite the victim having researched the old murders and the eugenics movement.  \n   - The lack of connection felt like a missed opportunity, especially since it could have added depth and political intrigue to the story.  \n\n- **Teenage Murder Culprits:**  \n   - The portrayal of teenage murder culprits who successfully baffle the police with premeditated murder felt unrealistic and overused.  \n   - The reviewer expresses frustration with this trope, noting that getting away with murder should be portrayed as difficult, not easily achievable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is an enjoyable read, particularly due to its strong protagonist, Marlowe, and the well-executed 1930s mystery with its eugenics theme.

            "The culprits would need to be supergeniuses with extraordinary luck to orchestrate their plans without detection. While the Ralstons were likely actual geniuses, the modern-day murderer doesn't convey the same \"supergenius\" quality.

There’s usually a family member and inheritance involved in these types of stories.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - The setting is cool and unique, and it inspired me to imagine building a retro-style mansion with giant rooms dedicated to my interests. For example:  \n     - A floor-to-ceiling library with a fireplace, maps, comfy chairs, and reading nooks.  \n     - A solarium with exotic plants, fountains, and bonsai trees.  \n     - An arts and crafts studio with all the art supplies ever.  \n     - A workshop with tools for tinkering and chemicals for experimenting.  \n     - A study with a giant desk, comfy rugs, and space for writing, puzzles, and listening to records.  \n     - An observatory for star-gazing.  \n     - Massive grounds for hiking, building tree-houses, scavenger hunts, and cataloging flora and fauna.  \n   - Of course, I’d need a large staff to maintain it, but since I’m imagining myself as enormously wealthy, that’s no concern.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a strong recommendation for fans of YA thrillers.

Built during Prohibition, the house has a dark history, marked by the deaths of two Ralston children and a local resident named Chris.

Although Marlowe's outsider status and her efforts to navigate her new environment are intriguing, she lacks the depth and keen detective skills that made Stevie so captivating.

It seems I am deep in the LGBT umbrella for book reading, and I’m super good with that.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Marlowe is a likable and realistic-feeling girl. Her inner monologue was very relatable because, honestly, girls make me nervous too—they’re so pretty. She’s also prone to jumping to conclusions, which again, is relatable.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book covers some darkness, including family trauma and murder, but in a very easy and light, digestible way. It’s a great balance of serious themes with an approachable tone.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is solid the whole way through. I found myself excited to read each night to see what was uncovered, how Marlowe was going to become friends with the group (or maybe more?), and how she would face her past decisions (and accidents).  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story is set in an island mansion house, previously owned by a family who suffered a great and well-known tragedy. The early summer vibe matched perfectly with the timing of my reading, which added to the immersive experience.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The conclusion was very satisfying and stayed true to the story, especially for a bunch of teens. It wrapped up nicely and felt authentic to the characters and their journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Death at Morning House* was an enjoyable read with great vibes, relatable characters, and a well-paced plot. It balanced darker themes with a light, digestible tone, making it a book I would have loved as a 13-year-old and still appreciate as a 33-year-old.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 ⭐️"

            "As a standalone novel, it effectively delivers an engaging experience, albeit with some red herrings and side stories that feel tangential to the main plot. These minor issues don't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment. The book skillfully weaves a spooky and intriguing mystery across two timelines: the first in 1932, featuring a eugenics believer, his adopted children, and a series of tragic deaths; the second following Marlowe, a contemporary tour guide at Morning House. The mysteries unfold compellingly in both timelines, resulting in a gripping narrative.",
            "The characters, especially the eugenics-driven man and his adopted children, are deeply engaging. The family's strict schedules, diets, and the tragic events that unfold add significant depth and darkness to the story. The inclusion of a wife and their child, along with the ensuing tragedies, further enhances the narrative.",
            "The Thousand Islands and St. Lawrence River setting is rich and atmospheric, yet I was surprised not to find an author’s note clarifying the choice of locations, particularly Boldt Castle on Heart Island. The castle's history—including its opulence, the unfinished construction following the owner's wife's death, and subsequent vandalism—adds a compelling layer to the narrative. Additionally, the inclusion of Prohibition-era rum runners and other historical elements further enriches the story’s ambiance."

I was surprised there wasn’t an author’s note explaining her choice of setting, especially regarding Boldt Castle on Heart Island. The history of the castle—its opulence, the unfinished construction after the owner’s wife died, and the vandalism by kids—adds a fascinating layer to the story. The Prohibition-era rum runners and other historical elements further enhance the ambiance.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The novel weaves a spooky and intriguing mystery. It intertwines two timelines: one in 1932 involving a man who believes in eugenics, his adopted children, and a series of tragic deaths, and a contemporary story about Marlowe, who becomes a tour guide at Morning House. The mysteries compound in both timelines, creating a gripping narrative.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Themes:**  \n  The characters, particularly the man who believes in eugenics and his adopted children, are compelling. The strict schedules, diets, and the tragic events surrounding the family add depth and darkness to the story.

The mystery of the past was particularly compelling; I genuinely didn't anticipate the murderer’s identity until the reveal. While I wasn't disappointed by the ending—it was satisfactory—I did feel a tinge of disappointment because I had speculated a different conclusion that I believed would have provided a fantastic twist. Many elements I perceived as red herrings turned out to be genuine clues, suggesting I should have interpreted everything at face value.

The past-mystery was particularly strong and held together well—I genuinely didn’t know who committed the murder until it was revealed.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  I wasn’t exactly disappointed in the ending—it was fine!

I was particularly struck by the parallels between the current group of tour guides at Morning House and the original family who lived there, as well as the two concurrent mysteries unfolding.

The format skillfully links the mystery of the Ralston family curse with Marlow's experiences on Ralston Island.

The character dynamics enrich the narrative, yet the Professor's hands-off approach allows the teens to navigate their challenges largely on their own.",

However, her voice lacks consistency; while her irreverent tone is delightful, it occasionally shifts to a more poetic style, which can be jarring.

Although I found him detestable, he was brilliantly written and fit seamlessly into the narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Mystery:**  \n  - This is the first story I’ve read where I found myself trying to figure out a death, which was intriguing. The title itself hints at this, so it doesn’t feel like a spoiler.  \n  - The book doesn’t leave any unsolved mysteries, which I appreciated. Everything is explained coherently by the end, unlike some other books I’ve read that left me frustrated.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - The author has an amazing sense of humor, which made the book enjoyable and prevented it from causing me anxiety.  \n  - There are dark hints in the descriptions, particularly when detailing the design of the house, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  - The story revolves around a teenager named Marlowe, who likes a girl named Akilah and invites her to a house she’s been taking care of. Everything ends up on fire, which becomes a major talking point in their town.  \n  - Marlowe is later invited to work at Morning House, a place with a mysterious history dating back to the 1930s. This seems like an opportunity for her to escape the jokes and scrutiny surrounding the fire.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Author Appreciation:**  \n  - I discovered that the author, Maureen, has collaborated with one of my favorite authors, which made me even more excited to read her work. She’s now part of my TBR (to-be-read) list for future readings.  \n\n- **Timing and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - This book came at the perfect time for me, as I had just finished a book that felt like a waste of time and left me upset. This story was a refreshing change.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read with a perfect blend of humor, mystery, and dark undertones. The plot was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the story tied up all loose ends, leaving no frustrating gaps. Discovering the author’s connection to one of my favorite writers was an added bonus, and I’m excited to explore more of her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on an accidental arsonist who takes a job giving tours at an abandoned 1930s mansion filled with unsolved mysteries. The premise is intriguing, and I was especially captivated by the connections to the mansion's 1930s characters.",
            "The contemporary characters lacked depth, and I only felt a connection with two of them. In contrast, I was drawn to the characters from the 1930s, as their story felt more compelling and intricately linked to the central mystery.",

I’d love to see more of this location in future works.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Fans of *Truly, Devious* will likely enjoy this book, though it didn’t quite reach the same level of engagement for me.  \n  - I’d love to see a potential crossover with Stevie Bell or a follow-up book in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at Morning House* didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of character development, it still delivered an intriguing mystery and a captivating setting.

I found this past timeline more engaging, reminiscent of the family dynamics in *The Umbrella Academy* (minus the superpowers). The present timeline, which follows Marlowe's experiences as a tour guide, starts slowly but builds to an exciting second half. While the mystery is decent, it feels somewhat predictable due to the closed-door nature of the story, which limits the number of suspects. Although the buildup is intriguing, the resolution ultimately lacks surprise.",

            "The book unfolds across two alternating timelines: the present day and the 1930s mystery surrounding the deaths of the Ralston children. While the narrative features multiple perspectives from the past, it is solely focused on Marlowe in the present. I appreciated the structure, but I found myself more drawn to the past timelines and viewpoints than to the contemporary storyline.",

Her odd and inconsistent narration often blurred the timeline, making it feel as though the story had already concluded while simultaneously unfolding in real time. This “breaking the fourth wall” technique felt unnecessary and distracted me from the narrative. In contrast, I found Clara and the Ralston children from the past timeline much more engaging. The present-day characters felt lackluster, and I didn't find any of them particularly likable.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n   - I first started reading books by Maureen Johnson with her *Truly Devious* series, which I absolutely loved. The original trilogy had me in a trance, and the third book was one of my favorite reads in 2020.  \n   - *The Box in the Woods* and *Nine Liars* were enjoyable but not as great as the original trilogy.  \n   - I was hoping *Death at Morning House* would be the next book in the *Truly Devious* series, but it’s a completely separate story. While that’s okay, the story itself had its ups and downs.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and POVs:**  \n   - The book is told in two alternating timelines: present day and the 1930s mystery of the Ralston children’s deaths.  \n   - There are multiple POVs from the 1930s but only Marlowe’s in the present.  \n   - I enjoyed the back-and-forth structure (similar to the *Truly Devious* series), but I found myself preferring the past POVs and timelines over the present ones.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n   - I didn’t connect much with Marlowe, the present-day protagonist. She felt odd and inconsistent, often narrating as if the story had already happened while also speaking as if it were unfolding in real time. This “breaking the fourth wall” approach was unnecessary and took me out of the story.  \n   - I preferred Clara and the Ralston children from the past timeline.  \n   - The present-day characters felt lackluster, and I didn’t truly like any of them.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Resolution:**  \n   - The mystery of the Ralston children’s deaths in the 1930s was satisfying and well-wrapped up, without feeling too neat.  \n   - The present-day mystery, however, felt messy and too easy. The resolution didn’t sit well with me and felt off.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The mystery was fun, and I enjoyed the past timeline more than the present.  \n   - It’s a good read but not something that will blow your mind.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at Morning House* had its strengths, particularly in the 1930s timeline and mystery, the present-day narrative and characters fell short for me. The book is enjoyable but doesn’t reach the heights of Maureen Johnson’s *Truly Devious* series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars, rounded up for social platforms."

            "I typically find dual timeline narratives challenging, especially when the time periods are starkly different. However, the brief chapters set in the 1930s were intriguing and added value without overshadowing the main storyline. The climax of the 1930s plot was particularly well executed; it kept me engaged and guessing without straying into implausibility. I thoroughly enjoyed the locked room interrogation scene where Marlowe unravels the mystery—it was both entertaining and gripping. However, I found the resolution of the main story somewhat disappointing, as I struggled to grasp the villain's motivations fully.",

            "In this captivating novel, Marlowe moves into a mansion-turned-museum that once belonged to the enigmatic Ralston family, following a mishap during a date with her crush, Akilah. As a newly appointed tour guide, Marlowe becomes embroiled in a mystery when her mentor is found dead, unraveling secrets about the Ralston family. The murders are skillfully depicted, with clues meticulously woven throughout the narrative. The dual timeline—set in the 1920s and present day—is expertly executed, allowing the historical mystery and contemporary murder to intertwine seamlessly. While the ending may not fully satisfy, it doesn’t diminish the story's overall brilliance. The mystery is masterfully crafted, with gradual reveals that maintain engagement, and the pacing is well-balanced, allowing tension to build steadily. The final twist involving a letter that clarifies the Ralston family’s fate adds an extra layer of intrigue to this compelling tale.",
            "Marlowe’s relationships, especially with Akilah and Riki, are central to the story. Although I initially wished for a different romantic pairing, the friendships and dynamics within the group are well crafted. The close-knit, queer-friendly group of teenagers living at the mansion feels authentic and refreshing. I appreciate the effortless representation of queerness, as it refrains from making their identities a source of drama, presenting them instead as simply normal teenagers.",
            "The author’s writing is exceptional, skillfully crafting immersive and atmospheric settings. The humor and banter among the characters provide a refreshing contrast to the darker themes of the story. Vivid descriptions, such as the “dancing rainbows” from the prisms, significantly enrich the sensory experience of the novel."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Death at Morning House* is a captivating mystery novel with well-developed characters, a richly atmospheric setting, and a tightly woven plot. While the ending fell slightly short of expectations, the rest of the book is so engrossing that it’s easy to overlook. The author’s writing shines, and the story’s queerness is handled with a refreshing normalcy. I highly recommend this book and hope it becomes the start of something new.",

            "I appreciated that the story featured two mysteries instead of just one, as I figured out the present-day mystery about halfway through. Had that been the sole focus, I would have been disappointed. However, I wasn't a fan of the 1930s past mystery; I thought we had agreed after the first *Truly Devious* book to avoid that era. While I generally dislike \"then and now\" timelines, I found myself warming to it by the end, realizing its necessity to the plot. Initially, it felt like a distraction. I correctly guessed the present-day mystery, which was disheartening, though there was a brief moment when I thought I might be wrong, only to confirm my suspicion. In contrast, the past mystery surprised me, likely because I wasn't actively trying to solve it and struggled to keep the characters straight. However, when the motive was finally revealed, I found it incredibly disappointing; I couldn't believe that was the payoff for all the chapters I had endured.",
            "Initially, I found the main character to be quite unhinged, exhibiting an intense obsession with another girl. The situation escalates dramatically when she burns down a house, leading her to Morning House—a lot to take in all at once.",
            "This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I felt similarly about *Nine Liars*, which leaves me wondering what has shifted. I hope the author returns to the engaging style of the first four *Truly Devious* books."

I noticed that with *Nine Liars*, I didn’t enjoy it as much either, so I’m not sure what’s going on. I hope we get back to whatever the author was doing with the first four *Truly Devious* books.  \n\n- **Main Character (MC):**  \n  My first impression of the MC was that she was insane—like, obsessed with this girl to an intense degree. Then she burns a house down and has to go to Morning House, which was a lot to process.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Mysteries:**  \n  I’m glad there were two mysteries instead of one because I guessed the present-day one about halfway through, and I would have been sad if that was all. However, I wasn’t a fan of the past mystery taking place in the 1930s. I thought after the first *Truly Devious* book, we agreed to never do that again. 😔 I also generally don’t like books with a “then and now” timeline, though it started growing on me by the end when I realized it was necessary to the story. At first, it felt like a waste of time.  \n\n- **Mystery Solving and Predictability:**  \n  I guessed the present-day mystery correctly, which made me sad. There was one split second where I thought I guessed wrong, and I was shocked, but then I realized I didn’t. The past mystery, however, was shocking to me—probably because I wasn’t trying to guess and couldn’t keep the characters straight. But when the motive behind the past mystery was revealed, it was incredibly boring. I couldn’t believe that was what I struggled through all those past chapters for.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Disappointment:**  \n  In the end, I’m very disappointed. I really just wish we got another *Truly Devious* book. 💔  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, it didn’t live up to my expectations.

The current mystery was also skillfully unraveled, and the final reveal effectively tied all the threads together, making for a satisfying conclusion.",

Liana was sweet and dedicated, committed to keeping everyone safe and preserving group harmony. Tom, the serious and business-minded character, added unexpected humor with his intense handshakes and straightforward demeanor.",

I stayed up all night to finish it because the plot was compelling and addictive.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  I found this book a little more predictable than the *Truly Devious* books, possibly because I’ve read more mysteries since then.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  I preferred the chapters set in the past, but the modern-day chapters eventually picked up for me as well.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were just okay. I thought Marlowe’s humor was great, and I really liked Van. Riki grew on me over time, though I didn’t like her at first. The rest of the characters didn’t leave much of an impression on me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I’m happy to have read this book, and it has motivated me to finally pick up *Box in the Woods* and *Nine Liars*, which I’ve put off for too long.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t immediately captivate me like the *Truly Devious* series, it became a compelling and addictive read once I got into it. The plot was engaging, though somewhat predictable, and the characters were a mixed bag, with some standing out more than others. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience that has reignited my interest in the author’s other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75 stars"

Fast forward to the present, the house opens to the public for a summer, and Marlowe, along with a group of teens grappling with their own tragedies, is selected to work there. When another death occurs on the island, the tension escalates, creating a suspenseful atmosphere. Initially, I was hesitant due to the book's opening romantic encounter between two girls, a theme I don't usually enjoy.

Her sapphic thoughts were funny and relatable.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - The book was entirely unputdownable, and I couldn’t recommend it enough.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Death At Morning House* by Maureen Johnson is a fast-paced, atmospheric mystery with a brilliantly executed dual timeline structure.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Similarity to Author's Previous Works:**  \n  Readers of Maureen Johnson's earlier books will find this novel very similar to her earlier works.  \n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The story is set on an island in the Thousand Island region of Upstate New York, where teenagers work as tour guides of a mansion during their summer job.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book employs an alternating timeline, following an eccentric doctor (who is a fan of eugenics) with six adopted teenagers and a young son.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  Early in the story, we learn that the young son and one of the daughters died at the house. The Morning House remains the central focus throughout the alternating timelines.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The action in the book takes a while to pick up, as it features a slow build.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an Advanced Reader Copy via NetGalley.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Maureen Johnson offers a familiar style for fans of her previous works, with a dual-timeline narrative centered around the mysterious Morning House. While the pacing is slow, the setting and premise provide an intriguing backdrop for the unfolding story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This was definitely better than *Nine Liars*, though still not as good as the original *Truly Devious* trio.  \n  - Some “hello fellow kids” cringe, but wholly lovable characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  - The older mystery was definitely stronger than the contemporary story.  \n  - Ultimately, this is my preferred version of a cozy mystery: old house, cute characters, grisly but not too scary mystery.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  - If there was a message beyond “eugenics and fascism are bad,” I didn’t catch it.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Audience Perspective:**  \n  - I am an adult who reads every YA mystery Johnson puts out, so what do I know?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a solid 3.5, rounded up due to my fondness for Maureen Johnson.

            "In this novel, Marlowe embarks on a last-minute summer job as a docent at a historical mansion with a dark past linked to the deaths of two children in the 1930s. The story intricately intertwines the mystery of her boss's disappearance with eerie present-day occurrences and the tragic events of the past. The plot is both haunting and heartbreaking, making it utterly captivating. I was particularly engaged by the 1930s timeline, where each scene introduced new horrors and prompted me to develop numerous theories about the events. The suspense was skillfully crafted; although I didn't foresee the resolution of past events, I did make some correct guesses about the present-day developments—mostly by chance.",

While the main character had moments of annoyance, the Ralston family’s storyline stood out as a highlight. However, the book falls short of being among Maureen Johnson’s best works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This murder mystery stands out from typical formulaic tales, thanks to the author's signature puzzle box style. The narrative unfolds across two timelines: one set in the past, exploring the tragic fate of a cursed family on a Prohibition-era island, and the other in the present, following Marlowe, a tour guide on the same island. I found the past timeline particularly captivating, as it portrays a slow, dark progression towards inevitable doom, steeped in foreshadowing and a pervasive sense of dread. While the present timeline incorporates a whodunnit element, I found it less engaging than the haunting storyline of the past.",
            "Marlowe, the main character, is quirky and relatable as she navigates the dynamics of her local teenage coworkers without fully integrating into their friend group. Her connection with Riki, the rejected goth, is especially endearing and wonderfully cute. The group's perception of Marlowe becomes clearer toward the end, and I wish this dynamic had been explored further throughout the book.",
            "The author’s writing is engaging, balancing humor and darkness effectively. The pacing is deliberate, particularly in the past timeline, where a palpable sense of dread builds. While the present timeline is intriguing, it lacks the same intensity until the final act.",
            "The novel delves into the complexities of dysfunctional friendships and family dynamics, capturing the bittersweet essence of teenage love. It evokes deep feelings of regret and sentimentality, particularly concerning the tragic fates of characters in the past. Their deaths feel both avoidable and meaningless, amplifying the emotional impact of the story.",
            "This YA novel truly stands out with its blend of quirky humor, dysfunctional relationships, and poignant teenage love. The story is both delightful and heart-wrenching, filled with anxious humor that kept me smiling from start to finish."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I loved this book for its unique blend of quirky humor, dark themes, and layered storytelling. While the present timeline’s mystery didn’t captivate me as much as the past, the emotional depth and clever writing made it a standout read. The regret and sentimentality surrounding the characters’ fates lingered with me long after finishing.",

It combines quirky humor, dysfunctional relationships, and teenage love, which is portrayed as both wonderful and heart-wrenching. The anxious, quirky humor kept me smiling throughout.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The story is a murder mystery, but it’s not a typical \"paint-by-numbers\" one. Written by Maureen Johnson, known for her \"puzzle box\" style, it’s clever and layered.  \n   - The narrative alternates between two timelines: the past, focusing on a cursed family living on a Prohibition-era island, and the present, where the main character, Marlowe, works as a tour guide on the same island.  \n   - The past timeline, detailing the tragic deaths of the family members, was my favorite. It’s not a traditional whodunnit but a slow, dark march toward inevitable doom, filled with foreshadowing and a lingering sense of dread.  \n   - The present timeline features a whodunnit, but I found it less compelling compared to the past storyline.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Marlowe, the main character, is quirky and relatable. She navigates the dynamics of a group of local teenagers she works with, though she doesn’t fully integrate into their friend group.  \n   - Her connection with Riki, the friend reject and local goth, is particularly endearing and \"super stinkin’ cute.\"  \n   - The friend group’s perception of Marlowe becomes more evident toward the end, and I wish this dynamic had been explored more throughout the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The novel explores dysfunctional friendships and family dynamics, as well as the bittersweet nature of teenage love.  \n   - It evokes a strong sense of regret and sentimentality, especially regarding the tragic fates of the characters in the past timeline. Their deaths feel avoidable and meaningless, which adds to the emotional weight.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - Maureen Johnson’s writing is engaging, with a mix of humor and darkness. The pacing is deliberate, especially in the past timeline, where the sense of dread builds effectively.  \n   - The present timeline, while intriguing, doesn’t carry the same intensity until the final act.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book for its unique blend of quirky humor, dark themes, and layered storytelling. While the present timeline’s mystery didn’t captivate me as much as the past, the emotional depth and clever writing made it a standout read.

I'm 6 books in, and though they are all YA crime, it never feels like I'm reading the same book.  \n   - Johnson always manages to twist the story in unexpected ways, leaving me humbled and surprised.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - The story hooked me from the first page and kept me on my toes.  \n   - The back-and-forth narrative was enticing and ensured I never got bored.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were intriguing, and I felt a strong emotional connection, especially with Clara (*RIP Clara 😭*).  \n   - Riki had a bit of spice to her, and the tension between her and Marlowe was palpable from the start.  \n   - However, I didn’t feel the romance between Marlowe and Akilah; it felt cringey and didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The LGBTQ+ representation was a delightful surprise and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - My heart tugged more at this story compared to others, particularly due to Clara’s fate.  \n\n- **Room for Improvement:**  \n   - The book would have been a 5⭐️ read if not for one detail: Riki deserved better.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMaureen Johnson delivers another captivating YA crime novel with *Death at Morning House*. While it wasn’t my favorite in the series, it was still a gripping read with intriguing characters, unexpected twists, and excellent LGBTQ+ representation. Despite a few minor flaws, it’s a must-read for fans of *A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder* and *We Were Liars*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️ (would have been 5⭐️ if Riki had been treated better)."

            "The mystery felt more like a narrative exposition than an engaging puzzle. Unlike the Stevie Bell books, where readers piece clues together, this story relies on revealing events as it unfolds, which made the ending feel underwhelming. While I enjoyed the mystery, I found myself wanting more depth and interaction.",

            "As a big fan of the author's Stevie Bell series, I had high hopes for *Death at Morning House*. While I appreciate the author's knack for crafting mystery thrillers, this particular story felt somewhat lacking."

        "conclusion": "While *Death at Morning House* didn’t fully meet my high expectations, it was still an enjoyable read with a charming cast of characters and an intriguing, albeit less engaging, mystery. It’s a solid choice for fans of YA stories with a mix of romance, quirky characters, and a darker undertone.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I’m a huge fan of Maureen Johnson’s Stevie Bell books, so I had super high expectations for this one. I love the way Maureen writes mystery thrillers, but for some reason, *Death at Morning House* fell a bit flat for me.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I liked how the story started with a brief summary of the dark history of Morning House and the tragedies that plagued the Ralston family. The dual timelines were done well, and I never felt like it was too jarring or took me out of the story when it switched.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters were fun and quirky. I particularly liked Marlowe. She’s a shy, good-hearted character with a photographic memory, which came in handy for connecting pieces of the mystery together.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Development:**  \n  The mystery felt less like a mystery and more like a \"tell us\" type of story. It wasn’t like the Stevie Bell books, where we have to piece the clues together. Instead, we’re shown or told events as the story progresses, which made the ending feel a bit underwhelming. I did like the mystery, but personally, I just wanted more.  \n\n- **Themes and Genre Appeal:**  \n  Overall, it was a cute coming-of-age story with some summer romance and mystery. I think it’ll be great for fans of quirky YA characters with a lot of heart, especially those looking for something with a darker background mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Death at Morning House* didn’t fully meet my high expectations compared to Maureen Johnson’s Stevie Bell series, it was still an enjoyable read with a charming cast of characters and an intriguing, albeit less engaging, mystery. It’s a solid choice for fans of YA stories with a mix of romance, quirky characters, and a darker undertone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I appreciated the back-and-forth timeline, which effectively unraveled both mysteries. However, I was disappointed to find no connection between the two timelines, and the resolution felt underwhelming.

It seemed juvenile and jarring compared to the rest of the book.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**\n   - Once the events at Morning House began, the story became interesting and intense, gripping me completely.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Some characters were incredibly loveable, and I hope to see more of them in future books.\n\n- **Overall Plot and Storyline:**\n   - I really enjoyed the plot and overall storyline, finding it engaging and well-crafted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite a rocky start with a confusing narrative and an out-of-place romance subplot, the book eventually captivated me with its intense and intriguing plot. The clever use of time jumps and the lovable characters made it a worthwhile read, and I look forward to potential future books featuring this character group.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.75/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨"

            "The novel's use of split timelines is a format I usually enjoy, especially in whodunit mysteries. However, I found myself much more drawn to the past timeline centered on the family that owned the mansion than to the present-day mystery. While the current storyline was solid, it felt familiar and lacked originality, making it less engaging than the historical narrative. The balance between the two timelines felt off, as I wished for more exploration of the past, which was far more compelling. Despite this imbalance, the story ultimately provided a satisfying sense of closure by the end.",
            "Marlowe, the protagonist, is a captivating character, and her journey of starting over on the island is engaging. However, the present-day characters feel generic and unremarkable. In contrast, the historical family—especially the six children grappling with the loss of their seventh sibling—was profoundly intriguing. I found myself wishing the entire book had centered on their narrative.",
            "The island setting and the cursed mansion create a rich, atmospheric backdrop that enhances the story. The unique concept of offering tours of the mansion adds an enjoyable twist. Additionally, the exploration of the family's upbringing and the shattering of their perfect image in the past timeline creates a haunting and immersive atmosphere that is truly captivating.",
            "The contemporary mystery felt overly familiar, featuring characters and plot elements I've seen numerous times, which lessened its impact. In contrast, the historical storyline was refreshing and original, brilliantly exploring family dynamics and tragedy.\n"

        "conclusion": "While *Death at Morning House* offers an intriguing premise with its split timelines and atmospheric setting, the present-day mystery fell short of originality and failed to hold my attention as much as the captivating past storyline. The family’s tragic history and the exploration of their fractured dynamics were the highlights of the novel, and I would have preferred a book entirely dedicated to that narrative. Nonetheless, the story works well as a whole and provides a satisfying conclusion.",

The author's knack for betrayal and unexpected twists is evident, as I've noticed similar elements in her other works. The cold case was expertly crafted, keeping me more engaged in the past chapters than in other mysteries I've encountered. The striking contrast between the idyllic family home and the horrific events that unfolded there added an intriguing depth to the story.",

It’s hard to explain how I feel about it.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The reveal was vile and shocking, but I still liked it.  \n   - The betrayal and twists in Maureen Johnson’s books are insane and often vile, which is something I’ve noticed in her other works like the Truly Devious series.  \n   - The cold case was written brilliantly, and I was more invested in the past chapters compared to the Truly Devious series.  \n   - The contrast between the idyllic setting (a paradise-like family home) and the horrible events that occurred there added a fascinating layer to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n   - I couldn’t connect well with any of the characters, and it was hard to trust anyone, unlike in the Truly Devious series where I grew attached to certain characters.  \n   - I didn’t love the main character at first, especially with her obsession over another girl and the house burning incident, though it made sense for the story. I did grow to like her more as the story progressed.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n   - Maureen Johnson’s books have a magical energy, especially in the settings. The juxtaposition of beauty and horror in the family’s paradise-like home made the story even more intriguing.  \n\n- **Ending and Relationships (Spoiler):**  \n   - I feel like the main character should have ended up with the other girl instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mix of weirdness, shock, and intrigue, which seems to be a hallmark of Maureen Johnson’s storytelling.

It took me until I was over 50% into the story before it started to click for me.  \n  - The first half felt like it tried too hard to set up the story, with too many characters and side stories that pulled me out of the narrative.  \n  - Once the action in both storylines picked up, I found it much more engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  - The old timeline, featuring the weird family with the rigid father and regimented lifestyle, was far more interesting to me than the present-day storyline.  \n  - The family in the old timeline, despite being super odd, was much more engaging than any of the present-day characters.  \n  - I couldn’t relate to the present-day characters and didn’t feel invested in their story at all.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Work:**  \n  - Overall, the book was good, but it felt much slower-paced compared to Maureen’s *Truly Devious* series, which I love.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its strengths, particularly in the old timeline and the second half, it struggled with pacing and character relatability in the present-day storyline. It didn’t quite match the fast-paced appeal of the *Truly Devious* series, but it was still an enjoyable read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Set in a historically rich mansion, the story unfolds across two timelines: the Ralston family in the 1930s and Marlowe Wexler in the present day. Morning House, once the site of tragedy—marked by the drowning of young Max and the suicide of Clara—has recently been renovated and opened to tourists. Marlowe's journey centers on uncovering the secrets behind her boss Belinda Henson’s mysterious disappearance. As Marlowe and her friends dig deeper into the mansion's dark past, they unearth revelations about the Ralston family. However, the plot twist lacks the shock and surprise one might expect.",

Marlowe’s new friend, Riki, brings depth to the investigation with her obsession with crime.",

            "The novel utilizes a dual-timeline structure reminiscent of Truly Devious, juxtaposing a historical narrative with a contemporary one. The past timeline centers on the Morning House family, comprising a father, his wife, sister, six adopted children (who are actually his biological offspring from different relationships), and his son, Max. In the present, we follow Marlowe, who takes a job as a tour guide at Morning House and becomes embroiled in the estate's mysteries.\n\nThe first half of the novel unfolds at a slow pace, lacking significant action or character development. However, the story gains momentum in the second half, although Marlowe's role in unraveling the mysteries, especially in the past timeline, remains limited. The initial mystery revolves around the deaths of Max and Clara, uncovered through the historical timeline and revealed via a hidden letter rather than Marlowe's efforts. The second mystery concerns the deaths of Chris and Doctor Henson, which Marlowe assists in solving with a group. It's ultimately revealed that April murdered Chris and later Doctor Henson due to her paranoia.",
            "In this gripping story, a father's obsession with a healthy lifestyle imposes strict dietary and exercise regimens on his family. Among them, Max struggles to gain his siblings' favor, particularly from Unity, who ultimately orchestrates his demise. The protagonist, Marlowe, harbors feelings for Akilah but distances himself after accidentally starting a fire at her house. To escape his embarrassment, he takes a job at the Morning House. Unity emerges as a complex character, having killed both Max and Clara, while her aunt sacrifices herself to prevent further devastation. April, driven by humiliation and fear that Chris's behavior will fracture their friend group, also takes a tragic turn, killing Chris and later Dr. Henson under the misguided belief that he witnessed her crime.",
            "The story is compelling, marked by tragic events and intricate character motivations. Its emotional depth is largely rooted in the past timeline, overshadowing Marlowe's present actions."

Seeking refuge from local judgment and her own inner turmoil, she takes a summer job as a tour guide at Morning House. The narrative alternates between the 1920s and present-day Marlowe, offering context for the unfolding events. However, the pacing is uneven; the buildup to the main plot is sluggish, with only the first and last 50 pages capturing the reader's interest.",

When it is finally revealed, the resolution feels rushed and lacks intrigue, as the culprit is disclosed abruptly within one of the perspectives. The present-day mystery fails to deliver suspense or significant twists, while the past timeline is notably more engaging, despite its limited coverage. The climax is predictable due to conspicuous foreshadowing. However, the fast pacing makes the book easy to read. The dual timelines are well-executed, though I wish the past timeline had received more attention.",

The Ralston kids stood out as more interesting, yet their characters remained underdeveloped due to a lack of diverse perspectives. I found it hard to feel invested in any of them. Additionally, the romance subplots felt unnecessary, particularly one involving a character that appeared for just ten pages.",

            "The novel employs a familiar structure, alternating between present-day events and historical flashbacks. The historical murder mystery is more compelling and well-developed than the contemporary narrative, which often feels like an interruption. This present-day plot serves mainly as a vehicle to unravel the more engaging historical mystery. While the author's skill in crafting intriguing mysteries shines through in the historical segments, the reliance on this flashback structure feels formulaic and restricts the story's overall potential.",
            "The narrator's snappy, sarcastic, and self-deprecating voice is a signature of the author’s style; however, it ultimately lacks depth and fails to engage the reader. Unlike other works that showcase well-developed protagonists and rich supporting characters, the contemporary figures in this novel come across as flat and uninteresting.",
            "The author demonstrates a strong knack for creating relatable teen protagonists; however, their ages sometimes feel contrived to fit the YA genre. Given their writing style, the author shows promise for crafting adult mysteries that delve into more mature themes and characters. While the novel's structure and tone are reminiscent of their earlier works, it also possesses a unique quality that allows it to stand alone."

The narrative could have benefited from being significantly shorter by eliminating repetitive elements, such as the frequent mentions of fire and petrichor.",

The contemporary plot centers on the death of Chris, a fellow tour guide, while the historical narrative explores the tragic deaths of two children at Morning House during that era. The twists in both storylines are surprising and well-executed. Overall, the plot is solid and engaging, with well-structured storytelling that holds my interest. The interplay between Marlowe's present and the historical flashbacks adds significant depth to the mystery.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot Structure and Timelines:**\n   - The use of dual timelines (Marlowe at the house and events from the past) was executed brilliantly and enhanced the overall theme.\n   - The story being told from the future added depth and resonance to the narrative.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Marlowe’s portrayal as a teen lesbian was authentic and enjoyable.\n   - Marlowe’s reliability as a narrator was questioned due to the townspeople’s perception of her as a pyromaniac, which created some confusion and doubt.\n\n- **Themes and Plot Elements:**\n   - The eugenics plot element was well-integrated and felt accurate to the time period, though I initially feared it might be abandoned.\n   - I correctly predicted one of the plot points involving the children, but I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to figure it out so quickly.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The small-town setting felt overly insular, as everyone seemed to recognize Marlowe on sight, which strained believability.\n\n- **Relationships and Romance:**\n   - Marlowe’s relationship with Akilha felt underdeveloped, making it hard to root for them as much as the story intended.\n   - The development between Marlowe and Riki was stronger, which made the ending feel awkward in comparison.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed the novel, particularly its dual timelines and Marlowe’s authentic characterization. However, some aspects, like the underdeveloped romance and the small-town setting, left me with mixed feelings. While I wouldn’t rule out reading it again, I’d need time to reflect on whether it’s worth revisiting.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The plot initially captivated me with its intriguing premise. The first few chapters, leading up to the FMC's arrival at the titular location, were engaging and well-crafted, with her witty dialogue keeping my interest alive. However, the story's pacing was excruciatingly slow, with little action occurring until nearly 70% into the book. Key clues introduced early on resurfaced abruptly in the final 15-20%, resulting in a resolution that felt rushed and unsatisfying. The absence of subtle hints throughout the narrative made it difficult to connect with the mystery or anticipate the ending. While the final revelation was striking, it lacked the buildup necessary for maximum impact. Its suddenness, reminiscent of jarring moments like Augustus Waters’ fate in *The Fault in Our Stars*, detracted from its effectiveness. Despite these pacing issues, the climactic twist ultimately stood out as a commendable aspect of the book.",

I wanted more of those spine-tingling moments where you’re not sure if a ghost is going to jump out or if another tragic accident is about to happen.

            "The plot aimed to be creepy and thrilling but ultimately fell flat, feeling somewhat tedious. The pacing was rushed, particularly in the portrayal of the antagonists and the resolution of the mystery. The teen detective primarily served as a narrator, recounting events rather than eliciting confessions. I'm growing weary of the trend in thrillers where a teen unravels a decades-old mystery. A singular focus on the 1930s, exploring eugenics and its impact on the family, would have been more engaging. While Max's killer was a surprise, the underdeveloped motives weakened the overall effect.",

I found myself more engaged with the house's past and wished for greater emphasis on that aspect. While the contemporary storyline is entertaining, it often pales in comparison to Marlowe’s personal drama. The novel opens with Marlowe attempting a date night at a house she's babysitting, which ends disastrously when a candle explodes, destroying half the place. To escape the fallout, she takes a job at Morning House, known for its dark history of unnatural deaths. The story suggests a cycle of tragedy, as the teenager Marlowe is replacing also suffered a recent accident. The premise is intriguing, yet the execution feels somewhat contrived.",
            "In this stand-alone novel, the characters lack the depth found in some of the author's other works, likely due to their youth and relative immaturity. Marlowe's personal struggles—specifically her heartache over a lost love and a series of misfortunes—dominate the narrative, overshadowing the central mystery."

            "This novel is a compelling mystery that expertly employs the classic trope of an isolated house on an island, enhancing its intrigue. The story centers on Marlowe Wexler, who takes a summer job at Morning House, a site shadowed by the tragic deaths of two Ralston children in 1932. Tension mounts as Marlowe learns she is replacing a deceased tour guide, and her supervisor mysteriously disappears soon after her arrival. The gradual revelation of the Ralston children's fate is a standout aspect, while the seemingly disconnected flashbacks to 1932 are skillfully interwoven, culminating in a satisfying conclusion that brings justice to the Ralston children. The pacing is steady, with a gradual buildup of suspense, and the author deftly balances the past and present, keeping the narrative engaging throughout.",

The angsty high school female protagonist, the eccentric ultra-rich guy's mansion set on fantastical grounds, and the tragic and mysterious deaths of the millionaire's children, along with a parallel murder in the present, were all elements that felt repetitive.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist's best friend in *Truly Devious* was a young, gay, black woman, and in this book, the same type of character is now her girlfriend. While this representation is appreciated, it didn't feel fresh or distinct enough from the previous series.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The story had too many plot holes, and the transition to the \"whodunnit\" reveal felt clunky and unbelievable. This made the mystery less satisfying to unravel.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  I did enjoy the layered backstory of the original homeowners, the Ralstons. The author tied up both mysteries without leaving me hanging, which I appreciated. Additionally, the dialogue was funny and engaging.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations:**  \n  While I found some aspects enjoyable, the lack of originality and the plot issues made it a less compelling read for me. I’m hopeful that the next book by this author, which we’ll be reading next month, will feel more original and polished.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its strengths, particularly in the backstory and dialogue, but the similarities to the author's previous work and the plot execution issues made it a disappointing read overall.

It was an enjoyable experience overall, and I think fans of Maureen Johnson will find it worth checking out.\n\n- **ARC Disclosure:**  \n  I received an Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) of this book through my Barnes and Noble Edelweiss account.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t quite capture the same teenage sleuth magic as the Truly Devious series, it still delivered Maureen Johnson’s signature humor, quirky characters, and atmospheric setting. It’s a fun read, especially for fans of the author, though it leans more toward a passive narrative than an active mystery.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

These factors make it hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

It made the audiobook a really enjoyable listen.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  This novel felt like a lighter version of the *Truly Devious* series, which I found to be an interesting comparison.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t connect with the main character as much; she remained clueless for a long time, which was frustrating. Additionally, the book had a large cast of characters for its length, and I didn’t feel particularly attached to any of them. This made it harder to keep track of everything.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Appeal:**  \n  I loved the combination of eugenics-horror and the eerie old mansion setting. The story kept me engaged, and I didn’t figure out the mystery before the climax, so the big reveal was well-executed and satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable listen with strong narration and an intriguing plot. While the main character and large cast were less compelling, the genre elements and mystery kept me hooked until the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

By then, I was already impatient and just wanted the story to move forward more quickly.\n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover of the book is absolutely gorgeous and visually appealing, which initially drew me to the novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its moments, particularly with Clara’s perspective and the eerie atmosphere of the Ralston family, I was ultimately disappointed by Marlowe’s passive role and the slow pacing of her sections. I had higher hopes for the story and wished it had focused more on Clara’s backstory and the 1932 timeline.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The past timeline is more captivating, evoking elements of shows like *The Umbrella Academy* (minus superpowers), and revolves around an eccentric elite family where a wealthy man adopts exceptional children and raises them unconventionally until tragedy strikes.

However, the plot felt disjointed and inconsistent, with an abrupt shift from a sapphic narrative to a mysterious invitation that lacked clarity. The mystery itself was lackluster, taking too long to develop and resolving too quickly, leaving little room for audience investment.",

Marlowe's abrupt transition from pining after Akilah to developing feelings for Riki appeared forced and unrealistic. Riki herself was presented as a clichéd dark and mysterious figure. Additionally, the dynamics within the friend group felt underexplored and didn't resonate. While Chris's storyline was the most compelling, it was disappointing that he wasn't a central character.",

            "Initially, the book captivated me with its dark humor and intriguing setup. However, as the story unfolded, I found it increasingly disappointing. By the halfway point, I was struck by the realization that the mystery hadn't even begun to develop—“It’s been 50%, and NOTHING has happened so far,” I thought. When the plot finally picked up around 70%, the resolution to the past mystery was wrapped up hastily in a single sentence, leaving me unsatisfied. I had hoped for excitement, but was instead greeted with the abrupt revelation of, “xxx killed xxx,” which felt like a letdown.\n\nThe present mystery proved equally underwhelming. While the outcome was unpredictable, it lacked engagement and clarity. The villain’s explanation was unsatisfactory, offering no logical reasoning or depth. The main character’s assumptions led to a frustrating exchange, where the murderer simply exclaimed, “You don’t understand!!!” This felt like a lazy and unconvincing resolution. Overall, I wanted thrill and intrigue, but was left wanting more.",
            "As a fan of the author, I approached this book with high expectations, but I was ultimately disappointed. I enjoy stories with dual timelines, especially those featuring intertwined murder mysteries. Sadly, the execution fell flat, leaving me underwhelmed.",

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the outcome.  \n   - I love books with dual storylines (past and present) and was excited to read the two murder mysteries taking place in both timelines. However, it was all very underwhelming.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The book started out fine—I was laughing at the dark humor and enjoying the setup. But as the story progressed, it fell flat.  \n   - By the 50% mark, I felt like the mystery itself hadn’t even begun. I kept thinking, “It’s been 50%, and NOTHING has happened so far.”  \n   - Around the 70% mark, when things finally started to get interesting, the past mystery was resolved in a single sentence.

While I couldn’t predict the outcome, it felt boring and confusing.  \n   - The villain’s explanation was lacking—there was no normal or satisfying reasoning. The main character made a bunch of assumptions, and the murderer just responded with, “You don’t understand!!!” It felt lazy and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Originality and Repetition:**  \n   - If you’ve read the *Truly Devious* series, you’ll notice a lack of originality in this book. Maureen reused a specific choice that she had already used in one of her previous books.

            "Around 70% into the story, I found myself skimming to the end. The build-up involving Akilah, the candle, and the ensuing house fire dragged on excessively. Overall, the narrative took itself too seriously, leaving me feeling bored. It's hard to believe that a group of teenagers would be allowed to stay on an isolated island with just one adult chaperone—especially when that chaperone goes missing and is presumed dead. Additionally, I would expect Akilah to have basic fire safety knowledge, such as understanding that oxygen fuels flames. Then there's the implausible plot twist where April drugs Marlowe and attempts to burn down the house after killing Professor Henson—simply because the professor might have witnessed her earlier crime. This sequence of events strained my suspension of disbelief.",

            "The story often veers away from its central mystery, getting bogged down by underdeveloped subplots, particularly in the romance department. This adversely affects the pacing, resulting in a disjointed and unfocused narrative. Rather than engaging readers with a satisfying resolution, the mystery is simply explained to them. The motivations behind both past and present murders are weak and unconvincing. Additionally, the revelation that the father is the biological parent of all the children feels irrelevant and lacks narrative weight. The missed opportunity for a compelling twist—such as a child committing murder based on inheritance assumptions—leaves the resolution feeling flat.",
            "The new cast of characters feels overly familiar, lacking originality. Marlowe's love interests are unengaging and excessively explored, which detracts from the central mystery. The focus on Riki as a potential love interest feels wasted, as their relationship fails to develop meaningfully.",
            "The themes of prohibition and eugenics are introduced but not thoroughly explored or integrated into the story. They come across as superficial, primarily serving as character interests rather than influencing the plot or motivations. Similarly, the treatment of serious topics, such as the Nazis in the fourth Truly Devious book, lacks depth and impact."

However, it didn’t live up to my expectations compared to her other work.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The present and past narration, which I typically enjoy, didn’t work well for this book. It felt a bit formulaic and didn’t capture the same magic as her previous novels.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I didn’t connect with any of the characters. Marlowe, in particular, was sometimes unbearable. While I understand the challenges of being a teenager in love and dealing with embarrassing situations, the story focused too much on this aspect, which made it harder to engage with her character.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict Resolution:**  \n  The miscommunication between Marlowe and Akilah felt unnecessary and could have been easily avoided. This added to my frustration with the story. However, I appreciated the guidance Marlowe received from Ricky toward the end, and I felt Ricky deserved more justice in the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I’m a fan of Maureen Johnson’s previous work, this book didn’t resonate with me.

It failed to deliver the cleverness, suspense, and charm I had hoped for, especially after enjoying the Truly Devious series. The lack of twists, weak character development, and anticlimactic plot made it a forgettable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low rating."

            "I'm genuinely puzzled by how this story fell short, especially given the author's evident skill in crafting compelling mysteries in their other works. The premise was intriguing, but the resolution ultimately proved to be a bizarre letdown. The motivations for the murders, particularly those involving April, were illogical and insufficiently explained. It felt absurd when her friends casually labeled her a murderer in just a few lines. Unity's storyline was similarly perplexing and unsatisfactory. The resolution was disappointing; the buildup suggested potential, but the way the mysteries unraveled felt rushed and irrational. Both April and Unity's roles as culprits lacked proper justification, leaving me bewildered and unfulfilled.",
            "April's role as the antagonist felt illogical. The notion that she killed Chris and Dr. Henderson simply because she *might* have been seen pushing Chris off a cliff was far-fetched. Additionally, her friends' casual acceptance of her as a murderer added to the absurdity. Unity's motivations were also unclear, leaving me feeling frustrated."

        "conclusion": "This novel had a promising premise but failed to deliver a satisfying mystery. The character motivations were weak, and the resolution felt rushed and illogical. Overall, it was a letdown compared to the author’s other works.",

The premise was promising, but the resolution felt like a wildly weird letdown. The motivations behind the murders, especially April’s, were nonsensical and poorly explained. The brief few paragraphs where her friends casually labeled her as a murderer felt absurd and unconvincing.

            "The story ultimately falls short, lacking both intrigue and meaningful mystery-solving. Marlowe's character is predominantly passive; she is drugged and nearly dies multiple times, while others drive the plot forward. The present timeline feels underdeveloped, with little action, while the past timeline is more engaging yet remains insufficiently explored. The concept of a mysterious house holding a deadly secret is captivating but largely underutilized, relegated to the background. Additionally, Marlowe's obsession with Akilah comes across as unrealistic and poorly executed, particularly given that they only shared one date. This romantic subplot distracts from more compelling elements, such as the mystery itself and the dynamics within the friend group. Overall, the relationship feels forced and unearned, overshadowing the story's more interesting aspects.",

In contrast, Riki was a well-developed character who would have made a much stronger protagonist. Additionally, Marlowe's obsession with Akilah felt unsettling, particularly given that Akilah lacked depth as a character."
