            "**Hanalei (Main Character):**  \nHanalei is a refreshing departure from typical female fantasy protagonists. Rather than relying on weapons or martial arts, she embodies strength and independence in a relatable and inspiring manner. Though she has a princess-like quality, it stems from resilience rather than entitlement, making her a character I genuinely admire and would want to emulate.\n\n**Sam:**  \nI was thoroughly taken with Sam. From the moment he reunited with Hanalei, it was evident he had always loved her. His character is compelling, and I found myself fully invested in their dynamic. While the romance serves as a minor subplot, I appreciated its subtlety and significance; it enriches the story without overshadowing the main narrative. If you're looking for a romance reminiscent of *Powerless*, this isn’t it, but it complements the plot beautifully.",

However, this book completely surprised me. The inclusion of seadragons instead of traditional fire-breathing dragons was infinitely cooler. The underwater setting added a unique and refreshing twist to the fantasy genre.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Hanalei (Main Character):**  \n    Hanalei was a breath of fresh air as a female fantasy protagonist. She wasn’t the typical “pull out a dagger and kill everyone” type or someone who relied on flashy karate moves. Instead, she was strong and independent in a way that felt relatable and inspiring. She had a princess-like quality, but not in a spoiled way—more like someone who’s been through hardships and is determined to overcome them. I never once rolled my eyes at her character; she was genuinely cool and someone I’d want to emulate.  \n  - **Sam:**  \n    I absolutely loved Sam. The moment he and Hanalei reunited, it was clear he had been in love with her all along. His character was compelling, and I don’t need to say much more—just yes, please.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in the book was a minor subplot, but I really enjoyed it. If you’re expecting something like *Powerless* romance vibes, this isn’t it. It was subtle yet meaningful, adding depth to the story without overshadowing the main plot.\n\n- **Writing and Themes:**  \n  The writing was beautiful, with lines like, “In the old tales, it is written that the egg of a seadragon, dragonfruit, holds within it the power to undo a person’s greatest sorrow. An unwanted marriage, a sworn enemy, a painful illness . . . gone. But as with all things that promise the moon and the stars and offer hope when hope has gone, the tale comes with a warning. Every wish demands a price.” This quote perfectly captures the book’s enchanting and thought-provoking themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations in every way. It offered a unique take on fantasy with its seadragons and underwater setting, featured a strong and relatable female protagonist, and included a subtle yet satisfying romance. The writing was poetic, and the themes of hope and sacrifice resonated deeply. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh and captivating fantasy read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n♡♡♡♡♡ (5/5)"

The concept of dragonfruit, which refers to dragon eggs in the book, was particularly intriguing. The inclusion of sea dragons added an exciting element to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot is beautifully crafted, starting with Hanalei’s life as a student studying dragons in the field. The story takes a dramatic turn when she is captured and forced to join a ship of dragon hunters due to her knowledge and special connection to dragons. Her escape leads her back to her home island, where she faces uncertainty about her acceptance after her father’s actions. The dual mission of saving the hunted dragons and the princess she once served adds complexity and tension to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Hanalei is a compelling protagonist, and her journey of self-discovery and redemption is deeply engaging. Her reunion with loved ones after over a decade apart is emotional, and the question of whether she will be accepted or shunned adds depth to her character arc. The themes of found family and second-chance romance further enrich her relationships.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story explores tragedy and social inequality, but it also balances these heavier themes with uplifting elements like found family, second-chance romance, and a happily-ever-after (HEA) ending. The emotional journey is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I strongly recommend this book to fans of YA fantasy, dragon stories, or anyone looking for a unique tale that highlights aspects of mythology.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dragonfruit* is a beautifully written fantasy novel that combines Pacific Islander mythology, compelling characters, and a richly developed plot.

After saving two dragons and their eggs, she is captured by a hunter and forced to assist in their hunt. The journey takes her back to Tamarind, where she confronts her history and teams up with Samahtitamahenele \"Sam,\" the last prince of Tamarind, who seeks a dragon egg to heal his mother. The plot explores themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and the consequences of pursuing one's deepest desires.\n\n- **World-Building & Magic:**  \n  The novel is set in a richly imagined fantasy world inspired by Pacific Islander mythology and history. While the story primarily unfolds on Tamarind, the inclusion of other islands, external influences (such as white colonizers), and detailed histories makes the world feel expansive and alive. The magic system is unique, featuring seadragon eggs that grant wishes at a terrible cost and magical tattoos (markings) that transform into living creatures with distinct personalities and abilities.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Hana and Sam are compelling protagonists. Hana is a brave, compassionate, and independent young woman burdened by her past and her love for seadragons. Sam, the last prince of Tamarind, struggles with societal expectations and his desire to save his mother. While Sam occasionally feels underdeveloped, he remains an enjoyable character. The side characters, including the memorable Vatuu, add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes & Tone:**  \n  The novel explores complex themes such as greed, sacrifice, family, and the weight of history. It poses the central question: \"How far would you go to achieve your deepest desire, and are you willing to pay the price?\" The tone is intense and at times disturbing, making it more suitable for older YA readers and adults.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book contains graphic and violent scenes, including general violence, blood, injury, vore (a seadragon devours children and adults), animal cruelty and death, consumption of dead dragon babies, off-page death of parents, magical sleep, and attempted sexual assault. These elements make it unsuitable for younger readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dragonfruit* is a well-crafted oceanic fantasy that blends Pacific Islander mythology with a unique magic system and compelling characters. While it is marketed as a YA novel, its intense and mature themes make it more appropriate for older teens and adults. The story is a thought-provoking exploration of desire, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions, wrapped in a richly imagined world.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐, rounded up to 5 ⭐ for GR."

            "The romance in the story showed promise, particularly through Sam’s evident obsession with Hanalei. However, the lack of internal perspective made it challenging to grasp their emotions—whether they were flustered, wary from separation, or simply distracted by one another. This absence of emotional depth diminished the enjoyment of the romantic subplot. The narrative’s use of third-person objective for most of the story, shifting to third-person limited in the final quarter, was a significant flaw.

As a result, decisions and events sometimes felt unclear, as I struggled to understand the characters’ internal reasoning.",

I forget and it was a library book🫣) relationship was written; it took a pleasantly unexpected turn for me.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  There was a lot less romance than I've seen it described as having, which is totally fine by me, but it was a super subplot. The romance was sweet though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its unique setting, engaging mythology, and well-written characters.

She teams up with Prince Samahti (Sam) on a quest to find a Dragonfruit—a wish-granting egg from a Seadragon—to awaken his mother, Princess Oliana, from a ten-year coma. Along the way, they confront Dragoners, sailors who hunt dragons for profit, while grappling with the moral dilemma that “every wish demands a price.” The story weaves themes of redemption and sacrifice, making it a compelling read.",
            "Hanalei and Sam are well-crafted characters with distinct motivations. Hanalei’s internal struggle—her desire to help Sam’s mother while fearing the repercussions of her wish—is particularly compelling. Sam’s guilt over Hanalei’s suffering due to his father’s crime feels genuine. I also appreciated how both Sam and his grandmother, Queen Maga’lahi, consistently reassure Hanalei of her innocence and the value of her presence.",
            "The immersive, Polynesian-inspired setting was beautifully crafted, enriching the story. The intriguing magic system, where young adults in Tamarindi receive guardian animal tattoos, added depth. Sam's fruit bat, Fetu, and the Queen's banana spider, Viti, introduced unique elements that enhanced both the plot and character dynamics.",

            "I felt a deep connection with Hanalei, a character who has been on the run for ten years and finds herself back near her home. The relationships among Hanalei, Sam, Isko, Rosamie, and Sam’s grandma are authentic and distinct, avoiding clichéd tropes. I particularly appreciated the evolving friendship between Hanalei and Rosamie, though some of their issues remained unresolved. ",

However, this ambiguity isn’t the focal point, which I appreciated. The standout element was the magical tattoos that characters receive at a certain age. These tattoos not only shift across the body but can also leave it to perform tasks such as delivering messages or frightening ships.

I felt a strong connection with the sea dragons, hunted for profit and having their eggs stolen by selfish individuals.

She’s been on the run for 10 years but ends up back near her home. The relationships between Hanalei, Sam, Isko, Rosamie, and Sam’s grandma felt authentic and distinct, with no copy-paste characters.

            "The main character's special abilities were rooted in well-constructed worldbuilding, lending a sense of realism to her powers and preventing them from feeling overly convenient. Rather than providing easy solutions, her abilities added depth to the narrative. Each character's actions and outcomes, even those I found unsatisfactory, like Captain Erro’s fate, were consistent with the established world and aligned with their personalities.",

It beautifully encapsulates the essence of island life, making it an ideal read after a Hawaiian getaway. The immersive worldbuilding is both authentic and well-developed, drawing you into its magical setting. The seadragons are particularly enchanting, evoking a sense of awe reminiscent of my early experiences with the Pern series, yet they stand out in their own right. I found the concept of magical markings—essentially magical tattoos that serve as animal familiars—fascinating, especially the two new markings introduced in the story, which quickly became my favorites.",

            "This story features sea dragons, an exiled noble, and a prince seeking a marriage partner. The dragon eggs, known as dragon fruit, can fulfill any wish, but at the cost of something taken without consent. While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I felt it emphasized the journey more than character development.",
            "In the story, Hanalei, the protagonist, endures traumatic events, yet the exploration of their impact on her mental health feels insufficient. While other characters express sympathy for her, readers don’t witness the manifestations of PTSD or other consequences stemming from her experiences. Although the darker plot elements are acknowledged, they are swiftly brushed aside. On a positive note, the book excels in portraying female friendships, depicting two women who, instead of becoming rivals for a man, forge a genuine friendship. While this isn't a primary focus, I hope to see their relationship further develop in future installments.",

While I wished for deeper character development, more intricate world-building, and a less rushed ending, the unique setting and quick-moving plot made it a worthwhile experience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Storytelling and Author's Skill:**  \n  Makiia Lucier is a masterful storyteller, and I’ll read anything she ever writes. Her ability to craft magical stories that stand out in the oversaturated YA fantasy market is truly impressive.  \n\n- **Main Character (Hanalei):**  \n  Hanalei is a compelling protagonist with strong morals, grit, and passion. Despite growing up in exile and enduring abuse during forced child labor, she remains steadfast in her values and never makes immoral choices. Her fascination with seadragons and her respect for their individuality make her a unique and inspiring character. She’s a role model for young girls—someone who follows her heart and mind while staying true to herself.  \n\n- **Love Interest (Sam):**  \n  Sam, the Prince of Tamarind and Hanalei’s childhood friend, is a refreshing love interest. Unlike the typical broody characters, Sam is charming, loyal, and genuinely good-hearted. His dedication to his family and friends, along with his kindness, makes him a standout character in a world that often feels bleak.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is mesmerizing, drawing from rich Pacific Island mythology and featuring a matriarchal society. The inclusion of seadragons adds a magical and authentic layer to the story. The setting is so vivid and enchanting that even simple moments, like watching seadragons and dolphins play, feel awe-inspiring.  \n\n- **Themes and Plot:**  \n  The themes of second chances, forgiveness, and the price of magic are woven seamlessly into the plot. The story explores these ideas with depth and nuance, offering a refreshing perspective on redemption and unconditional second chances. The plot itself has surprising twists, but the emotional and thematic core of the story is what truly stands out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dragonfruit* is a brilliant YA fantasy that is both compelling and magical. With its strong, inspiring characters, mesmerizing worldbuilding, and beautifully conveyed themes, it’s a must-read. I hope teens discover this story and find inspiration in Hanalei’s passion and the characters’ journeys toward finding home and second chances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot was engaging, but the stakes often felt low.

While I might have normally rated it a 4 due to the lack of urgency, the slower pace worked perfectly for me, earning it a 5. The plot revolves around Hanalei and Sam’s quest for the dragonfruit, intertwined with themes of greed, sacrifice, and cost. The story avoids focusing heavily on romance, instead letting the budding affection between Hanalei and Sam remain an undercurrent that adds flavor without overwhelming the narrative.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The island setting was lush and vividly descriptive, creating a perfect backdrop for a seafaring adventure involving pirates and seadragons. I particularly appreciated the Pacific Island naming conventions and cultural elements, which added depth and authenticity to the world.\n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the story was light and subtle, though I felt it shouldn’t have been limited to the island. The inclusion of seadragons and magic tattoos added a unique and enchanting layer to the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were well-developed, with Hanalei and Sam’s personal journeys and struggles feeling authentic and compelling. Their growth and the choices they face—such as Sam’s dilemma between marriage and finding a cure for his mother—added emotional weight to the story.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The themes of greed, sacrifice, and the cost of desires were explored thoughtfully and resonated throughout the story. The warning about the dangers of the dragonfruit itself added a layer of tension and moral complexity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully crafted, slower-paced fantasy that offers a lush island setting, well-developed characters, and a unique magic system.

Despite societal pressures to compete for a man’s affection, Hanalei and Rosamie build a deep connection and support each other unconditionally. It’s refreshing to read about women who are confident and resilient, unwavering in their bond regardless of external challenges.",

The magic woven throughout the narrative was truly enchanting, as it brought the concept of tattoos coming to life as friends, companions, and protectors to fruition—a beautiful dream realized.\n\nMy only critique is that I wished the book could have been longer, perhaps 800 pages, as I yearned to delve deeper into the rich world of the Island of Tamarind. I appreciated how Hanalei was welcomed back into her home and culture, despite leaving due to family circumstances. The celebration of her return emphasizes that the fault lies not with the child but with the decisions made for them.\n\nThe portrayal of a matriarchal society was particularly compelling, illustrating a profound respect for women and elders. This community operates on principles of mutual support and equality, where it is deemed shameful not to assist fellow islanders in need, fostering a sense of collective responsibility under the law."

I wish we could have delved deeper into the world of the Island of Tamarind, and if I had any one criticism, it would be that I wish the book was 800 pages long.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of this book was the portrayal of strong and healthy female friendships. Even when society might have put pressure on two women to compete for the affections of a man, Hanalei and Rosamie connected and didn’t let their situations in life stop them from caring for one another and forming a strong bond. It was refreshing to read about women who are strong, self-assured, and don’t let men come between them.  \n\n- **Cultural and Social Themes:**  \n  I loved how Hanalei was immediately treated at her homecoming. Despite having to leave due to another family member’s decisions, she was welcomed and celebrated back into her home and culture by those who matter most. The story highlights that fault does not lie with the child decisions were made for. The matriarchal society storyline was particularly compelling, showcasing respect for females and elders in the community. It’s a community where it’s shameful not to help fellow islanders in need, and where all are treated equally under the law.  \n\n- **Emotional and Immersive Experience:**  \n  This story took me to such a beautiful place, one that I hope still exists or can again one day. If you are an animal lover or a believer in spirit animals, you will LOVE this read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully immersive and magical story that celebrates strong female friendships, a matriarchal society, and a deeply respectful and communal culture. While I wished for more depth in the world-building, the emotional and thematic elements made it a truly special read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The quest for the dragonfruit unfolds only after the first 60% of the book, but the initial half effectively builds the world and characters. The journey remains focused on a single goal rather than spanning multiple locations, which suits the story well. With its relaxed yet engaging pacing, the narrative offers a comforting reading experience.",
            "Hanalei and Sam are captivating protagonists whose chemistry instantly won me over. Their childhood friends-to-lovers dynamic is expertly crafted, grounded in a solid friendship and an authentic recognition of the decade that has elapsed between them. Both characters possess distinct motivations and undergo meaningful personal growth, making them feel genuine and relatable. The addition of Lady Rosamie, a nuanced female friend to Hanalei, enriches the narrative, and I particularly appreciated the omission of the clichéd Female Cattiness Over a Boy subplot.",

            "This novel impresses with its unique Pacific Islander-based mythology and intricately detailed world. The first half serves as a lush introduction filled with magical animal tattoos, seadragons, and the political dynamics among various nations. I was completely immersed in this vivid setting, which made the slower pacing feel enjoyable rather than tedious.",

The portrayal of betrayals and hidden depths within the characters is skillfully executed, featuring just the right amount of foreshadowing to keep the twists believable yet surprising. The ending resonates perfectly with the protagonists’ age and their willingness to embrace the world."

The first half of the book is a lush introduction to this new world, including magical animal tattoos, seadragons, and the political dynamics between different nations. I found myself fully immersed in this setting, which made the slower build-up enjoyable rather than tedious.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Hanalei and Sam are deeply compelling protagonists who won my heart from their introduction. Their childhood friends-to-lovers trope is well-executed, with a strong foundation of friendship and a realistic acknowledgment of the ten years that have passed between them. Both characters have distinct motivations and personal growth arcs, making them feel authentic and relatable. Lady Rosamie, a complex female friend to Hanalei, adds depth to the story, and I appreciated the absence of the overused Female Cattiness Over a Boy subplot.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the main quest to find the dragonfruit doesn’t begin until 60% into the book, the first half serves as a satisfying build-up, introducing the world and characters. The journey itself is intentionally contained, focusing on a specific goal rather than spanning multiple locations, which felt appropriate for the story. The pacing is relaxed yet engaging, making it a comforting read.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The novel explores themes of friendship, love, and self-discovery in a way that feels genuine and heartfelt. Betrayals and hidden depths in characters are executed skillfully, with enough foreshadowing to make them believable but not predictable. The ending is perfect for the protagonists’ age and their readiness to embrace the world.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  While not a \"cozy\" fantasy, the book has a relaxing and immersive tone.

            "I enjoyed the plot tension surrounding the quest for the dragon egg to save Sam's mother, who was in a Sleeping Beauty-like predicament. The fear of the consequences of using the egg heightened the stakes. However, the resolution felt anticlimactic when Hana discovered that her own blood could revive the sleeping princess, which was disappointing.",

            "The book is marketed as young adult, but it feels more all-ages than strictly YA. The initial premise, featuring Sam pursued by several young women, suggests a romantic storyline akin to Cinderella. However, the romance is very tame, with the most intimate moment being a kiss on Hanalei’s hand. While their friendship rekindles and there are hints of attraction, I was left wondering if they ever expressed their feelings; if they did, it happened off-page. I wouldn’t classify this book as a romance, but I would love to see a sequel that explores a will-they-won’t-they dynamic, as I find that aspect intriguing."

The marks that most people had, which could turn corporeal, and the matriarchal society all felt so refreshing and unique.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Lucier has a pretty simple way of writing, but the story was fun and beautiful. It really took me on an adventure and kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I'm a little confused by the marketing of this book as a romantic fantasy or romantasy. The romance is subtle and very minor, not really a driving part of the plot at all. I think it was marketed this way to appeal to the current boom in romantasy readers, but if they pick this up expecting a strong romantic focus, they're going to be disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I adored this book for its refreshing setting, engaging world-building, and adventurous storytelling.

It had everything: fantasy/magic, pirates, dragons, a quest, heartbreak, hope, and love. Plus, there were a few twists that I didn't see coming.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  There is a bit of romance in the book. It could have gone a little deeper with it, but I was happy that it at least stayed PG-13 and let the main story take precedence.  \n\n- **Desire for More:**  \n  I know it's a standalone, but I'd totally read more if there ever was one.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  Side note: I love the cover!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this YA novel delivered an engaging and well-rounded story with a mix of fantasy, adventure, and emotional depth. While the romance could have been explored further, it didn’t overshadow the main plot, and the unexpected twists kept me hooked. I’d eagerly read more if a sequel were ever written.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The dynamic between the prince and the exile is well-developed, and I appreciated how much of the royal family seeks to atone for their past mistakes. The childhood friends-to-lovers trope is executed effectively, creating an authentic and immediate connection between Sam and Hanalei. The romance is more subtle than expected, serving as a subplot rather than the main focus. I found the open-ended nature of their relationship refreshing, as it aligns beautifully with the YA theme of self-discovery over romantic resolution.",

While it navigates complex subjects, it does so with a light touch, steering clear of overly heavy matters.

Notably, there's an undercurrent of brutality embodied by a villain whose violence is both poignant and artfully portrayed."

            "The story follows Hanalie, whose father steals a Dragonfruit to save her life, ultimately leading to significant consequences. She endures tremendous challenges and faces a heartbreaking choice: save the Queen or sacrifice an unborn seadragon and potentially her loved ones. While the concept of wishes granted by unborn seadragons is intriguing, it lacks adequate explanation, leaving many questions unanswered. The pacing feels inconsistent; the book seems rushed and expansive for its brief length, resulting in unresolved plot threads, including Hanalie's past encounter with the antagonist and the origins of the magic system. Overall, the story feels incomplete, as if the author hurriedly penned it without fully developing its ideas.",

Sam, the love interest, is frustratingly blind to his own hypocrisy as he criticizes his cousin while asking Hanalie for a major sacrifice. In contrast, Jejomar, the cousin, has a more compelling arc and undergoes meaningful growth, making him a potentially more interesting protagonist than Hanalie. The hint of a love story between Jejomar and William presents an engaging possibility that could have outshined the central romance between Sam and Hanalie.",

While these elements were present, they were executed on a much smaller and less engaging scale than I had hoped.  \n\n- **Pacing and Stakes:**  \n  The story lacked a sense of urgency or high stakes. Even during scenes that should have been exciting, like a sea dragon hunting their boat or setting up a trap for dragoners, I found myself feeling indifferent. The events didn’t come together to create a compelling narrative.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the story or care about what happened. The plot and characters failed to evoke any strong emotions, leaving me disengaged throughout.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt abrupt and somewhat fantastical, which didn’t align with the tone of the rest of the book. It left me with unanswered questions and a sense of dissatisfaction.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was a personal read outside of book clubs or buddy reads, and I was disappointed that it didn’t live up to my expectations. It felt like a flop, and I’m ready to move on to the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing concept and some of the elements I was looking for, it failed to deliver on its potential. The lack of stakes, emotional engagement, and a satisfying ending made it a disappointing read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

The idea of dragonfruit being able to wipe away sorrows and the intertwining fates of Hanalei and Sam sounded intriguing and beautiful. I was initially drawn to the story because of its originality and cultural inspiration.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was dull and lacked engagement. Despite the promising premise, the execution felt flat, making it difficult to stay invested in the story. The narrative dragged, and I found myself struggling to get through it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I did not connect with the main characters, Hanalei and Sam. Their motivations and personalities failed to resonate with me, and I found myself indifferent to their quest and struggles.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story felt like a slog to read. While the concept was interesting, the plot lacked excitement and failed to hold my attention. The pacing was slow, and I didn’t feel compelled to care about the outcome of the quest.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  On a positive note, the book avoided the common YA trope of centering the story around a romance. Instead, it focused on the main plot, which was refreshing. However, this aspect didn’t compensate for the overall lack of engagement.  \n\n- **Personal Recommendation:**  \n  I borrowed this book from the library, which I think was the right choice. While I might consider reading another book by this author in the future, I would likely borrow it rather than purchase it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a fascinating concept rooted in Pacific Island mythology, the dull writing, unengaging characters, and slow pacing made it a disappointing read for me. The lack of a romance subplot was a positive, but it wasn’t enough to salvage my overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It seems to function solely to serve the plot's needs rather than adhering to any established rules.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The novel's saving grace is its unique setting—a fantasy version of the Pacific Islands with sea-dwelling dragons.

The plot centers around a legend that dragon fruit, referred to as \"eggs,\" can heal severe ailments, from sickness to troubled marriages and even endless slumber.

            "This story centers on the legend of the dragonfruit, the egg of a seadragon that possesses the power to alleviate a person’s deepest sorrow, albeit at a significant cost. The protagonist, Hanalei, lives in exile after her father used the dragonfruit to save her life. Now, she devotes herself to studying seadragons in hopes of rescuing the princess, who is like a mother to her. Meanwhile, Samahtitamahenele (Sam), the princess's son, grapples with pressure from his grandmother, the queen, to marry and produce female heirs, as only men can inherit the throne. The return of his childhood friend offers him renewed hope of reviving his mother.\n\nThe dragonfruit itself is highly coveted, with many willing to kill for a chance to redress their greatest sorrows. The narrative is generally fast-paced and engaging, though it occasionally falls short in its world-building and the intricacies of its magical system, which may leave some readers wanting more clarity.",
            "Hanalei emerges as a compelling protagonist, motivated by her quest to save the princess and seek redemption for her father's misdeeds. Sam grapples with an internal conflict between his loyalty to the throne and his personal desires, enriching his character. The emotional core of the story lies in the complex relationship between Hanalei and Sam, underscored by their shared past.",
            "The world is captivating, featuring seadragons that are hunted for their scales, oil, meat, and valuable eggs. However, the magic system, especially the tattoos, lacks clarity. It's puzzling why the tattoos operate beyond the border while other forms of magic do not, which may create challenges for Hanalei's future.",

The emotional burden of the dragonfruit's price is powerfully illustrated, as one character faces a cost worse than death. Meanwhile, the seadragons' plight generates sympathy and highlights real-world issues, such as whale hunting."

Furthermore, the wish granted to Sam's cousin after eating a dragonfruit appears delayed compared to others, while the overall rules of the magic system remain unclear, contributing to a sense of inconsistency throughout the narrative.",
            "The characters in the story were a significant disappointment. While Hanalei showed some potential, her motivations were inconsistent. I appreciated her passion for seadragons, but I wished for a deeper exploration of her conflicted feelings about a quest that involved harming seadragon babies and possibly their parents. Although the villain, Bragadin, was intriguing, he felt underutilized. The other human characters, especially Sam, lacked depth and failed to engage me, leaving me indifferent to their fates.

The world felt alive to me—the islands, the food, the seadragons, and the unique concept of animal companions living in tattoos that come out at various times. I especially loved the fruit bat companion featured on the cover.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - The characters were a major letdown for me. Hanalei was somewhat interesting, but her motivations felt inconsistent. I appreciated her love for seadragons, but I wanted more exploration of her conflicted feelings about the quest, which involved harming seadragon babies and possibly their parents. The villain, Bragadin, was compelling but underutilized. The rest of the human characters, particularly Sam, felt flat and unengaging. I didn’t care about their fates, and the romance lacked emotional depth.\n\n- **Animal Brutality:**\n   - The animal brutality in this book was deeply upsetting. The premise revolves around eating baby seadragons to undo sorrow, which I found disturbing. However, the most horrifying moments involved the dog being turned into a tree to demonstrate a curse and the fruit bat companion being turned into soup, which the main characters ate. These scenes were unnecessarily cruel and crossed a line for me. I would have preferred human deaths over the senseless harm to animals.\n\n- **Continuity and Magic System:**\n   - There were several continuity errors and inconsistencies in the magic system. For example, Fetu the bat was turned into soup, but later, his remains (presumably bones) were burned on a pyre, which was confusing and poorly explained. Additionally, Sam’s cousin’s wish from eating a dragonfruit seemed delayed compared to others, and the rules of the magic system were unclear, making the story feel inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the worldbuilding was immersive and creative, the flat characters, disturbing animal brutality, and inconsistencies in the plot and magic system significantly detracted from my enjoyment of the book. The callous treatment of animals, in particular, was a major issue for me, overshadowing the story’s potential. I wanted to love this book, but I couldn’t get past these flaws.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5 stars rounded up."

            "The story leaves several plot points unresolved, particularly the school's research on dragons and the ramifications of the ruler's murder. This significant event is swiftly overshadowed, which feels implausible, especially considering Sam’s position as a prince and the political consequences for Tamarind.",
            "The main characters' violent treatment of seadragons and their quest for unhatched dragon eggs for personal gain were deeply unsettling. Justifying the hunting of these eggs to potentially cure the queen of Tamarind felt morally questionable and ultimately unjustifiable.",
            "The Pacific Islander-inspired fantasy setting is both intriguing and unique, offering a fresh backdrop that I hadn't encountered before. However, the concept of a school dedicated to researching dragons, while fascinating, feels underdeveloped and lacks clarity. Additionally, the magic system, especially the animal-like markings, is insufficiently explained. Key questions regarding how the markings operate, their limitations, and their duration remain unanswered, which detracts from the overall depth of the magic.",

            "This book defied my expectations for a dragon-centric story. Rather than featuring a narrative of friendship and collaboration between humans and dragons, it portrayed humans as the true villains, making for a challenging read."

Additionally, the pervasive violence toward dragons and the acceptance of child labor made the story difficult to enjoy. This book was not what I expected, and I have no plans to revisit it.",

While the format added to the experience, it might have contributed to some confusion in following the story at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and refreshing read with strong characters, engaging mythology, and a mix of adventure and family themes. While the plot occasionally felt confusing, the story’s charm and the girl MC’s badass personality made it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️ 3.8"

Hanalei is an intriguing character with a caring heart, especially when compared to the less developed characters around her. Her passion for studying seadragons, linked to her unique healing experience, adds depth to her character. However, despite her compelling nature, her development sometimes feels incomplete. The romantic relationship lacks the chemistry I hoped for, relying too much on off-screen growth rather than direct interaction, which ultimately diminishes its impact for me.",

Her covers are always amazing, and the blurbs catch my attention every time.  \n\n- **Main Character (Hanalei):**  \n   - The book is told from one point-of-view, Hanalei’s. She becomes an outcast and is forbidden from returning to her home island due to what her father did to save her life. A parent’s love knows no bounds.  \n   - I thought she was an interesting character with a very caring heart, unlike some of the other characters in the book.  \n   - She loves studying seadragons and has a gift for finding them, likely due to how she was cured.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Other characters in the book didn’t get as fleshed out as Hanalei, but even her development fell a bit flat at times.  \n   - The relationship forming lacked the chemistry I was looking for. There wasn’t a lot of showing, and most of the development happened behind-the-scenes. Those types of relationships just never work for me.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n   - I did like the world the author created, especially the creatures, islands, and the magic system.  \n   - Mythology is something I love to read about, and it’s cool to see another culture represented in the YA genre.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Critique:**  \n   - Overall, this was good, but I think it would have been better with a bit more fleshing out of the characters and the romance.  \n   - It definitely makes for a quick read, though!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging main character and a richly imagined world, the character development and romantic relationships felt underdeveloped.

Hanalei's character inconsistently oscillates between a \"badass academic\" and a \"never-wrong Mary Sue.\" While some storylines among the large cast are resolved more satisfactorily than others, overall character development feels lacking.

I appreciate the seamless integration of environmentalism, conservation, and the interplay of faith and science. The lore surrounding dragonfruit, the unique island cultures, seadragons, kelpies, magical animal companions, and the quirky currency of \"squid\" form a captivating and charming microcosm.

The island summery vibes were enjoyable and added a unique atmosphere to the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t feel a strong connection to any of the characters. I would have loved more character development, especially for Sam and Hanalei, and more relationship development between them.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  It was a pretty easy read, and I finished it in a day. The pacing made it accessible and engaging.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  It’s definitely a young adult novel, and I think it’s something my 14-year-old might enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked the book but didn’t love it. While the plot, world-building, and summery vibes were appealing, the lack of character and relationship development left me wanting more. It’s a quick, enjoyable read, particularly suited for a younger audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story features a slow-burn, sweet romance rooted in the friends-to-lovers trope, which I adore. However, I felt that this romance remained somewhat in the background. The main plot revolves around a girl returning home to confront her father's past mistakes and help her community recognize that seadragons are more than just violent creatures meant for poaching.",

I am trying to be a \"fantasy girly\" when I am not.  \n   - This was lovely, just not my kind of thing, and it will sadly, most likely fade to the back of my mind compared to other stories, which I have had stronger feelings about.  \n\n- **Writing Style and World-Building:**  \n   - The writing felt quick but carefully crafted and painted a beautiful, bright, tropical fantasy world.  \n   - As an island girl myself, I very much appreciated this book and its beautiful seadragons.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - The romance was slow burn and sweet (friends to lovers trope, which I love!) but very much at the background of the story, in my opinion.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story is that of a girl returning home, wanting to right the wrongs of her father and help her people see that seadragons are much more than violent creatures meant to be poached.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience Fit:**  \n   - It should be on so many people's radar!  \n   - I am hoping this book finds its people. I am passing my copy along to a friend that I think will enjoy it more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t fully resonate with me due to my personal preferences, I found it to be a beautifully crafted tropical fantasy with a meaningful story and a sweet romance subplot.

I wish the entire narrative had followed this path, as it would have allowed for deeper exploration of the side characters rather than introducing numerous unnecessary ones.",
            "**Review:**\n\nHanalei's character left me frustrated. While her love for the seadragons is clear, it often overshadows her concern for people. For instance, when a seadragon consumes 30 individuals, she prioritizes saving the creature over the victims, even trying to dissuade Sam from killing it despite the danger it poses. Her rationale for the seadragon's actions, like the dismissive phrase “a girl has to eat,” feels unrealistic and tone-deaf. \n\nThe romance between Hanalei and Sam fell flat for me. Although I generally prefer “first-meet” romances over reconnections, their reunion after a decade lacked tension and chemistry. It felt as if no time had passed, and there was no engaging banter or emotional buildup to make their relationship compelling. \n\nAdditionally, the story suffered from an overabundance of minor characters who contributed little to the plot. Many scenes felt extraneous, detracting from the main characters and their interactions, particularly in a story that is already concise. Some subplots, such as the random man who murders a dog and turns people into trees, perplexed me. This subplot was confusing, especially since he continued to interact with his family despite the consequences of his actions. \n\nThe abandoned egg subplot was similarly illogical. Why did the seadragon abandon one egg and not the others? When Jejomar eats it and brings home the rest, the secrecy surrounding this decision lacked clear reasoning. Overall, the story's direction was muddled, and I wish it had focused more on the main characters and their development.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the Pacific Oceanic/Islander setting of this story. Its uniqueness in the fantasy genre is refreshing, and I particularly appreciated the vivid descriptions of the beaches, oceans, and pavilions. We need to see more settings like this in fantasy!"

It’s super unique for fantasy, and I loved the descriptions of the beaches, oceans, and pavilions. We need to see more of this kind of setting in fantasy!\n\n- **Character Development (Hanalei):**\n   - Hanalei frustrated me. While I understand her love for the seadragons, she seems to care more about them than people. For example, when a seadragon eats 30 people, she tries to stop Sam from killing it, even though she knows it’s dangerous. Later, she suggests cutting into its stomach to save the swallowed people, which makes me question her priorities. Her justification for the seadragon’s actions, like saying “girl has to eat,” felt tone-deaf and unrealistic.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The pacing was odd. I never felt fully invested in the main plot because the story seemed to bounce around without a clear direction. The last third of the book, which was more of an adventure/quest, was the best part. I wish the entire book had been like that, as it would have allowed for deeper exploration of side characters instead of introducing so many unnecessary ones.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - I didn’t feel the romance between Hanalei and Sam. While I personally prefer “meet for the first time” romances over reconnecting ones, the lack of tension and chemistry between them was disappointing. They reunited after 10 years, but it felt like no time had passed. There was no fun banter or emotional buildup to make their relationship compelling.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**\n   - There were too many named characters who didn’t add much to the story. Many scenes with these characters felt unnecessary and didn’t impact the plot. The book is already short, so I would have preferred more focus on the main characters and their interactions.\n   - Some subplots were baffling, like the random man who murdered a dog and turned people into trees. It felt unnecessary and confusing, especially since he kept touching his family despite knowing the consequences.\n   - The abandoned egg subplot also didn’t make sense. Why did the seadragon abandon one egg but not the others? And when Jejomar eats it and brings some home, it’s supposed to be a secret, but the logic behind these choices was unclear.\n\n- **Moral and Ethical Dilemmas:**\n   - Hanalei’s moral stance on the dragonfruit and seadragons felt inconsistent. She gets mad at Sam for wanting to save his mother, who is in a coma, even though she would likely do the same in his position. Her ability to cure the princess at the end felt convenient, and I felt she should have a greater sense of responsibility to help others if she has such a powerful ability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I appreciated the unique Pacific Oceanic/Islander setting and the refreshing standalone nature of the book, I was ultimately disappointed. The pacing was uneven, the romance lacked tension, and many subplots and character choices felt unnecessary or confusing. Despite enjoying the setting and writing style, the story didn’t fully deliver on its potential.

While the plot is engaging, it often moves too quickly, leaving little room to fully explore the world and develop the characters. Although there are stakes involved, they don't always feel as high as they could, resulting in a desire for greater tension and suspense.",

Hana's guilt surrounding her father's death and the unintended consequences of the dragonfruit add depth to her character, while Sam's struggle with responsibilities and his desire to save his mother serves as a compelling motivation for his actions. Despite understanding their motivations, I wished for a deeper exploration of their lives and inner struggles, as I never felt fully connected to them.",

The exploration of this mythology and the inclusion of sea dragons are standout elements that enhance the overall experience.",

            "The story unfolds against an intriguing backdrop centered around a legend of dragonfruit that grants wishes at a cost. The plot follows Hanalei, a poisoned page who recovers thanks to the dragonfruit, as she embarks on a quest to save Prince Sam's mother. Unfortunately, the narrative is predictable, lacking significant twists, and the sparse descriptions diminish its immersive quality. The reliance on interruptions and deus ex machina moments undermines character agency and can feel tiresome. Additionally, the emotional payoffs lack adequate buildup, leaving key moments feeling rushed and less impactful.",
            "In this story, Hanalei and Prince Sam serve as the main POV characters, but their voices are nearly indistinguishable, and the lack of introspection leaves them feeling flat. While both characters experience minor growth, their personalities lack depth. The romance is minimal, which is a positive aspect, as it allows their individual goals to shine. Unfortunately, the side characters are underdeveloped, devoid of significant conflicts or stakes, which undermines the authenticity of their relationships. However, the animal companions, Fetu and Viti, emerge as charming highlights of the narrative. The cover art is visually stunning and effectively captures the book's tone.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n   - The story is set against an intriguing backdrop involving a legend about dragonfruit, which grants wishes at a price.  \n   - The plot follows Hanalei, a poisoned page who recovers thanks to the dragonfruit, and her journey to save Prince Sam's mother.  \n   - The story is predictable with no major twists, and the writing is sparse in descriptions, making it less immersive.  \n   - The narrative relies heavily on interruptions and deus ex machina moments, which reduce character agency and feel tiresome.  \n   - Emotional payoffs lack proper buildup, making key moments feel glossed over and less impactful.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Hanalei and Prince Sam are the main POV characters, but their voices sound identical, and there’s little introspection, making them feel bland.  \n   - Both characters undergo minor development, but their personalities lack depth.  \n   - The romance is minimal, which is appreciated as it doesn’t overshadow their individual goals.  \n   - Side characters are underdeveloped, with no major conflicts or stakes, making their relationships feel unearned.  \n   - The animal companions, Fetu and Viti, are standout characters and add charm to the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The Pacific Islands setting is the book’s strongest aspect, with rich heritage and customs.  \n   - The concept of magical tattoo markings that transform into creatures is unique and well-executed.  \n   - The magic system is soft but fits the tone of the narrative.  \n\n- **Presentation:**  \n   - The cover is visually stunning and effectively conveys the tone of the book.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book’s strengths lie in its setting and worldbuilding, which offer a refreshing departure from typical medieval European fantasy.  \n   - Weaknesses include underdeveloped characters, sparse writing, and an overreliance on plot interruptions.  \n   - Despite its flaws, it’s a recommended read for those seeking a unique and refreshing fantasy setting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel excels in its exotic setting and imaginative worldbuilding, offering a refreshing take on fantasy. However, it falls short in character development and technical execution, with predictable plot points and sparse descriptions. While the story has its flaws, it’s worth reading for its unique cultural backdrop and creative magic system.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The plot felt messy and overwhelming, at times even boring, due to the sheer volume of events, which made it difficult to stay engaged. However, the story sidestepped common YA tropes like community ostracism for the protagonist—a refreshing change. The characters' endings were both realistic and satisfying, as each achieved their goals in a meaningful and grounded way.",
            "Hanalei, Jejomar, and Fetu stand out as the most well-crafted and engaging characters in the story. Hanalei's emotional growth is particularly compelling, while Jejomar experiences a satisfying character arc. Fetu's death is also poignantly affecting. However, many other characters feel underdeveloped due to the plot's overcrowding. Notably, Rosamie has great potential, but her development feels rushed, and her friendship with Hanalei lacks authenticity.",

This immersive setting made the story more engaging than many other fantasy novels.

            "The story's pacing is uneven, especially in the middle sections, where Hanalei and Sam’s journeys become repetitive and meandering. Throughout much of the narrative, the stakes feel low, leading to a loss of focus. This issue is further exacerbated by the audiobook format; although the narrator performs competently, they fail to bring the emotional depth of the story to life as vividly as intended.",
            "Hanalei and Sam are endearing characters, but their personal journeys and budding romance lack depth. Hanalei's exile and her resolve to return home held promise for emotional richness, yet this was often overshadowed by the central quest for the dragonfruit. Similarly, Sam's challenges—his complex role in Tamarind's matriarchal structure and his attempts to save his mother—were intriguing but ultimately fell short of the nuance needed to create a lasting impact.",
            "The imaginative world-building features seadragons and the mythical Nominomi Sea, providing a vibrant and captivating backdrop. Skillfully weaving in themes from Pacific Island folklore offers a fresh perspective for fantasy readers. However, the world often feels like a mere sketch rather than a fully realized landscape. While details about Tamarind’s society, dragonfruit, and seadragons are intriguing, they lack the depth needed for a truly immersive experience.",

            "Initially, I rated the first 55% of the book 4 stars, as the plot started strong. However, it soon veered in too many directions, making it difficult to follow. Many plot points felt rushed, and the resolution lacked depth. An additional 100 pages could have enhanced tension, stakes, and character development. Ultimately, the ending felt hurried, and the resolution failed to deliver emotional impact. While some reveals were surprising, the overall conclusion left me underwhelmed.",
            "I found Hanalei and Sam to be charming and easy to root for. While some side characters were intriguing, they felt underutilized and served mainly as plot devices.

The romance was subtle and not rushed; characters acknowledged their feelings but prioritized other matters, which I appreciated.",

The romantic relationship between Hanalei and Sam comes across as forced, with minimal chemistry, relying more on past events for their development rather than showcasing their growth in the present.",

Conversely, the ending felt rushed, offering an overly convenient resolution to the characters' conflicts. The narrative would have benefited from a longer format—ideally a duology or trilogy—to fully explore its themes and characters. Additionally, the villains, although fitting, received minimal page time, further underscoring the need for a more expansive story.",
            "While not marketed as a romance, the evolving feelings between the two main characters stem from their shared upbringing and the curse linking Hanalei to Sam's mother. However, I found the romantic aspect underdeveloped and craved greater character depth, particularly for Hanalei, who came across as somewhat one-dimensional. Additionally, I wanted to see more background on the relationship between her and Sam.",

I also wanted more background between her and Sam.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven—it was both too slow and too fast. The middle really dragged, though I understand why the author chose these scenes since the story needed them to progress.  \n   - The ending was rushed with an extremely convenient fix for everyone's troubles.  \n   - The story should've been longer, or at least a duology, but ultimately probably a trilogy or series to fully explore its material.  \n\n- **Villains and Conflict:**  \n   - The villains were appropriate, but they were barely on page. This is one of the reasons I think the story should've been longer or made into a series.  \n\n- **Content Warnings (Animal Abuse):**  \n   - There is a lot of animal abuse in this book. The final instance at the end really wasn't necessary. It was gut-wrenching because I loved the character, but it felt like it was included solely for shock value.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I liked the characters overall, and the story had so much potential.  \n   - I would recommend this book if you like seadragons, pirates, and South Pacific culture/myths, but I would also caution readers about the animal abuse and the pacing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in its rich mythology, imaginative world-building, and unique elements like seadragons and magical tattoos, it falls short in pacing, character development, and unnecessary content like animal abuse.

The characters felt underdeveloped, the pacing was rushed, and the romance lacked depth. Despite these flaws, it’s still worth a read, especially for fans of Lucier’s work.

I found the execution lacking in depth and detail, leaving me wanting more. Key plot twists—such as Captain B’s return, Hanalei receiving a sea dragon marking, the connection to the Gods, and the awakening of the Princess—were predictable. While predictability isn't inherently negative, it certainly reduced the impact of these moments.",

However, several conflicts are resolved too swiftly, lacking the necessary sense of urgency. While the story begins with a vibrant, carefree tone, it takes a sharp, brutal turn in the final 20 percent, creating a jarring yet intensifying shift in the narrative.",

While the characters and their relationships hold promise, they could have been more deeply explored to elevate the emotional stakes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, these ideas were only introduced and never explored in depth. It felt like hearing the beginning of a beautiful song but never getting to hear the rest or learn its name.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n   - The story was highly predictable. I made predictions while reading, such as the Anemone being The Compass Rose and Jejomar being the one who took the missing dragon egg, and both turned out to be correct.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I appreciated the dual POV, but the connection between Hana and Sam felt unconvincing. While they knew each other as children and are both attractive, their falling in love over maybe three days didn’t feel believable to me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n   - Despite its flaws, *Dragonfruit* was still a good read.

It was unique and immersive, adding a fresh feel to the young adult fantasy genre.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the story was intriguing and well-integrated into the world-building. It added depth to the narrative and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Some of the supporting characters were well-developed and memorable. They added richness to the story and complemented the main plot effectively.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt inconsistent. At times, it leaned more toward a young adult tone, while at other times, it seemed more suited for a middle-grade audience. This inconsistency made the narrative feel uneven.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  The pacing was problematic. The narrative often skipped over scenes that deserved more attention and instead focused on relatively mundane details that didn’t contribute much to advancing the plot. This made the story feel disjointed at times.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was very, very light. It didn’t play a significant role in the story, which might appeal to readers who prefer minimal romantic subplots.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this young adult fantasy novel has a captivating setting, an interesting magic system, and some strong supporting characters. However, the inconsistent writing style and uneven pacing detract from the overall experience. The light romance is a minor element, which may or may not appeal to readers depending on their preferences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It’s like \"Moana but with dragons,\" and it’s executed beautifully.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Hanalei is my favorite character—she’s so precious and must be protected at all costs. Her portrayal is one of the highlights of the book.\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  While I enjoyed the story, I found the prose to be relatively dull and clunky at times. It didn’t always flow as smoothly as I would have liked.\n\n- **Pacing and Depth:**  \n  I struggled with the pacing and depth of the story. At times, it felt rushed or lacking in complexity. That said, I recognize that I’m no longer the target demographic, so this might not be an issue for younger readers.\n\n- **Potential for Expansion:**  \n  This book would have been perfect as a multi-book series. Honestly, it needed at least three to six books to fully explore its world and characters. I’m genuinely sad it’s a standalone because the story had so much potential to be expanded into something truly golden.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its authentic YA feel, strong cultural representation, and lovable characters like Hanalei. However, the pacing, depth, and prose could have been stronger, and I believe the story would have thrived as a series rather than a standalone. Despite its flaws, it’s a refreshing and meaningful read, especially for younger teens.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

While the cultural elements were present, they were the only highlight for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt bland and lacked depth, which made it difficult for me to connect with them or care about their journeys.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The setting was underdeveloped, and the world-building came across as flat.

It’s a fun read, especially for younger audiences, but these shortcomings impacted my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars (docked one star for incomplete execution and another for underdeveloped characters)."

            "The pacing of the story is remarkably consistent, showcasing the author's talent for creating engaging standalone novels. However, the book feels somewhat short, leaving certain elements underdeveloped. The romance particularly suffers, as the tension is assumed rather than developed, which diminishes its impact. Additionally, some side conflicts feel rushed, with characters acknowledging odd behaviors, but the narrative quickly moves past them. While the plot remains contained and veers away from cliched conflicts, it emphasizes themes of community, responsibility, and history. Although some readers may find this approach unrealistic, I appreciated its uniqueness. Unfortunately, the ending falters for me, marked by a moment that feels unexpectedly brutal and out of place. This scene comes off as gratuitous and disconcerting, contrasting sharply with the story's generally positive tone. As a result, I find myself hesitant to revisit the book, despite enjoying most of it.",
            "Haliendi and Samahtitamahenele are compelling protagonists who confront significant challenges. Their strong sense of history and friendship is expertly developed, making their chemistry palpable. I appreciated the opportunity to see both of their perspectives.",
            "The Pacific Island-inspired fantasy world is vibrant and immersive, filled with broader tensions that bring it to life. I can easily envision a future for these characters. The light, simple magical elements introduce an enjoyable twist to the story, and I particularly appreciated the concept of the magic markings. However, some rules governing the magic were inconsistently applied, especially regarding one character's conclusion."

While I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of the story, the underdeveloped elements, rushed conflicts, and a jarringly brutal moment in the ending detracted from my overall experience. Despite these flaws, it remains a captivating read that showcases the author’s talent for crafting immersive, standalone fantasies.",

            "The story follows Hanalei, whose father stole a dragon egg destined to save a queen, resulting in their exile. Over the course of ten years, she navigates various lives—serving a cruel dragoneer, studying seadragons, and teaching at a school. Ultimately, she returns home to confront her past and seek redemption. The concept of dragonfruit serving as dragon eggs and the surrounding lore were captivating. Additionally, the notion that every wish comes with a price added significant depth to the narrative. The realistic yet troubling depiction of the hunt for seadragons and their eggs was particularly impactful.",

I appreciated that the story doesn’t center heavily on romance, allowing the fantasy elements to truly take center stage.",

            "The plot lacked urgency and high stakes, resulting in a less gripping experience. The introduction of child hostages late in the story felt forced and failed to evoke any emotional connection. While the book was entertaining, it didn’t compel me to keep reading; it was enjoyable yet forgettable. The narrative needed more space to fully develop its characters and plot points. It either had too many characters for its length or was laying the groundwork for future developments. Although I generally prefer brevity, this story would have benefitted from a longer format to allow for deeper exploration of its elements.",

The setting, inspired by Pacific/Hawaiian mythology, is unique and well-crafted, creating an immersive experience. The creative magical system, particularly the idea of animal markings that move and can become corporeal, adds a memorable and innovative touch."

The lack of urgency and stakes made the story less gripping, though it remained entertaining throughout.

The setting and magical system stood out as particularly creative.\n   - The Pacific/Hawaiian mythology and setting were unique and well-executed, making the world feel fresh and immersive.\n   - The idea of animal markings that move and can become corporeal was especially memorable and innovative.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**\n   - The book felt like it needed more length to fully develop its characters and plot points. It either had too many characters for its size or seemed to be setting up a potential series.\n   - While I usually prefer brevity, I believe this story would have benefited from being longer to allow for deeper exploration of its elements.\n\n- **Plot and Stakes:**\n   - The plot lacked a sense of urgency or high stakes, which made it less gripping. The introduction of children as hostages toward the end felt forced and ineffective because the reader had no emotional connection to them.\n   - The story was entertaining but not the type of book I felt compelled to keep reading. It was enjoyable but not unforgettable.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters and their relationships could have been fleshed out more thoroughly. The book felt like it either had too many characters or was setting up for a series, which detracted from the depth of individual characters.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book was a good read overall, particularly for fans of fantasy with unique settings and mythology. However, it didn’t leave a lasting impression on me beyond its world-building and magical elements.\n   - While I wouldn’t rule out reading a sequel, it wasn’t a book I was eager to pick up or reluctant to put down. It was simply a solid, enjoyable read.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel offers a creative and original world with a unique magical system and setting inspired by Pacific/Hawaiian mythology.

She reminded me of Cressida from *Bridgerton*.  \n  - SAM !!!! <3  \n\n- **Pacing and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - Some of the pacing felt off.  \n  - One of the character deaths GUTTED ME.  \n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  - \"Rescue now. Love later\" lol  \n  - \"Do not apologize for your place in this world. We are where the gods wish us to be.\"  \n  - \"We are defined by our hardships, Hanaleiarihi, and how we face them. We are made stronger or weaker by those we hold closest to us.\"  \n  - \"The cure for worry was action. The same could be said about grief.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dragonfruit* is a powerful and culturally rich novel that celebrates Pasifika heritage while delivering a compelling fantasy story. Despite some pacing issues, the book excels in its representation, world-building, and emotional depth, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance, which was heavily marketed, felt underdeveloped, with the childhood friends-to-lovers dynamic lacking progression until the very end. Introducing more tension or distance between the main character and Sam, particularly around her deception about being dead, would have added depth to their relationship. Conflicts resolved too quickly contributed to a rushed feel overall. Additionally, a significant character death seemed unnecessary and poorly executed; if it had to occur, it could have been more impactful, perhaps through a self-sacrifice or a later reappearance. The book also felt too brief, with a large font making it appear to be a 200-page read despite exceeding 300 pages. The rapid pacing could have benefited from a duology format, allowing for greater exploration of the story. Starting earlier, especially with the main character's backstory and experiences at the school, would have made the narrative more well-rounded.",
            "The protagonist's exile appears to be largely self-imposed rather than solely a consequence of her father's actions, which feels inconsistent with the book's portrayal. Upon her return, there is a noticeable absence of emotional turmoil or conflict, rendering her lengthy absence seem unjustified. A deeper exploration of her role as a marine biologist and her connection to wildlife would have significantly enriched the narrative.",
            "The magic system was intriguing yet underutilized. A deeper exploration of why the magic only works on the island would have added depth, as the concept held great potential that ultimately felt unfulfilled, leaving me wanting more."

Growing up as an orphan, she becomes a seadragon researcher and reunites with her childhood friend, Prince Sam, to find a Dragonfruit that can awaken his mother, the Princess, from a magical coma. While the plot is straightforward and packed with adventure, dragons, and magic, which I enjoyed, I wished for greater complexity and more detailed worldbuilding.",
            "Hanalei is an admirable protagonist—brave, clever, and deeply connected to nature. Her heartwarming friendship and budding romance with Prince Sam, a loyal and courageous young man, create a lovely dynamic. The presence of side characters, particularly the sinister Dragoners who kill Seadragons, enriches the story with depth and intriguing subplots.",

            "The Pacific Island setting and culture provide a stunning backdrop for the story. The vivid descriptions of the seadragons allow them to come to life in the reader's imagination, and their unique personalities enhance the narrative. The magic system is particularly inventive, especially the idea of animal familiars tattooed on characters' bodies, which can transform in magical ways—such as multiplying or growing larger. Fetu, the fruit bat familiar, and a comically grumpy spider familiar are delightful additions that bring charm and humor to the tale."

By the end of the book, Rosamie emerged as one of my favorites. The female main character (FMC) is strong and proactive, facing her challenges with grace rather than bitterness or cruelty, even when it would have been justified. My main issue was the minimal romance; despite being marketed as a romantic fantasy, the romantic elements were scarce. The narrative was strong enough that it didn’t require the limited romance present. It would have been preferable for it not to be labeled as a romantic fantasy to avoid potential disappointment.",

The book was marketed as a romantic fantasy, but the romance was minimal.\n   - The book was so good that it didn’t need the little romance it had. It would have been better not to market it as a romantic fantasy to avoid disappointment.\n\n- **Themes and Inspiration:**\n   - The book is steeped in Pacific Island mythology, adventure, and dragons, which I found refreshing and captivating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a breathtaking fantasy novel with excellent world-building, compelling characters, and a richly imagined setting. While the romance was underwhelming and misaligned with the marketing, the story itself was so strong that it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. I highly recommend it to fans of mythology, adventure, and dragons.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The pacing of the story could have been tighter, and some plotlines felt underdeveloped, which diminished the overall experience. With better resolution of certain arcs and improved pacing, this book could have received a higher rating. The narrative follows Hanalei, who returns to her island home after escaping a seadragon hunter. She reunites with her childhood friend, Prince Sam, and agrees to help him find the Dragonfruit, a magical item that can undo a person’s greatest sorrow at a steep price, in hopes of reviving his comatose mother. This book offers a refreshing take on fantasy, shifting the focus from traditional knights and flying dragons to warriors and seadragons. Themes of adventure and self-discovery are central, while romantic elements remain secondary.",
            "Hanalei is a relatable protagonist whose motivations remain somewhat unexplored until later in the story, ultimately lacking the depth that could enrich her character. In contrast, Prince Sam's quest to save his mother brings significant emotional weight to the narrative.",

There are plenty of opportunities to explore the world further.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - There were some issues with the inconsistency of pacing, which felt similar to most YA books coming out lately. I think with another 50 or so pages, the pacing issues could have been improved.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  - The magic system could have used more elaboration, but it works as it currently stands.

I think it could be a challenging text for a younger YA reader but serves as a great introduction to fantasy, mythology, and light romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and a desire for more elaboration on the magic system, Dragonfruit is a brilliant and delightful read.

            "The story centers on the taboo of consuming a dragon egg, known as Dragonfruit, which grants wishes at a steep price. The moral dilemma of whether to use the Dragonfruit propels the narrative, though the outcome feels predictable, as it's clear the protagonists won't kill an unborn dragon. The unsettling consequences of a wish gone awry add a chilling layer to the tale. The gripping first and final acts are hard to put down, but the second act falters with slower character development and diminished plot momentum.",
            "The characters are the book's weakest element. The main antagonist stands out as the most relatable, while the protagonists lack distinct personalities. Sam becomes vengeful when his loved ones are threatened, Hanalei opposes killing dragons, and Rosamie has a bit more depth, but these traits are only glimpsed in a few scenes. The love triangle involving Sam, Hanalei, and Rosamie feels underdeveloped and takes a backseat to the main plot.",
            "The world is richly detailed, showcasing everything from high-class fashion to bustling workhouses. It delves into the intricate connections and rivalries between islands, subtly hinting at the looming threat of colonialism. Dragons are pivotal to both the ecosystem and economy, portrayed as intelligent water predators whose byproducts, such as fat and scales, hold significant value—paralleling the role of whales in our world. Additionally, the concept of living tattoos—magical creatures that bond with individuals—enhances the world’s uniqueness."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book excels in world-building and presents an intriguing premise with moral dilemmas, it falls short in character development and pacing in the middle section. The predictable resolution to the central conflict and underdeveloped protagonists detract from the overall experience. However, the immersive world and engaging start and finish make it a worthwhile read.",

The main antagonist is the most personable, while the protagonists lack distinct personalities.  \n   - Sam is bloodthirsty when his loved ones are hurt, Hanalei is against killing dragons, and Rosamie is slightly more layered, but these traits are only shown in a few scenes.  \n   - The love triangle between Sam, Hanalei, and Rosamie is underdeveloped and remains in the background compared to the main plot.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The first and final acts are gripping and hard to put down.  \n   - The second act lags, with slower character development and less momentum in the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in world-building and presents an intriguing premise with moral dilemmas, it falls short in character development and pacing in the middle section.

The vibrant cover art also stood out as unique and fitting for the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**\n   - The story starts with a bang and maintains a fast pace throughout, with no significant lulls. The world-building, including the history of dragon hunters, dragons, and dragonfruit, is seamlessly integrated during breaks in the action.\n\n- **Character Development (Hanalei):**\n   - Hanalei’s character is well-developed, with a compelling backstory tied to dragonfruit. She is both saved and estranged by it, losing her family, friends, and home. Her complex feelings toward dragons and dragonfruit add depth to her character, especially her understanding of the cost borne by both humans and dragons.\n\n- **Depiction of Dragons:**\n   - The dragons are portrayed as majestic yet wild animals, embodying both the beauty and horror of nature. The book doesn’t shy away from the human cost of living alongside such powerful predators, which adds a layer of tragedy to the story.\n\n- **Tone and Themes:**\n   - The story balances a cozy YA fantasy tone with darker, tragic elements. The romance between Hanalei and Sam is sweet and innocent, but the violence toward dragons and the moral dilemmas surrounding dragonfruit create a poignant contrast. The book handles these themes with care, though it may be difficult for readers sensitive to animal violence.\n\n- **Moral Complexity:**\n   - I appreciated the author’s approach to presenting the moral dilemmas of dragonfruit without overtly moralizing. However, I felt the story could have benefited from more explicit conversations between characters about the ethics of using dragonfruit, as this would have added depth to the resolution.\n\n- **Villains and Supporting Characters:**\n   - Some villains felt cartoonish, especially in the beginning, which detracted from their depth. While one villain had an interesting arc, it was somewhat predictable. I wished for more nuanced development of these characters by the end.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - I thoroughly enjoyed the book, finishing it in two sittings. The main characters were relatable, and their romance was heartwarming. The dragons were a highlight, adding a fresh and integral element to the story.

            "The story is well-structured and paced, though some events can feel contrived in their efforts to advance the plot. However, it successfully distinguishes itself from *Moana*, which is a refreshing aspect.",
            "Hanalei and Sam are intricately developed characters, with their relationship transitioning seamlessly from childhood friends to romance, avoiding any sense of artificiality. Even when navigating familiar tropes, such as the exile returning home or the prince compelled to marry for his kingdom, they maintain depth rather than feeling like clichés. The supporting characters are well-rounded and realistically flawed, adding to the story's relatability and engagement. Although the villain is somewhat one-dimensional, this does not significantly diminish the overall enjoyment of the narrative.",
            "The representation of Pacific Islanders in this story is a standout feature, providing a fresh perspective in fantasy fiction. The fantasy world, inspired by Pacific Island culture, feels both authentic and unique.",
            "*Year of the Reaper* stands out as a refreshing entry in the YA fantasy genre, which often relies on recycled plots and tropes. The worldbuilding is not only solid but also captivating, drawing inspiration from Pacific Island mythology and culture instead of the typical medieval European backdrop. Unique elements, such as dragonfruits and markings that manifest as animal companions, enrich the narrative with depth and originality."

        "conclusion": "*Year of the Reaper* is a highly enjoyable and unique fantasy novel that stands out for its originality, solid worldbuilding, and well-developed characters. The Pacific Islander-inspired setting and mythology add a fresh and authentic layer to the story, making it a memorable read. While the plot has a few contrived moments and the villain is somewhat one-dimensional, these are minor flaws in an otherwise engaging and well-crafted narrative.

            "The book provided a quick and refreshing break after the weighty *The Way of Kings*. Each 100 pages felt impactful, delivering a meaningful portion of the story rather than just a minor segment.",
            "The characters are well-developed and convincingly real, which adds depth to the story. Witnessing Rosamie’s growth is particularly heartwarming, while Jejomar’s gradual development, though slow, makes him relatable and authentic. Even the minor characters are fully realized, contributing to the overall narrative. The friendship between Rosamie and Hanalei stands out, adding emotional depth to the plot. However, the romance feels underdeveloped; the attraction among characters appears based on superficial qualities—such as physical attractiveness and positive traits—rather than deeper emotional connections or insights into their thoughts about one another.",
            "This book features a fluid and engaging writing style that makes it both accessible and enjoyable. The short chapters effectively maintain a brisk pace, while the lighthearted YA tone persists even as the narrative matures into darker themes toward the end. The story is rich with depth, drawing me in and making me genuinely care about the characters and their struggles.",

            "This story is a captivating blend of action, adventure, and exploration that kept me fully engaged from start to finish. The pacing is generally effective, though the ending feels somewhat rushed and abrupt. The novel fits nicely into both Reddit Fantasy's 2024 Bingo Square \"Entitled Animals\" (hard mode) and a food-themed bingo card, with the Dragonfruit—an egg with legendary properties—playing a central role. Consuming this Dragonfruit is said to alleviate one’s greatest sorrow. The protagonist, Hanalei, owes her life to it; her father stole the Dragonfruit to save her from a poisoned soup, resulting in his tragic disappearance and death. The narrative features multiple characters, including Captain Bragadin and Prince Sam, each pursuing the Dragonfruit for their own desperate reasons, which heightens the stakes. It explores the ethical dilemma of humans hunting dragons for their eggs, posing a significant threat to the species' survival, while also exposing human selfishness.",
            "The story explores the characters' profound insecurities, guilt, and the challenge of reconciling their desires with their sense of duty. Hanalei's journey as an exile, culminating in emotional catharsis, is both compelling and satisfying. The well-developed motivations and conflicts of the characters enhance the depth of the narrative.",

However, the unnecessary character death and slightly rushed ending kept it from being a 5-star read for me. It’s a great choice for younger readers and fans of low-stakes YA Fantasy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (instead of 5 due to the character death)."

            "The story expertly maintains tension and unpredictability, leaving readers unsure of its conclusion. The moral dilemma surrounding the dragon fruit raises the stakes and keeps the resolution in doubt. Centered on Hanalei and Sam’s quest to obtain a dragon fruit—symbolized as a dragon egg—to save Sam's mother, the princess and future ruler, the narrative explores themes of redemption, sacrifice, and moral conflict, as the dragon fruit comes with a price. The plot is propelled by the urgency to save Sam's mom and the tension between Hanalei's desire to assist Sam and her concerns about the potential consequences.",
            "Hanalei and Sam are well-developed characters with clear motivations that propel the plot forward. While their character arcs may not showcase significant development, their strong characterization compensates for it. Hanalei's internal conflict—torn between saving the princess and protecting the baby dragon—adds emotional depth to the story.",
            "The dragons play a crucial role in the islanders' world and culture, acting as both a resource and a source of fear. Hanalei's dual role as a dragon scholar and hunter adds depth to the world-building. Although the setting is enhanced by intriguing elements like the marks, other kingdoms, and trade, I longed for a deeper exploration of these facets. The book's introduction of Pacific Islander culture and mythology was refreshing and inspiring, igniting my interest in delving into more Pacific Islander literature.",
            "This book is an ideal beach read for the 2024 season, offering a refreshing and fun tone. With its themes of adventure, redemption, and choices, it promises an engaging summer experience."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a delightful and engaging adventure with a unique blend of Pacific Islander culture, dragons, and moral dilemmas. While the plot-driven narrative and well-rounded characters keep the story moving, the world-building could have been further enriched with more detail. Overall, it’s a perfect summer read that leaves a lasting impression.",

            "The central plot focuses on the quest for a sea dragon egg, which is engaging but ultimately lacks substantial action and adventure. The narrative primarily unfolds on the island and its surrounding cove, which feels restrictive. I would have preferred more sailing and oceanic escapades to enhance the experience.",
            "Hanalei and Sam share a sweet, well-developed relationship marked by a strong protective dynamic and deep connection. Hanalei's character growth is particularly compelling, highlighting her journey of self-discovery and her understanding of her impact on the world.",
            "*Dragonfruit* features beautifully crafted world-building that is immersive without being overwhelming. A standout aspect is its incorporation of Pacific Islander culture, showcasing rich details such as tapa cloth, pavilions, and traditional foods. The concept of guardian spirit animal tattoos adds an intriguing magical element; however, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of the symbolism behind specific tattoos, such as those representing chiefs, women, and prevalent motifs.",
            "The author specializes in low fantasy novels that incorporate romance subplots. Her stories evoke a cozy feel, peppered with occasional triggering elements and some instances of death, but they never become overly intense. While they aren't epic fantasies—with their absence of rapid twists, expansive world-building, or high-stakes conflicts—they excel in the YA fantasy genre. The emphasis remains on character development and engaging mystery plots."

Jejomar's resolution, becoming a handsome prince as punishment, contradicted the established theme that every wish has a price. Additionally, the moral suggesting that you can't choose your family conflicted with the notion that family is rooted in love rather than blood. The mother's restoration also felt oddly insignificant, receiving little attention after the event.

The egg was meant to heal the princess, and in the years since, Hanalei has become a researcher of sea-dragons. When a dragon hunter captures her to track down a pregnant sea-dragon, Hanalei embarks on an adventure that helps her find a new purpose.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building is exceptional, set in an archipelago where we get to explore both the sea and island life. The sea-dragons are ferocious yet fascinating creatures, and their lives and habits are richly detailed. The culture of Tamarind, a matriarchal society, is intriguing, especially the magical tattoos that can emerge from the body and act as companions.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Hanalei is a compelling protagonist, and I appreciated that she isn’t blamed for her father’s choices. Her friendships with other women on the island are heartwarming and well-developed. The romance is light and satisfying, with a resolution that feels gratifying.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book explores themes of consequences, redemption, and purpose. There are brutal scenes involving the hunting of sea-dragons and some deaths that are emotionally impactful. The consequences of using dragonfruit are haunting, but these elements add a layer of realism to the fantasy world. Despite the darker moments, the overall tone is positive, and the ending is uplifting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully crafted young adult fantasy with rich world-building, compelling characters, and a story that balances adventure, emotion, and cultural depth. I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy immersive fantasy with a unique mythological inspiration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating is mentioned, but the reviewer expresses strong enthusiasm and a high recommendation for the book."

            "The story is well-paced for a standalone novel, but certain events occur out of convenience and feel abrupt, suggesting the author struggled with the discovery aspects. Additionally, the random time jumps back to past events often feel like the main character is zoning out, which requires some adjustment from the reader.",
            "The characters were relatable and easy to empathize with, but I wished for a deeper connection. Hanalei's beautiful life was tragically cut short, yet I admired her resilience and positivity. The chemistry among the main characters was enjoyable, giving the story a subtle friends-to-strangers-to-lovers arc. While some character dynamics were well-developed, others felt lacking.",

Everything felt vibrant and magical, and there was such a strong cultural identity woven into this story. The lore and magic were beautiful and unique.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The characters were simple and easy to empathize with, but I didn’t feel like I could connect to them as much as I wanted to. Hanalei had a beautiful life cut short by multiple tragedies, and I admired how she remained clever and positive despite everything. The chemistry between the main characters was enjoyable—I would almost consider this a friends-to-strangers-to-lovers story if I looked hard enough. Some character connections were very good, while others felt flat.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was paced fairly well for a standalone novel, though a lot of things happened out of convenience or so suddenly that it felt like the author wasn’t sure how to handle the discovery, so it was just handed to readers. There were also some time jumps that showed past events, but they were random and felt almost like the main character was zoning out, which took some getting used to.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  There were a few more instances of telling-not-showing than I cared for, but otherwise, the writing was emotional and interesting. I particularly loved the sea dragons—I’m a sucker for dragon lore—and everything came to a very neat end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging and magical story with a strong cultural identity and unique lore.

            "While the romance in this story is minimal—barely existing—it doesn’t detract from the overall experience. However, it’s worth noting that it shouldn't have been marketed as a romance. The lack of romance feels appropriate, as the narrative instead celebrates friendship and loyalty, which can be just as beautiful. Don't let the absence of romance deter you; this is a captivating adventure filled with lovable characters and emotionally resonant moments.",
            "As a YA/Jr. High School read, *Dragonfruit* unfortunately tends to tell rather than show, merely scratching the surface of its intriguing world. It would have been fascinating to witness the characters' transformations or delve deeper into the lore of the enchanted tattoos. What secrets lie beyond Samahtitamahenele and Hanalei's Tamarind village, and what rich history and dragons are hidden in the Nominomi Sea?",
            "A delightful and adventurous read! If you're in search of a fun, breezy summer book, *Dragonfruit* is an excellent choice. This unique gem stands out in a genre that deserves more attention. With its dragons, oceanic adventures, a touch of piracy, and rich tropical themes and cultures, this light read is sure to captivate fans of whimsical stories."

        "conclusion": "Dragonfruit is a refreshing and adventurous summer read that delivers a fun, lighthearted experience with lovable characters and emotional moments. While it had the potential to be spectacular, it falls short in fully exploring its world-building, character depth, and magic system, often resorting to telling rather than showing. The lack of romance, though not a dealbreaker, was misleading given its marketing as a romantascy. Despite these shortcomings, the story shines as a unique tale of friendship and loyalty, set in a vibrant tropical world filled with dragons, pirates, and oceanic themes. It’s a peculiar gem that stands out in its genre, and I hope to see more stories like it in the future.",

            "The novel is fast-paced, allowing me to read it in just two sittings. The story captivated me almost immediately, though some events felt rushed and lacked a proper climax. Certain plot points appeared overly convenient, and the narrative could benefit from more depth. For instance, a confusing scene where Hana witnesses a woman being chopped in half by a seadragon but later finds her alive remains unexplained, leaving an unresolved loose end. Additionally, the foreshadowing was too obvious, making some plot twists predictable.",

The world-building and atmosphere were commendable, but the pacing felt off. Major events often unfolded too quickly, sometimes resolved within just two chapters—like climbing a mountain without ever reaching its peak. The highlight was Hanalei getting her seadragon tattoo, which caught me by surprise. However, Brigomar's death was rushed, mentioned in just a few sentences. The conclusion felt crammed into the last 5% of the book, rendering the middle vague and lackluster, as it primarily revolved around harpooning seadragons, killing, and searching for an egg.",

The premise is imaginative and magical, offering a refreshing escape from darker, more depressing reads.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows Hanalei, who is captured while documenting seadragons and forced into a grand and terrible adventure with desperate, greedy men. The plot is engaging and mostly well-paced, though there are moments where I wished it slowed down to allow characters to process their experiences more deeply.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The two main characters are well-drawn and likable. Their development kept me invested throughout the story, and I was never bored.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel explores themes of greed, loss, and the consequences of seeking magical solutions. It includes horrifying and painful moments, a slight thread of romance, and a ton of heartbreak. Readers should prepare for an emotional journey.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The story contains significant animal and child endangerment, actual animal death cries, and parental death. These elements are intense and may be distressing for some readers, but they are integral to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Dragonfruit* is an imaginative and magical novel that serves as a great palate cleanser for readers tired of dark, depressing books. Despite its intense and heartbreaking moments, the well-drawn characters and engaging plot make it a compelling read. However, readers should be aware of the heavy content warnings before diving in.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the story features an engaging narrative, it encounters slight pacing issues in the final fifty pages, where the resolution of various plot threads feels rushed. Additionally, some character problem solutions come across as overly convenient, leading to an ending that wraps up a bit too neatly.",
            "The novel offers a diverse array of characters, but the protagonists, Hanalei and Sam, come across as somewhat flat compared to the supporting cast. Their character arcs appear to have been fully realized before the story begins, leaving us to witness only the culmination of their development. Most of their growth is centered on their relationship, which would be effective if the story were strictly a romance.",
            "*Dragonfruit* presents a rich and vibrant world, where lore, traditions, and myths intertwine seamlessly throughout the narrative. The stunning descriptions, particularly of the dragons, create a captivating atmosphere. A memorable scene in the middle of the book, marked by its poignant imagery and focus on the strength of community, showcases the careful craftsmanship and attention to detail that define this immersive world.",
            "*Dragonfruit* distinguishes itself by steering clear of the conventional fantasy trope of saving the world from a grand evil. Instead, it delves into personal stakes, showcasing characters who hold onto their wishes and are motivated by the desire to protect their loved ones. This intimacy gives the story a unique and compelling quality."

The descriptions, especially of the dragons, are beautiful and immersive. A particular scene in the middle of the book, with its gut-wrenching descriptions and emphasis on the power of community, solidified how well-crafted and lovingly detailed this world is.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The novel features a wide variety of characters, but the protagonists, Hanalei and Sam, felt a bit flat compared to the supporting cast. This is likely because their character arcs seem to have occurred before the story begins, and we’re seeing the results of that development now. Most of their growth is in their relationship with each other, which works well if the story were strictly a romance novel.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Resolution:**  \n  There are slight pacing issues, particularly in the last fifty pages, where the story feels rushed as it ties up numerous loose ends. Some solutions to the characters' problems felt too convenient, and the ending wraps up a little too neatly.  \n\n- **Themes and Stakes:**  \n  The story avoids the typical fantasy trope of saving the world from a major evil. Instead, it focuses on personal stakes—characters who believe in wishes and are driven by the desire to save their loved ones. This personability makes *Dragonfruit* stand out and feel special.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and the protagonists feeling underdeveloped compared to the supporting cast, *Dragonfruit* is a thoroughly enjoyable read.

            "The pacing of the story was uneven, with some sections rushing through important moments. This left certain climactic scenes feeling anticlimactic, as they resolved too quickly and lacked the depth and tension I craved. The ending, especially the confrontation with the villain, felt rushed and would have benefited from a more prolonged and developed resolution.",
            "I found Sam intriguing, but the lack of character development diminished my connection to him. In contrast, I thoroughly enjoyed Fetu's character, which felt much more engaging. The romance between the main characters came across as underdeveloped, with insufficient tension and a reliance on the assumption that childhood feelings endured over a decade without adequate exploration. However, the romance is subtle enough that it may not detract from the experience for readers who are not particularly interested in romantic subplots.",
            "*Dragonfruit* offers an intriguing and unique concept centered around sea dragons. The rarity and magic of the sea dragon eggs, known as dragonfruit, add an exciting depth to the narrative. Additionally, the magical marking tattoos are a standout feature that I particularly enjoyed."

        "conclusion": "While *Dragonfruit* has some pacing issues, underdeveloped characters, and a rushed ending, its unique concept, magical elements, and standout aspects like the dragonfruit and magical tattoos make it a worthwhile read. The mild romance may not appeal to everyone, but it doesn’t overshadow the story’s strengths. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for its originality.",

            "This engaging young adult novel follows a girl who, after losing her family and homeland, becomes a dragoner—commercial dragon hunter—aboard a sailing vessel. It delves into themes of respect and love for animals versus exploitation and dominance, echoing other works that tackle similar issues. Additionally, the story features clever twists, such as a unique approach to dragon reproduction, where males carry eggs in a marsupial-like pouch instead of hiding them onshore.",
            "The romance between Hanalei and Sam is evident from the outset, making it somewhat predictable, though it clearly caters to YA readers. Additionally, a subtle, fleeting romance between two adults unfolds through winks and secret gestures, adding an intriguing layer without overshadowing the main narrative.",
            "In this captivating tale set in the vibrant region of Tamarind, the author crafts an imaginative world filled with unique history and mythology. One particularly intriguing element is the concept of magic conveyed through inherited tattoos. For instance, Sam's bat tattoo, Fetu, serves as a messenger, while Isko evolves from a shark tattoo to a stunning sea dragon tattoo, the most striking of them all.",

It explores themes of respect and love for animals versus exploitation and dominance, reminiscent of other books with similar dichotomies. The story also includes clever twists, such as the unique way dragons breed, with males carrying eggs in a marsupial-like pouch instead of hiding them on shore.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Hanalei and Sam is glaringly obvious from the start, which felt a bit too predictable for my taste but is clearly tailored for YA readers. There’s also a subtle, fleeting romance between two adults, conveyed through winks and secret nods, which adds a touch of intrigue without overshadowing the main plot.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The author creates a rich and imaginative world in the region of Tamarind, complete with inventive history and mythology. The concept of magic being passed through inherited tattoos is particularly fascinating. For example, Sam has a bat tattoo named Fetu that can carry messages, while Isko develops a shark tattoo and eventually a sea dragon tattoo, which is the coolest of all.\n\n- **Adventure and Appeal:**  \n  The story is packed with elements that make for an epic adventure: pirates, sea dragons, and magical tattoos. These components come together to create a thrilling and engaging narrative that I found highly enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA novel is a captivating blend of adventure, romance, and imaginative world-building.

I felt the relationship between the characters and their progression could have been explored much more. While I didn’t expect steamy scenes, I wished for more one-on-one moments and deeper exploration of their connection.  \n\n- **Unanswered Questions and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  Throughout the book, I had many questions that I hoped would be answered, but they weren’t. There were so many opportunities to tell a grander story. For example, I thought the mythology about the dragon eggs might be proven wrong—perhaps the baby dragon didn’t need to be killed to grant a wish, and consuming the liquid alone would suffice without consequences. However, this potential twist was never explored.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The resolution felt rushed. The ending jumped from one event to another—she’s awake, months later they’re walking on a beach, and a year later they’re going on a trip—all within the last couple of chapters. I couldn’t fully understand how the story progressed this way because there wasn’t enough detail or development to make it feel natural.  \n\n- **World-Building and Potential:**  \n  I enjoyed the book but saw so many places where it could have created a more magical and immersive world. The story had the potential to expand into a series, but it fell short of fully realizing that possibility.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Surprises:**  \n  There was only one moment in the book that truly shocked me because I didn’t see it coming. While this was a highlight, I wished for more such surprises and deeper explanations throughout the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book but felt it had significant untapped potential.

Their dynamic and the relationships in the story were engaging and well-developed.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The dragons, magical tattoos, and fantasy elements inspired by Pacific Islander mythology were fascinating and added a unique flavor to the story. However, I felt the setting and side characters lacked depth and could have benefited from more detailed research.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  The scenic, visual prose was a highlight and made for a great YA fantasy experience. It was immersive and enjoyable to read.\n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook reader was fabulous and definitely enhanced the experience. It was worth listening to.\n\n- **Genre Critique:**  \n  While the story was fun and had a lot of potential, I felt it fell short in some areas typical of YA fantasy. The lack of depth in certain aspects made me worry about the genre's future if authors don't invest more time and research into creating richer, more detailed worlds and characters.\n\n- **Editing and Potential Improvements:**  \n  I think stronger editing could have addressed some of the issues, particularly in fleshing out the setting and side characters. There’s so much potential here, but it felt like it didn’t fully deliver.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and enjoyable YA fantasy with strong characters, unique fantasy elements, and beautiful prose. However, it could have been elevated to excellence with more detailed worldbuilding and character development.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters:**  \n  I really loved the animal characters - markings and sea dragons alike. They were engaging and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  I enjoyed the plot a lot and was very satisfied with the ending. It kept me hooked and provided a fulfilling conclusion.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was hard to follow at times, and I think there are areas that can be made stronger. However, the writing is simple, which makes the book read more like a young adult novel.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  There are moments where death and dismemberment occur, but they are brief and not overly descriptive. These moments arise as realistic hazards when dealing with dangerous animals who are being threatened, hunted, and killed. While I would not prevent a child from reading this, some parents might not be comfortable with them reading it due to these elements. That said, these instances are minor and fit the realistic concerns of dealing with wild animals, even though the animals in this book are purely fictional.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some minor flaws, this is such a fun read. The engaging characters and satisfying plot make it an enjoyable experience overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a fun and engaging read with memorable animal characters and a satisfying plot. While the writing style could be improved in some areas and the content might not be suitable for all young readers, the story’s strengths outweigh its minor flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I loved the idea of dragonfruit and the markings!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story is unique and immersive, with strong world-building and interesting minor characters, it could have benefited from more development in certain areas, such as Sam's character, the relationship between Hana and Sam, and the pacing of the plot. The ending felt abrupt, but the themes and creativity, along with the clean romance, made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

While I appreciated the intriguing concepts and interesting characters, the level of death, including one particularly horrific scene, made it feel like it was caught between grimdark and YA. I understand that mythology, legend, and fairytales can be dark, but this was just not for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved how the story was based on the heroine's journey rather than the hero's. The characters were complex, and I appreciated how compromise was sought throughout the narrative. Many of the not-so-great characters weren't entirely bad, which added depth and nuance to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  The novel had many satisfying conclusions to its various plotlines. The story was well-written and engaging, with a great overall structure.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the darkness, I would recommend this book to others because it’s a great story with strong writing and compelling elements. Most people aren’t as sensitive to dark themes as I am, so they might enjoy it more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s dark tone and themes were not entirely to my liking, I loved its intriguing concepts, complex characters, and satisfying resolutions. It’s a well-written story that I would recommend to others, especially those who enjoy darker narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise revolves around the belief that finding and eating a seadragon's egg will grant a wish, which drives many characters to pursue the eggs, referred to as \"dragonfruit.\"  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved the main characters, Sam and Hanalei, who consistently struggle to do the right thing despite the challenges they face. Their moral dilemmas and growth were compelling and relatable.  \n\n- **World-Building and Imagery:**  \n  The mythical and magical seadragons were a highlight for me. The vivid descriptions of tropical islands and the enchanting seadragons left me dreaming of such a world and imagining these creatures in the water.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of adventure, morality, and fantasy. It not only entertains with its magical premise and engaging characters but also delivers a thought-provoking message about humanity's relationship with nature.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  - I loved the incorporation of Pacific Islander mythology and the concept of dragons.  \n  - The magic of the dragon eggs was fascinating and added depth to the story.  \n  - The idea of tattoos of creatures that appear at a certain age and can come alive off the skin was unique and captivating.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The storyline was easy to follow and kept me entertained throughout.  \n  - However, conflicts were resolved too quickly, often within a few pages, and hardships were mentioned in passing rather than explored in depth.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance was appropriate for a YA book, but it felt very surface-level.  \n  - The relationship was based on the assumption that \"they grew up together, so they must be in love,\" which lacked depth.  \n  - I would have preferred more growth and open discussions between the characters to make the romance more compelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The main character was extremely likeable and well-portrayed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - It was an enjoyable read, but I wish it had a bit more emotional or narrative punch to make it truly memorable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a lot of potential with its unique mythology, engaging plot, and likeable main character. However, the romance felt underdeveloped, and conflicts were resolved too quickly, leaving me wanting more depth and emotional impact. Despite these shortcomings, it was still an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting felt rich and immersive.  \n\n- **Politics and Conflict:**  \n  The novel features fascinating political dynamics, both within the island and between different nations. These elements added depth and complexity to the story.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The childhood friends-to-reunion-to-lovers trope was enjoyable. However, the transition to the lovers' phase felt a bit rushed, and their relationship development could have been more gradual.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The ending, in general, felt rushed. I would have preferred a more drawn-out conclusion to make it feel satisfying. In fact, I would love another book to expand on the ending and provide a more fulfilling resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Pacific Islander fantasy novel excels in world-building and political intrigue, creating a captivating setting. While the romance was enjoyable, its development felt rushed, and the ending left me wanting more. A sequel to extend the conclusion would be ideal.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I think it would resonate more with younger readers or those who enjoy lighter, less intricate narratives.\n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  Despite my critiques, I appreciated the author’s writing style and storytelling ability. I’m interested in exploring more of her works in the future to see how her craft evolves.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent read, but it didn’t fully meet my expectations in terms of story and character depth. However, the author shows promise, and I’m curious to see what else she has to offer.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot revolves around a quest for dragonfruit, complicated by Hanalei's sabotage, motivated by her father's tragic history. With action-packed sequences and dragon hunters reminiscent of pirates, the story maintains an engaging pace. However, the ending leans towards predictability, despite a few surprising twists. Ultimately, the novel feels abbreviated for its ambitious concept, leaving me wanting more depth in world-building and character exploration.",
