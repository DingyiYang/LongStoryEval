            "The mystery was engaging and enjoyable to unravel with the characters. However, I wished for more depth in the story. It had the potential to explore profound themes, such as a woman's struggle to find her place in an unaccepting world, but ultimately remained surface-level and failed to fully develop these ideas.",
            "Patience was a standout character; I adored her and found her to be my spirit animal. Her determination to be herself was both refreshing and relatable, especially within the context of Regency times. I also appreciated Ashley Stuart, the male main character, for his strength and respect for Patience's thoughts and intellect. However, the romance fell short. The FMC and MMC spent very little time together, and their relationship lacked development. Without a real build-up to their love, it was difficult to feel invested in their romance."

            "The story follows Patience Whitford, the adventurous middle sister living at Taywards with her younger sisters, Grace and Joy, as well as her sister Faith and her husband, Dominic Westwood. When Major Ashley Stuart, Westwood’s brother, and his colleagues arrive, they bring the excitement Patience longs for, though they are hesitant to involve her. As the group investigates a series of break-ins and vandalism, the situation becomes increasingly complex, highlighting the urgency to identify the leader behind the chaos before it’s too late.",
            "Patience Whitford is a beautiful yet meddlesome character with a strong thirst for adventure. Major Ashley Stuart, on the other hand, is cautious and tends to steer clear of the Whitford sisters, especially Patience, despite recognizing her clever ideas. The supporting cast, including Patience's sisters and a group of colleagues, enriches the story. I particularly appreciate both the human and animal characters, as they add charm and depth to the narrative.",

            "The plot featured several enjoyable twists, but I quickly identified the main mastermind, much like in the previous book. The ending felt predictable, given Patience's skills, and it seemed a bit rushed. I was also confused about the yacht; they recognized its name, and later Chum identified it as his family's, so why didn't they consult the entire unit for information? The yacht appeared to be near Taywards, yet they had no prior knowledge of its location, which felt odd.",
