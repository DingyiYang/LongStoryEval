            "This story follows Goldie and Fletcher, who feign a romantic relationship to disrupt her brother's life with Fletcher's teammate. Initially hesitant, their dynamic evolves in an entertaining and lighthearted manner. The fresh premise of a rugby romance, paired with Fletcher’s relocation to the U.S. to promote the sport after his exit from a European team, adds an enjoyable twist to the narrative.",
            "Fletcher, with his grumpy yet endearing demeanor, is a well-crafted character whose believable backstory adds depth.

            "This story features a compelling mix of rugby, sibling rivalry, fake dating, and the classic grumpy vs. sunshine dynamic. Fletcher's ambition to promote rugby in the US and Goldie's scheme to use him against her brother add intriguing layers to the plot. The absence of external drama is refreshing, allowing the focus to remain on the central relationship without unnecessary conflicts.",
            "I struggled to connect with Fletcher throughout much of the book and found it hard to see a genuine bond between him and Goldie. Their rapid transition from strangers to lovers in less than a month felt unrealistic; I could envision them as good friends, but not as a romantic couple. Although I eventually warmed up to Fletcher—a grumpy, broken man concealed behind a tough exterior—I wished some aspects of his character arc had unfolded differently. \n\nThe fake dating trope had its charm, yet the slow-burn romance didn't fully convince me. Fletcher's frustrating behavior early on, particularly his harsh treatment of Goldie, was off-putting. Although he apologized, it didn't feel sufficient. The third act left me dissatisfied, as Goldie didn’t hold Fletcher accountable, which felt unsatisfying. Additionally, Silas, Goldie’s brother, had an excessive obsession with her dating life, which felt unnecessary given that she is 28 and perfectly capable of managing herself. Lastly, the portrayal of Silas's daughter's speech—with words like “pwetty” and “fwends”—was irritating and distracting, even though I understand that's how toddlers speak.",
            "I found Silas’s daughter’s speech to be a downside in the writing.",
            "I appreciated the clever banter and humor, characteristic of the author's writing style."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book had some enjoyable elements, like the humor and banter, but the romantic connection between Fletcher and Goldie felt rushed and unconvincing. Fletcher’s character had potential, but his actions and the lack of groveling in the third act left me unsatisfied. The supporting characters and subplots had their moments but also some frustrating aspects.",

I could buy them being good friends, but in love? Ehhh.  \n   - Fletcher is a grumpy, broken man hiding under a rough exterior, and while I ended up liking him, I wish some things had happened differently.  \n\n- **Romantic Development and Chemistry:**  \n   - The fake dating trope was fun, but the slow burn-ish romance didn’t fully convince me.  \n   - Fletcher’s reaction to something around the 20% mark was off-putting—he was an asshole to Goldie, and while he apologized, it didn’t feel enough.  \n   - The third act frustrated me because Goldie didn’t make Fletcher grovel, which felt unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n   - The story includes rugby, brothers/teammate rivalry, fake dating, and grumpy x sunshine dynamics, which were interesting.  \n   - Fletcher’s determination to grow rugby in the US and Goldie’s plan to use him to get back at her brother added some intrigue.  \n   - The lack of external drama was a plus—no unnecessary conflicts outside the main relationship.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**  \n   - Silas (Goldie’s brother) being overly obsessed with her dating life was weird and unnecessary. She’s 28 and capable of handling herself.  \n   - The way Silas’s daughter’s speech was written (“pwetty,” “wike,” “fwends”) irritated me. While I understand toddlers talk like that, reading it was headache-inducing.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n   - I enjoyed the banter and humor, which is typical of Pippa Grant’s writing style.  \n   - The writing for Silas’s daughter’s speech, however, was a downside for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book had some enjoyable elements, like the humor and banter, but the romantic connection between Fletcher and Goldie felt rushed and unconvincing.

Their dynamic was a highlight for me.\n\n- **World-Building and Connections to Other Works:**  \n  This book features a lot of characters from Copper Valley, which I haven’t read yet but now feel compelled to explore. It was fun to see fan favorites from the author’s other works grace the pages.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Plans:**  \n  I really liked this book and will be diving into the author’s backlist now.

            "Goldie Collins is a former star college soccer player whose career was abruptly halted by an unexpected injury. Though she has found success as a life coach and author, she grapples with the loss of her soccer dreams and feelings of betrayal from her ex-boyfriend and former best friend. Fletcher Huxley, an aging rugby superstar, feels rejected by his old coach and seeks to revive rugby's popularity in the U.S. Both characters share a deep sensitivity and the shared experience of losing their aspirations and the camaraderie of their teams. Silas Collins, Goldie's younger brother and Fletcher’s teammate, adds a touch of annoyance with his egotistical nature, but he genuinely cares for his sister.\n\nThe enemies-to-lovers trope is skillfully portrayed as Goldie and Fletcher evolve from mutual disdain to a strong friendship and romantic connection. Their friends-with-benefits arrangement develops authentically, even as they both struggle to confront their deepening feelings for one another.",

            "The ending feels rushed, as over 300 pages of buildup are resolved in just one chapter, diminishing the overall satisfaction.",
            "The banter between Fletcher and Goldie is utterly addictive, particularly their playful exchanges that kick off around page 44. As an enemies-to-lovers duo, Fletcher—a rugby player with a striking mustache—and Goldie, a quick-witted former soccer star, evolve from tension to a sincere, heartfelt connection. The story delves into themes of self-reinvention, coping with loneliness, and discovering companionship in unexpected places. While it touches on parental loss and rejection, this aspect feels somewhat underdeveloped and lacking in depth. Friendships play a central role, with Goldie receiving genuine support from wise women who help her pursue her dreams.

It was difficult to believe they could fall deeply in love after just two weeks, especially without spending every day together. The absence of meaningful shared experiences—such as trauma, forced proximity, or a pre-existing connection—made their quick bond unconvincing.",

Her strength and likability were enhanced by her absence of pettiness. In contrast, I found the male character unappealing. He often seemed brooding, arrogant, and immature, and his lack of emotional intelligence made him difficult to connect with.",

Unfortunately, this book fell short, lacking heart-fluttering moments, emotional connections, and meaningful conversations. While the characters did engage in dialogue, it primarily focused on the MMC’s past job loss, which did little to foster a romantic bond."

            "While the story was engaging, certain elements felt unresolved. I would have appreciated closure for Goldie concerning her ex and ex-best friend, particularly after Fletcher's support. Additionally, an epilogue or update on Fletcher's relationship with his father would have been welcome. However, I recognize that, much like life, not everything concludes neatly.",
            "Goldie and Fletcher's banter was delightful, and I appreciated their competitive spirit and playful interactions. However, I struggled to fully invest in their chemistry; something felt lacking throughout the story. It wasn't until the snowball incident that I began to believe in their connection more.",
            "The moment of angst towards the end truly stood out for me, especially Fletcher's heartfelt plea for Goldie to stay. His desperation resonated deeply, as I have a soft spot for characters in turmoil.",

The trio of Odette, Sheila, and Evelyn brings a refreshing humor to every scene they grace. The infamous mustache delivers particularly hilarious moments, especially during the grocery store and cooking class scenes."

            "The story follows Fletcher, a grumpy, washed-up rugby star who relocates to the U.S. There, he encounters Goldie, a retired female soccer star with lingering talent and a strong dislike for him—something Fletcher remains oblivious to. As their relationship develops from a reluctant agreement to pose for photos together to a genuine friendship, the narrative explores themes of redemption and connection.",
            "**Fletcher** is an aspiring influencer who spends his days being filmed by an assistant to create content for his social media, all in an effort to hype up rugby in the U.S. He personifies the self-centered influencer and party guy archetype, which I found unappealing at times. However, as the story unfolds, his self-absorption begins to wane. **Goldie**, on the other hand, is a delightful character who, following an injury that ended her sports career, works as a life coach. While she fits the mold of a typical millennial inspirational figure, her charm shines through her quirky friendships with elderly companions who humorously compose obituaries for their exes. Although the connection between Fletcher and Goldie isn’t particularly strong, their interactions remain fun, lighthearted, and feel somewhat realistic in their resolution.",

When she uses Fletcher as her date to get back at her brother, she doesn’t expect to like him. Things did not turn out like they expected.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  My second favorite part of the book was the ladies of the Ex Boyfriends Club—Odette, Evelyn, and Shelia. They are my future life goals and made this book so much extra fun.

Her writing always puts me in my feels while also making me laugh, sometimes quite loudly. Her stories leave me feeling happy and light, both during and after reading. This book was no exception.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The relationship between Goldie and Fletcher was pure gold. Initially, their connection was based on team promotion and making her brother angry, but it evolved into something much deeper. I loved how Goldie was the sunshine in Fletcher’s seemingly bleak world, and Fletcher, in turn, gave Goldie the confidence and support she needed after her last failed relationship.\n\n- **Humor and Banter:**  \n  The banter between Goldie and Fletcher had me laughing throughout the entire book. Additionally, the conversations between Goldie and her \"golden oldies\" friends made me wish I had a group of friends like that too.\n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  Both characters were dealing with old wounds from their respective sports careers and past relationships. Despite trying to avoid it, their immediate connection was undeniable and beautifully portrayed.\n\n- **Series Continuity:**  \n  I loved that previous Copper Valley couples made appearances or were mentioned throughout the book, especially Luca and Henri, who are one of my favorites. The Copper Valley series has always been a favorite of mine, and this book reinforced that.\n\n- **Ending and Epilogue:**  \n  The epilogue, featuring Sweet Pea, was absolutely adorable and added a perfect touch to the story. That little extra epilogue was so dang cute!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight, just like Pippa Grant’s other works. It made me laugh, feel deeply, and left me with a sense of happiness. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartwarming and humorous read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nAmazing job ❤️ (No specific numerical rating provided, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed watching Goldie and Fletcher transition from enemies to friends and ultimately to their happily ever after. Goldie is a fierce woman on the brink of pursuing her dreams. While she doesn't need a relationship, enlisting a smoking-hot rugby player to annoy her ex and teach her brother a lesson might just be the perfect solution. Meanwhile, Fletcher is starting fresh in a new country, eager to prove himself to his ex-coach, his father, and perhaps even to himself. Goldie's acceptance and her introduction to the social scene in Cooper Valley could be just what he needs. With a supportive group of friends, an adorable niece, an irresistible pup, and a hilariously terrible mustache, the story promises plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments.",

Even a new sports romance like *Goldie’s and Fletcher’s* takes us back to Cooper Valley, where we get a glimpse and quick catch-up with some of our favorites from the area.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I enjoyed watching Goldie and Fletcher run the gamut from enemies to friends to HEA. Goldie is a badass woman on the cusp of finally doing what she wants and accomplishing her goals. She doesn’t need a relationship, but a hotter-than-hot rugby player to piss her ex off and give her brother a lesson might just fit the bill. Fletcher is starting over on this side of the pond. He needs to prove to his ex-coach, his dad, and maybe himself that he can succeed. Having gorgeous Goldie accept him and show him around the who’s who of Cooper Valley might just be the in he needs.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Atmosphere:**  \n  Add in a loving, supportive, seasoned group of friends, an adorable half-pint niece, an irresistible pup, and a horrible mustache, and hilarity is sure to follow.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I seriously laughed out loud and cried at various points.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Anticipation:**  \n  Highly recommend this HEA!! Ready for more Pounders!!!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivers a delightful mix of humor, heart, and romance, with well-developed characters and a familiar, cozy setting.

            "Goldie is a resilient and positive character, embodying the essence of a good human. In contrast, Fletch initially comes across as grumpy, egotistical, and unkind, but as the story unfolds, he becomes more endearing. Goldie's remarkable ability to understand and empathize with everyone, especially Fletch, shines through as she offers the guidance and support he and others desperately need. The family and found family surrounding Goldie are delightful, particularly the older ladies in her building, who bring humor, friendship, and a touch of sweet (and sometimes inappropriate) grandmotherly advice. The epilogue from Sweetpea's perspective is utterly charming and left me smiling throughout.",

No one in the history of England has called a selfie with two people an 'ussie.'  \n  - Scones are served with jam and cream, not as depicted in the book.  \n  - Life coaching is not really a thing in the UK, so the internship plotline felt completely out of place.  \n  - There is no singular university in London; there are forty universities in London.  \n\n- **Use of Artistic License:**  \n  - I understand that artistic license exists, but the inaccuracies were so glaring that they detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Humor and Enjoyment:**  \n  - I usually love Pippa Grant's books—they're always funny, and this one delivered on that front, which is why I gave it a three-star rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its humorous moments and maintained the author's signature charm, the numerous cultural inaccuracies regarding British customs and settings were distracting and frustrating.

            "The novel effectively weaves together popular tropes such as Enemies to Lovers, Brother's Teammate, and Sports Romance (Rugby), while also exploring the theme of Found Family. However, despite the promising elements, they ultimately fell short of my expectations.",

Once they started to really talk, I loved both Fletcher and Goldie. They both let their insecurities get in their way from time to time but worked through it and achieved their happily ever after (HEA).  \n\n- **Plot Dynamics and Team Involvement:**  \n  I loved how the team came together and helped Fletcher when Goldie moved to London.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a testament to Pippa’s skill in crafting engaging Romcoms. While it took some time to fully connect with the characters, the development of Fletcher and Goldie, along with the team’s involvement, made for a satisfying and heartwarming story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  I had some pacing issues with the novel. It felt like nothing was driving the story until the last 20% of the book. The lack of conflict made the narrative feel slow and uneventful for a significant portion of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The male main character (MMC) was the only one who had a dramatic character arc, which made the story feel somewhat flat. I wished for more depth and development in the other characters, particularly the female main character (FMC).  \n\n- **Chemistry Between Characters:**  \n  The FMC and MMC had great chemistry, which was one of the highlights of the book. Their interactions were engaging and added a lot of charm to the story.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The story lacked a strong driving force until the final section of the book. I felt that more rugby scenes could have added excitement and helped balance the pacing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and enjoyable read, but it fell short of being a 5-star book due to pacing issues, uneven character development, and a lack of conflict for much of the story. The chemistry between the FMC and MMC was a standout element, but the narrative needed more momentum and depth to fully captivate me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI wanted this to be 5 stars, but due to the issues mentioned, it didn’t quite reach that level."
