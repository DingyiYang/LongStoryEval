            "Owen and Shona's relationship is both adorable and heartwarming. I particularly loved how Owen attentively noted Shona's preferences, surprising her with thoughtful little gifts throughout the story. His evolving bond with his mother also adds emotional depth and growth to his character. The delightful gnomes and hedgehogs enchanted me, and I found myself utterly obsessed with them. When the residents of Loren Brae welcomed Owen after recognizing his genuine care for Shona, it beautifully illustrated a sense of community. Shona's hesitance to share her magical life with Owen felt justified, given their short acquaintance. Yet, Owen’s frustration at being left in the dark was understandable, adding tension and realism to their relationship. This dynamic made their eventual resolution all the more satisfying.",

I can’t wait to see what comes next in this enchanting story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tropes/Themes:**  \n  - Forced Proximity, He Falls First, Found Family, Banter, Small Town in Scotland, Magic, Secret Society, Clyde the Coo, Gnomes.  \n  - The tropes and themes in this book are well-executed and add depth to the story. The small-town setting of Loren Brae feels vibrant and immersive, making me wish it were a real place.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  - Owen and Shona’s relationship is adorable and heartwarming. I particularly loved how Owen paid attention to Shona’s likes and gave her thoughtful little presents throughout the story.  \n  - Owen’s evolving relationship with his mother is another highlight, as it adds emotional depth and growth to his character.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and World-Building:**  \n  - The gnomes and hedgies are delightful additions to the story, and I found myself completely obsessed with them.  \n  - The way the other characters in Loren Brae welcomed Owen once they realized he genuinely cared for Shona was touching and added to the sense of community.  \n\n- **Conflict and Character Development:**  \n  - Shona’s hesitancy to reveal the magical aspects of her life to Owen felt valid, given the short time they had known each other. However, I also understood Owen’s frustration at being kept in the dark.  \n  - This conflict added tension and realism to their relationship, making their eventual resolution more satisfying.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  - I am eagerly waiting for a book about Agnes and Graham, as their dynamic seems intriguing and worth exploring further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is the fourth book I’ve read in this world, and it continues to bring me immense joy. The charming setting, lovable characters, and magical elements make it a delightful read. Owen and Shona’s relationship is heartwarming, and the supporting cast adds depth and humor to the story. I can’t wait to see what comes next in this enchanting series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance between Shona, a garden witch, and Owen, an American filmmaker, is charming and low on angst. Owen is immediately smitten with Shona, displaying a flirtatious nature while reassuring her that he appreciates her despite her insecurities. His thoughtfulness and helpfulness make him the ideal book boyfriend. Shona, though a bit clumsy and insecure, confidently embraces her passions, including her garden, fancy lingerie, and her feelings for Owen. While there are elements of instalove and instalust, their relationship develops naturally, which I truly appreciate. The tension as they navigate their emotions is well-crafted, and the intimate moments are perfectly timed. Shona’s garden witch powers are a delightful aspect of the story, and Gnorman the gnome adds a fun touch with his snarky comments that had me laughing out loud. Eugene the hedgehog might just be my favorite little critter—sorry, Clyde the ghost!",

This approach feels a lot healthier than placing the burden of fixing everything on one person.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n  For anyone struggling with a narcissistic relationship or the effects of breaking away from one, I really think this book could be beneficial. It effectively shows how to make and enforce boundaries, which is a valuable takeaway.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Side Characters:**  \n  The banter and the side characters are always a delight in Tricia’s books, but she really took it a step further with Gnorman and Eugene! They added a lot of charm and depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Group Dynamics:**  \n  I would really like to see more of the order working together.

            "Shona is a relatable and endearing protagonist who enjoys true-crime podcasts and embodies the idea that happiness and success don’t require traditional smarts. Owen starts as a self-absorbed filmmaker, failing to recognize the impact of his work on the locals, including Shona. However, he ultimately redeems himself, and his mother’s narcissistic behavior, alongside his coping mechanisms, provides a credible backdrop for his flaws. Clyde, the ghostly Highland coo, consistently adds charm to the story, while Gnorman, Shona’s quirky gnome companion, along with his hedgehog army led by Eugene, injects humor. The romance between Shona and Owen is delightful, featuring some swoon-worthy moments, though Owen's abrupt advances initially raise doubts about his sincerity. While their chemistry is palpable, the relationship develops quickly and lacks depth, particularly given Owen's frequent travels as a non-local.",
            "In the fourth book, some conversations, such as Shona's introduction to the Knighthood, come across as repetitive and blunt. It would be nice to have options to skip or vary these interactions. However, the banter and humor, particularly involving the gnomes, are well-executed and enhance the book's charm.",

Shona’s cottage, vibrant markets, and conversations about local produce and sustainable gardening enhance the cozy atmosphere. The enchanting elements of Loren Brae and the unfolding tale of the Order of Caledonia create a delightful backdrop for the story."

She listens to true-crime podcasts, doesn’t take herself too seriously, and shows that one doesn’t need to be book-smart to lead a happy and successful life.\n   - Owen is initially self-involved and doesn’t fully appreciate the consequences of his filmmaking on the locals and Shona. However, he redeems himself by the end. His mother’s narcissistic tendencies and his coping mechanisms provide a realistic explanation for his flaws.\n   - Clyde, the ghostly Highland coo, is a favorite recurring character.\n   - Gnorman, Shona’s gnome sidekick, and his hedgehog army, including Eugene, add charm and humor to the story.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The love story between Shona and Owen is enjoyable, with Owen making some swoon-worthy moves. However, his sudden and strong advances initially made me question his sincerity.\n   - While their attraction is believable, the relationship progresses quickly without gaining much depth, especially considering Owen’s non-local status and frequent travels.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**\n   - The book captures cozy small-town vibes, making readers fall in love with Scotland. Shona’s cottage, the markets, and discussions about produce and sustainable gardening add to the coziness.\n   - The magical whims of Loren Brae and the ongoing story of the Order of Caledonia provide a charming backdrop.\n\n- **Series Continuity:**\n   - This book can be read as a standalone, as the love story is self-contained. However, the overarching story of Loren Brae and the Order of Caledonia is continuous, and some context may be missed without reading the previous books.\n   - By the fourth book, a pattern emerges (e.g., one American and one Scottish love interest, insta-love, quirky female, hunky male), which I hope the author will break in future installments.\n\n- **Writing and Dialogue:**\n   - Some conversations, like Shona’s introduction to the Knighthood, feel repetitive and blunt by the fourth book. I wish there were a way to skip or vary these interactions.\n   - The banter and humor, especially involving the gnomes, are well-executed and add to the book’s charm.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The narrators, particularly Amy Landon, do an excellent job with voice acting, bringing the characters and humor to life. The banter and hilarity of the gnomes are especially well-conveyed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a delightful addition to the Enchanted Highlands series, offering a cozy small-town romance with magical whims, gardening vibes, and charming characters.

He expresses affection through acts of giving, which contrasts sharply with Shona’s simple lifestyle. Adding humor to the story is Gnorman, Shona’s tattooed gnome familiar, whose attitude is both hilarious and endearing. The narrative is further enriched by Eugene, the pet hedgehog, and appearances from Coo, Clyde, and the menacing kelpies. The chemistry between Shona and Owen is palpable, marked by sparks, misunderstandings, and the challenges posed by their differing worlds. Owen feels an undeniable connection to Shona, as if she completes him, and their mutual dependence propels the romance forward. Their witty banter, filled with garden puns, infuses their interactions with humor and lightness.",

        "conclusion": "Wild Scottish Rose is a delightful addition to The Enchanted Highlands Series, blending magic, romance, and humor seamlessly. Shona and Owen’s chemistry, along with the quirky supporting characters, makes this a captivating read.

            "I was eager to explore the story of the Green/Garden Witch, a character perfectly suited to the enchanting backdrop of Scotland. The premise of an American filmmaker visiting for his sister's wedding and encountering a magical florist/gardener held great promise. Unfortunately, the Scottish protagonist was as grumpy as her garden gnome, while the filmmaker appeared disingenuous and self-serving, intent on exploiting local beliefs for his expose. Their dynamic felt contrived, undermining the believability of their happily ever after.",
            "The earlier books beautifully captured Scottish culture through their vivid depictions of language, cuisine, kilts, and landscapes. However, this installment fell short in its portrayal of Scotland, lacking the rich cultural immersion that made the story unique. I hope the next book reintroduces the quirky, charming characters and weaves in more Scottish elements.",
            "The earlier books in the series were brimming with humor, quirky characters, and enchanting beings, making them a joy to read. Unfortunately, this installment lacked the laugh-out-loud moments and whimsical charm I anticipated. The garden puns, mythical hedgehogs, and the garden gnome were the only highlights that kept me engaged; without them, I might not have finished the book.",
            "I eagerly anticipated *Wild Scottish Rose* after thoroughly enjoying the previous installments. The first book beautifully introduced Scotland through a tourist's perspective, weaving together myths, unique terminology, and a quest-driven love story. The second book followed suit, featuring an American chef in a Scottish castle, while the novella added a delightful Christmas-themed romance. All were charming, humorous, and infused with magic and mythological beings. Unfortunately, *Wild Scottish Rose* fell short, lacking the charm, Scottish phrases, humor, and positivity that characterized the earlier books."

The first book introduced the series, showcasing Scotland through a tourist's eyes, blending myths, unique terminology, and a quest-driven love story. The second book followed a similar pattern with an American chef in a Scottish castle, and the novella added a Christmas-themed romance. All were charming, humorous, and filled with magic and mythological beings.\n   - Sadly, *Wild Scottish Rose* lacked the charm, Scottish phrases, laugh-out-loud moments, and positivity of the earlier books.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**\n   - I was excited to get to know the main character, a \"Green/Garden Witch,\" as she seemed like a natural fit for the magical setting of Scotland. The premise of an American filmmaker visiting for his sister's wedding and meeting the magical florist/gardener sounded promising.\n   - However, the Scottish protagonist was as grumpy as her garden gnome, and the filmmaker came across as fake-charming and self-centered, determined to exploit local beliefs for his expose. Their dynamic felt forced, making it hard to believe in their \"happily ever after.\"\n\n- **Humor and Mythological Elements:**\n   - The previous books were filled with humor, quirky characters, and magical beings, which made them delightful reads. This book, however, fell short in delivering laugh-out-loud moments and the whimsical charm I expected.\n   - The garden puns, mythical hedgehogs, and the garden gnome were the only redeeming elements that kept me reading. Without them, I might not have finished the book.\n\n- **Cultural and Setting Representation:**\n   - The earlier books excelled in showcasing Scottish culture, including words, foods, kilts, and scenery. This book felt lacking in its portrayal of Scotland, missing the rich cultural immersion that made the series special.\n   - I hope the next book, *Ramsey's Book*, returns to the quirky, charming characters and incorporates more Scottish elements.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - *Wild Scottish Rose* was a disappointment compared to the previous books. It didn’t deliver the fun, opposites-attract magical romance I was hoping for. Instead, it felt like a story of grumpy meets fake-charming, with little chemistry or believability.\n   - While it’s an okay read for fans of the series due to the gnomes and hedgehogs, I wouldn’t recommend it to newcomers. They should start with the earlier books instead.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Wild Scottish Rose* didn’t live up to the charm and magic of the previous books in the series. While it had some redeeming elements like the garden gnome and hedgehogs, the lack of humor, cultural depth, and believable romance made it a letdown. I’m hopeful the next installment will return to the series’ roots and deliver the quirky, Scottish-infused charm I love.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a lower rating compared to the previous books."

            "I was thrilled to find that this was the fourth installment, allowing me to delve into the earlier works and uncover the story's origins. The book masterfully weaves together romance, a strong and sassy protagonist, magical flora, mystical creatures, a grumpy gnome, and an army of hedgehogs. It brims with humor, especially from Gnorman's antics, alongside awe-inspiring moments like encounters with unicorns and 'Harry Coo's'. The stunning Scottish settings and the blossoming romance enrich the narrative with depth and charm.",

However, I found the male lead, Owen, to be cocky, arrogant, and rude, particularly in his interactions with the doctor, which made it difficult for me to see him as charming. I would have preferred Shona to be infatuated with someone kinder and more humble, though I recognize that Owen's flaws are essential to the story.",

It irks me when characters get mad at others for not revealing a secret—it’s a secret for a reason!  \n\n- **Narration and Writing Style:**  \n   - The narration was great, and I loved the Scottish accent.  \n\n- **Supporting Elements and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The hedgehog was a cute addition to the story.  \n   - The gnomes freaked me out a bit, to be honest.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n   - The conflict at the end felt odd and poorly handled. Owen’s redemption at the end didn’t do much to improve my opinion of him, as I had already spent most of the book disliking him.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some charming elements, like the banter between the main couple, the cute hedgehog, and the enjoyable narration, it fell short in several areas. Owen’s character was largely unlikable, the insta-love trope felt forced, and the magic system and conflict resolution were underdeveloped. Overall, the book had potential but didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

The setting felt magical and immersive, making me wish it were real.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tricia O’Malley has a real knack for writing characters that readers can truly identify with and fall in love with. Shona and Owen, in particular, continued to surprise me with their back-and-forth, creating delicious tension throughout the story. The side characters were also adorable and so well-written that I wished they were real, too.\n\n- **Dialogue and Humor:**  \n  The banter was spot-on, and the heat between the characters was palpable. The clever puns and dad jokes added a delightful layer of humor that I absolutely loved.\n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  While this book *could* be read as a stand-alone, I believe it’s best enjoyed when read in order of the series (starting with *Wild Scottish Knight*, followed by *Wild Scottish Love*, *A Kilt for Christmas*, and then *Wild Scottish Rose*). Reading the series in order enhances the overall experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful return to the enchanting world of Loren Brae, filled with lovable characters, witty dialogue, and a touch of magic. Tricia O’Malley’s storytelling shines, making this a must-read for fans of the series and newcomers alike.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the roles were reversed (an American man and a Scottish woman), and the powers were different, the overall storyline of love felt repetitive.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  The book was an easy read, and I enjoyed the humor brought by the gnomes and hedgehogs, which made me laugh out loud several times.  \n\n- **Character Development and Continuity:**  \n  I appreciated that the main storyline carried through with characters from previous books, which added a sense of continuity and depth to the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some enjoyable elements, such as the humor and continuity with previous characters, the plot lacked originality and relied too heavily on a familiar romantic trope.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While Agnes posed some challenges, the story was ultimately sweet and enjoyable. The resolution at the end effectively alleviated earlier frustrations.",
            "I found Agnes' behavior in this book frustrating, especially in comparison to my previous enjoyment of her character. For over 60% of the story, she was unreasonably harsh toward Shona, which hindered my ability to connect with her. Although Agnes eventually softened, her overbearing attitude—treating Shona like a child rather than an independent adult—was exasperating. While friendly advice would have been welcome, her excessive control overshadowed Shona's autonomy. I appreciated Shona's independence, but Agnes' constant interference detracted from my enjoyment of her journey."

        "conclusion": "While the novel had a sweet and engaging storyline, Agnes’ behavior toward Shona was a significant drawback for me. Her overbearing nature made it hard to fully enjoy the book, even though she eventually redeemed herself. Shona’s independence was a highlight, but it was often overshadowed by Agnes’ actions. Overall, it’s a decent read, but Agnes’ character arc could have been handled better.",

She was awful to Shona for more than 60% of the story, which made it hard to connect with her character. While she did come around in the end, her overbearing attitude toward Shona—treating her like a child rather than an adult capable of making her own decisions—was frustrating. Friendly advice would have been fine, but this felt excessive and controlling.\n\n- **Character Development (Shona):**  \n  Shona is portrayed as an adult with her own mind, and I appreciated her independence.
