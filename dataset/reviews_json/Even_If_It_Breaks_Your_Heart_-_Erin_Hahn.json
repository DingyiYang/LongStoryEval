        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is strong and engaging. The opening scene, though familiar in theme, held my attention with its fresh execution. The narrator's self-effacing notes felt natural and unforced, making the scene compelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The details in the story make the characters, especially Winnie, relatable and easy to connect with. The smoothly interconnecting details help me understand their motivations and emotions deeply.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - Once the plot unfolds, it becomes excellent. The story captures the heart and agony of neglect, making even the smallest, imperfect spaces feel significant and worth protecting.  \n\n- **Thematic Depth:**  \n   - The novel delves into themes of love, neglect, and belonging. The emotional resonance is strong, particularly in how it portrays the attachment to one's own space and the people within it.  \n\n- **Content and Detail:**  \n   - The horse racing and bull-riding details are exciting and add a unique flavor to the story. While there’s a lot of this content, and not all of it feels necessary, it still enhances the overall experience.  \n\n- **Narrative Techniques:**  \n   - The fourth-wall breakage around loc.497 is intriguing but slightly jarring due to the tone shift within the parenthetical paragraph. It’s a creative choice that almost works perfectly but feels inconsistent at first.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The story takes a while to come together, and I was unsure of its direction until about halfway through. However, it resolves well by the midpoint.  \n\n- **Language and Tone:**  \n   - The casual name-calling (e.g., \"dummy,\" \"idiot\") detracts from the overall tone and feels unnecessary.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Even If It Breaks Your Heart* is a compelling read with strong writing, relatable characters, and an engaging plot. While it has some pacing issues and minor tonal inconsistencies, the emotional depth and unique details make it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🐎🐎🐎🐎 / 5 bucking broncos  \n\n**Recommend?**  \nYes!  \n\n**Read this book if you like:**  \n💖 Young romance  \n🐴 Ranch stories  \n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family stories and drama  \n👭🏽 Sister stories  \n💇‍♀️ Girl's coming of age  \n🏇 Horse racing and rodeo"

While I understand that many teens talk like this, it felt excessive and detracted from my enjoyment. I would have rated this aspect 1 star.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  - There was much underage drinking, often at parties where parents deliberately looked the other way.  \n  - A main character’s loss of virginity and frequent discussions about sexual exploits by male characters were present.  \n  - Parental neglect was a glaring issue, particularly in the case of one main character’s family, where the teen had to take on adult responsibilities at a very young age.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - I would recommend this book only with a suggestion of parental guidance for impressionable readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the Texas setting, barrel racing theme, and the bond between Winnie and her sister were strong points, the excessive vulgar language and mature themes (underage drinking, sexual content, and parental neglect) significantly impacted my enjoyment. This book has potential but requires caution for younger or impressionable readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Setting and Theme: 4 stars  \n- Language and Tone: 1 star  \n- Overall Recommendation: Proceed with parental guidance."
