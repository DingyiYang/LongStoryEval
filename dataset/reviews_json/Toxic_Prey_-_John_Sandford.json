            "The novel delves into the Gaia hypothesis, depicting a world where Earth's self-regulating systems are jeopardized by rampant population growth and human intervention. The narrative centers on Dr. Lionel Scott, an infectious disease specialist who mysteriously goes missing, alarming high-ranking officials. Letty Davenport, a Homeland Security agent, takes on the investigation, embarking on a high-stakes mission that involves her father, Lucas, and a cast of familiar characters from earlier installments. The plot may seem far-fetched, yet it resonates with a haunting plausibility, driving escalating events that create a gripping sense of urgency and tension throughout the story.",
            "Letty and Lucas Davenport are clever, relentless, and unafraid of conflict, with a natural and well-balanced partnership. Lucas, a skilled hunter, complements Letty's strength and independence, allowing her to hold her own in the action. Their dynamic, particularly Letty's interactions with MI5 agent Alec Hawkins, introduces humor and complexity, especially evident in Lucas's reactions to their ambiguous relationship. Thankfully, the author avoids forcing the partnership between Lucas and Letty, while readers hope this dynamic won't be overused in future installments. The inclusion of returning characters adds depth and continuity to the story, and the clear distinction between books featuring Lucas, Letty, and Virgil Flowers is appreciated, with a desire for this balance to be maintained in upcoming works.",
            "The author shines as a master storyteller, crafting an intelligent and engaging plot that captivates readers from start to finish. The narrative strikes a perfect balance between seriousness and humor, with Lucas's interactions and observations providing delightful moments of levity. The tone is both gripping and witty, ensuring that I remain fully engaged and entertained throughout.",
            "This novel explores the delicate balance of the environment, the ethics of scientific inquiry, and the potential abuses of biological research. It poses critical questions about humanity's impact on Earth's equilibrium and the repercussions of unchecked technological and population growth."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a strong entry in the author's crime fiction, featuring a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and a perfect blend of tension and humor. The partnership between Lucas and Letty Davenport is executed skillfully, and the story's exploration of timely themes adds depth to the narrative. While the dynamic between the two leads works well here, there is a hope that it isn't overused in future installments to maintain the subtle distinctions. Overall, it's a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The story revolves around Dr. Lionel Scott, an expert in infectious diseases, who believes the Earth is dying due to overpopulation and plans to unleash a virus to solve the problem.  \n  - Letty is tasked with tracking down Scott, leading to a race against time to stop him before the virus is released.  \n  - The premise of using a virus to reduce population is not new, but Sandford's execution makes it engaging and unique.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n  - The book maintains a fantastic pace, with non-stop action that keeps the reader hooked.  \n  - The story is described as a page-turner, with the tension and urgency never letting up.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - This is primarily a Letty and Lucas Davenport story, with a brief mention of Virgil Flowers.  \n  - Sandford is praised for his ability to write compelling antagonists, particularly the \"true believers\" who are willing to kill billions for their cause.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  - The ending is described as disturbing and impactful, with Sandford not holding back in delivering a chilling conclusion.  \n  - The reviewer hopes that those in positions of power take note of the story's implications.  \n\n- **Stand-Alone Potential:**  \n  - The book can be enjoyed as a stand-alone novel, even though it is part of a long-running series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Toxic Prey* is another gripping addition to John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series, blending a familiar premise with masterful execution. The fast-paced action, well-crafted characters, and unsettling ending make it a standout read. While the concept of a virus to reduce population isn't new, Sandford's storytelling elevates it into a thrilling and thought-provoking narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot is grander in scale than Lucas Davenport's typical cases, featuring a deadly virus and a global threat. The narrative is filled with relentless action and tension, maintaining my engagement from start to finish.",
            "In this book, Lucas Davenport adopts a more supportive role that feels somewhat disconnected from his previous storylines. Rae's return is a standout feature, and the introduction of Barb Cartwright is intriguing, sparking my interest in her backstory. However, Letty's character development seems abrupt, as she transitions from a college student to someone holding high-level homeland security trust and clearance at a surprisingly young age."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed this book a lot, especially the action-packed plot and the introduction of new characters. However, I felt a bit lost with Letty’s character progression and realized I need to go back and read the first two Letty books to fully appreciate her development. Despite this, the story was engaging, and the narration was excellent.",

            "This novel is the strongest installment yet, offering a captivating story and well-developed characters. It expertly reflects the post-pandemic societal zeitgeist, with a plot that generates a constant sense of urgency. The narrative maintains a gripping pace without any slow moments. Centered around virologist Dr. Scott and his misguided environmental terrorism, the story balances serious themes with dark humor. The climax features the release of a deadly virus, creating a tense atmosphere, yet concludes on an anticlimactic note as the main characters survive.",
            "Letty Davenport's character truly shines in this installment, as her role as a DHS agent ventures into exciting new territory. Dr. Scott emerges as a compelling antagonist—not outright evil, but nuanced and strangely likable in a twisted way. Lucas Davenport's acknowledgment of his age suggests potential retirement, adding depth to his character. Letty’s new love interest, Alec Hawkins, is engaging and well-drawn, surpassing her previous, less-developed romantic partner. Supporting characters like Packer and Billy Greet are also well-developed, enriching the story further.",

Her relationship with Davenport felt unnatural and unwholesome, particularly his creepy interest in discussing her sexual activities.\n   - **Negative:** The absence of familiar characters was disappointing. Instead, there were dozens of new characters associated with various 3-letter governmental agencies, which eliminated the enjoyable, often crude cross-talk typical of Sandford’s books.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - **Positive:** The lengthy dramatic conclusion was gripping, even for someone who prefers lower-key, psychological resolutions.\n   - **Positive:** The plot was well-constructed, with plausible motives, means, and methods for the killers. The villains were well-drawn and believable, making them some of Sandford’s best in years.\n\n- **Themes and Ethical Questions:**\n   - **Positive:** The novel raises a difficult ethical question, which I found more absorbing than typical conflicts involving robbers, forgers, or murderers. The scenario involving a potential vampire outbreak and the moral dilemmas it presents was particularly thought-provoking.\n   - **Positive:** The ethical question is framed around the idea of sacrificing a few to save many, with characters responding to objections in a way that highlights the complexity of such decisions.

As events unfold back in the States, Scott’s plot to unleash a disease deadlier than Covid—aimed at \"saving\" Gaia—takes shape. Letty is dispatched to track him down and thwart this deadly scheme, which threatens to wipe out 80% of the world's population.

While I’ve never read a mediocre book in the series, some novels stand out more than others.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  I particularly enjoy Mr. Sanford's astute (and sometimes snarky) commentary, often presented through character dialogue. In *Toxic Prey*, the 34th book in the series, the father/daughter team of Lucas and Letty Davenport takes center stage.

His work consistently delivers engaging narratives and memorable characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Suspense:**  \n  This book was very suspenseful, and I really could not put it down. The premise involves Letty, her dad Lucas, and a cast of characters stumbling onto a plot by Gaia fanatics (or lunatics, as I would call them) who have merged a deadly virus with measles. This virus could kill 80% of those infected, and the race to stop the fanatics before their plans go into effect kept me on edge.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I even got stressed a little while reading it. The story was so gripping that I found myself practically holding my breath at times.  \n\n- **Relevance and Realism:**  \n  One of the reasons the book was so intense is that these types of lunatics exist in real life, and their ultimate goal is to rid the earth of billions of people. The story felt eerily plausible, especially with the mention of open borders, making it a scary yet thought-provoking read.  \n\n- **Spoiler-Free Appreciation:**  \n  I won’t give away any spoilers, but the book’s potential to reflect real-world dangers added to its impact.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I would like to thank Putnam Books and NetGalley for the early read.

It's also a Letty book, and I love it when those two work together.  \n  - Virgil gets mentioned a couple of times, which adds to the continuity of the series.  \n  - The characters are great as usual, and we see a side to Lucas that we've never seen before.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - Lionel Scott, an Oxford-educated doctor, has worked in some of the most desperate places in the world. He becomes a believer in the Gaia movement, a radical group that believes there are too many people and the earth will not survive.  \n  - When Lionel goes missing, DHS calls in Letty to find him. He has spent time at Fort Detrick and Los Alamos working on viruses, and the US government needs to locate him.  \n  - Lucas and Rae are brought in for the hunt, leading to whirlwind trips around New Mexico as they try to track Lionel and his small group of co-conspirators.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  - The ending is so well-written and concludes the story in a satisfying way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel stands out as one of the best in the series, with strong character dynamics, an engaging plot, and a well-crafted ending. The collaboration between Lucas and Letty, along with the introduction of Lionel Scott and his radical beliefs, makes for a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I’ve enjoyed them very much, but this one stands out. Sandford really outdoes himself here, delivering a story that feels fresh and impactful.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The idea of bioterrorism in this novel is horribly frightening, especially after the Covid pandemic. It feels eerily plausible, which adds to the intensity and realism of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  Sandford introduces his newest character, Letty Davenport, who works alongside her father, Lucas Davenport (the main character of most Prey novels). Their dynamic, along with a recurring cast of characters, makes the story feel authentic and engaging. I particularly enjoyed how Sandford expanded the regular cast by incorporating the military, which felt logical given the scale of the threat.  \n\n- **World-Building and Expansion:**  \n  The expansion of Sandford’s world is a welcome addition. It’s refreshing to see Lucas Davenport take a step back while still being part of the story, as he deserves a break. This shift allows new characters and elements to shine.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  This book is another home run for the author. It’s intense, realistic, and thoroughly engaging. I highly recommend it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in Sandford’s repertoire, combining a terrifyingly plausible plot with strong character dynamics and world-building.

The tension is maintained throughout, making it impossible to put the book down.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Letty introduces a new English boyfriend to collaborate with, while Lucas reunites with his marshal friend Rae Givens. Cartwright the sniper also plays a key role, though Virgil Flowers is notably absent (as he has become a semi-famous author).  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The story raises thought-provoking questions, similar to Dan Brown's *Inferno*, about whether the antagonists' goal of dramatically reducing Earth's population to save the planet could be seen as morally justifiable. However, the extreme measure of killing 5 billion people clearly undermines any notion of them being \"good.\"  \n\n- **Engagement and Impact:**  \n  The novel is well-crafted, keeping the reader's attention from start to finish. It also prompts reflection on potential threats to human existence.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping and thought-provoking novel that masterfully blends action, character dynamics, and moral dilemmas. It keeps readers engaged while challenging them to consider the ethical complexities of global threats.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The scientist aims to save the earth (Gaia) by eliminating half of the population using a deadly microbe he created by combining the measles virus (for its high communicability) and the Marburg virus (for its high death rate).  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Lucas Davenport is portrayed as a capable and determined protagonist, working alongside his daughter, Letty, whose role in Homeland Security adds depth to their dynamic. Alec Hawkins, an MI5 agent, is introduced as a British counterpart assisting the U.S. in thwarting the scientist's plans, adding an international dimension to the story.  \n\n- **Conflict and Tension:**  \n  The central conflict involves the race against time to stop the mad scientist from releasing the deadly microbe. The stakes are incredibly high, as the potential loss of half the population creates a sense of urgency and tension throughout the narrative.  \n\n- **Resolution:**  \n  The team almost succeeds in preventing the tragedy, leaving the outcome somewhat ambiguous and adding a layer of suspense to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel presents a gripping and high-stakes plot centered around a mad scientist's plan to save the earth by eliminating half of its population. The collaboration between Lucas Davenport, his daughter Letty, and MI5 agent Alec Hawkins adds depth to the story, while the tension and urgency of the mission keep the reader engaged.

            "The novel begins slowly, with some sections feeling drawn out. Despite this, the overall story is compelling and chilling.",
            "I enjoy both Lucas and Letty as characters, though I typically prefer them separately in stories. In this case, however, I appreciated their dynamic, particularly as Lucas juggled his roles as a marshal and a father in a dire situation. While I’m uncertain about Hawkins’ longevity in the narrative, I find him intriguing and hope to see more of him. I was also pleasantly surprised to connect with other characters like Rae, Andreas, Greet, and Caughlin the sniper. The cast was well-developed, and I found myself reluctant to let any of them go—definitely a testament to good storytelling!",

The narrative alternates between three main threads: Letty and Scott, Lucas and Rae, and the cult members.

As they delve into the scientist's plans, high-ranking officials like Lucas become involved, leading them to pinpoint the scientist's location in Taos, NM. The urgency to thwart his plan adds a gripping tension throughout the story. The conclusion is both satisfying and realistic, resolving the plot in a manner that feels plausible and impactful. At its core, the story follows a British scientist who believes that Gaia (Mother Earth) must eliminate most of the global population to recover. Along with other radicals, he develops a deadly virus aimed to be released through airports for rapid dissemination. The premise, rooted in germ warfare, remains both engaging and plausible.",

I didn’t feel lost or confused despite not having read the previous books.\n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The story revolves around Lucas and Letty, a father-daughter team, who work together to locate a zealous climate activist/scientist. His plan to release a dangerous virus in populated areas feels urgent and imminent, adding tension to the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  Sandford’s quick pacing and detailed descriptions significantly contribute to the success of the story. The plot moves swiftly, keeping me engaged throughout.\n\n- **Real-World Relevance and Plausibility:**  \n  The story felt particularly relevant and plausible, especially after witnessing real-life climate activists splashing priceless artworks with red paint. It also brought back memories of the Covid lockdown, particularly when a church in the story is exposed to the virus, adding an eerie sense of realism.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Toxic Prey* is a gripping and well-paced thriller that works excellently as a stand-alone novel. The father-daughter dynamic between Lucas and Letty, combined with the urgent and plausible plot, makes for an engaging read. Sandford’s writing style and attention to detail enhance the story’s realism and relevance to current events.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot:**  \n   - The plot was fine, but it didn't feel like it was solely written by John Sandford. It read as if there were two writers, and I suspect some parts were written by a female writer.  \n\n- **Editing:**  \n   - The editing was poor, with numerous mistakes throughout the book. I was surprised by the lack of quality, especially if Sandford has new editors.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Lucas Davenport wasn't as prominent in this book as in previous Prey novels. The focus shifted more to Letty.  \n   - Letty's character felt inconsistent. As a young professional woman, her immediate decision to hop into bed with an MI5 officer after just meeting him was unconvincing and unrealistic, especially given her role in the DHS. Their relationship felt contrived and unnecessary.  \n   - Rae's character didn't add much to the story; she felt more like a tag-along.  \n   - The \"bad guys\" were underdeveloped and lacked depth, making them unconvincing as antagonists.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Interaction:**  \n   - I missed Lucas' clever banter, which might have been absent because Virgil wasn't involved in the story.  \n\n- **Series Evolution:**  \n   - Lucas is aging in the series, which explains why he sees less action. While I understand this progression, I miss the younger, more dynamic Lucas.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book was fine but definitely not Sandford's best. I hope the next Prey book might explore a flashback story set in Lucas' younger days.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot was serviceable, the book suffered from poor editing, inconsistent character development, and underdeveloped antagonists. The shift in focus from Lucas to Letty didn't entirely work, and some character decisions felt unrealistic.

The plot centers on a disillusioned physician/scientist who engineers a hybrid Marburg/measles virus in a bid to reduce the population and save the Earth. Its themes echo those of the movie *Outbreak*, set in a small-town backdrop and showcasing a fortunate turn of events for the authorities.",
            "In this latest installment, Lucas Davenport navigates the complexities of aging and evolving life circumstances. As someone of a similar age, I appreciate Lucas’s commitment to law enforcement, which keeps him engaged—something he admits he’d struggle with otherwise. He’s a compelling and complex character, grappling with darkness and depression, unflinchingly willing to resort to violence, though not as extreme as Dirty Harry. Despite what would likely result in his dismissal in the real world, Lucas’s career continues to advance—from Minneapolis homicide detective to Minnesota State Investigator, and now a U.S. Marshal. \n\nPreviously, Lucas was paired with Virgil Flowers, a character whose light-heartedness offered a stark contrast to Lucas’s heavier persona. Virgil’s reluctance to wield a gun highlighted their differences. In this entry, Lucas teams up with his daughter Letty, who has matured from the twelve-year-old introduced in *Naked Prey* into a capable young woman in her twenties, also in law enforcement. Like her father, Letty embraces her lethal capabilities, making them a fitting duo."

Each book stands alone and is entertaining in its own right, though some are better than others.  \n   - I’ve read every book in the series, and by *Naked Prey*, I was reading each one shortly after it was published.  \n\n- **Character Development (Lucas Davenport):**  \n   - Lucas Davenport, the main character, ages throughout the series, and his life circumstances evolve with him.  \n   - As someone around Lucas’s age, I appreciate that he’s in law enforcement but acknowledges he’d go crazy with boredom if he couldn’t do what he does best.  \n   - Lucas is a likable but dark character, prone to depression and unafraid to kill. While not as extreme as Dirty Harry, he doesn’t hesitate to pull the trigger.  \n   - In real life, Lucas would have been forced out of his job, but in this universe, he keeps advancing—from Minneapolis homicide to Minnesota State Investigator and, most recently, a U.S. Marshal.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Lucas and Virgil Flowers):**  \n   - In the past three entries before this one, Lucas was paired with Virgil Flowers, a lighter, happier, and well-adjusted character who contrasts with Lucas’s darker tone.  \n   - Virgil rarely carries or uses his gun, which is a stark difference from Lucas.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Lucas and Letty):**  \n   - In this most recent entry, Lucas is paired with his daughter, Letty, who was introduced in *Naked Prey* and has since grown from a twelve-year-old girl to a young woman in her twenties working in law enforcement.  \n   - Like Lucas, Letty is a killer and unafraid to use her gun, making her a fitting partner for her father.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The plot revolves around a disillusioned physician/scientist who develops a hybrid Marburg/measles virus to reduce the planet’s population and save Earth.  \n   - The story bears similarities to the movie *Outbreak*, with a small-town setting and a streak of luck for the authorities.  \n\n- **Pacing and Action:**  \n   - The action in this book is great, and Lucas and Letty save the day, which is expected given it’s the 35th entry in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book. The action is engaging, and the dynamic between Lucas and Letty adds a fresh layer to the series.

The relentless tension propels the story forward, making it a captivating read.",

I was glad to see Barbara return, but she, along with the other Marshall characters, felt underutilized and only briefly introduced. It seems like Flowers might be getting phased out, which is disappointing. I’m uncertain if Letty will continue to be the focus in future installments, but I will keep reading the series.",

            "The story follows Letty, a British MI5 agent, and her partner Lucas as they pursue a group possessing a deadly virus. Their pursuit culminates in a gripping confrontation in a church, where the virus is unleashed, infecting many. Though Letty and Hawk manage to eliminate the final member of the group, they too are infected but ultimately survive. The novel is fast-paced, filled with intense action sequences, and the church climax heightens the story's tension and stakes.",

While the action sequences and pacing are engaging, the romantic subplot detracts from the main story and feels unnecessary. Despite this, the stakes remain high, and the survival of Letty and Hawk adds a satisfying resolution.",

Everything about it felt very bland.  \n  - I know it was supposed to be scary, but it didn’t achieve that effect for me.  \n\n- **Moral/Philosophical Stance:**  \n  - I’ve always been firmly in the camp of the \"idjits\" who were behind this whole plot.  \n  - I have no issue with the idea of killing off humanity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, particularly Letty and Lucas, the plot fell flat for me. It lacked the intended suspense and felt bland overall. Despite this, I found myself aligning with the controversial moral stance presented in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative evolves from a standard chase-after-the-villain plot to a more nuanced exploration of ethical dilemmas.",

The themes of environmental collapse and human responsibility are timely and well-executed, making it a worthwhile read for fans of suspense and speculative fiction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

For instance, I was unsure why potentially contaminated individuals were not provided with masks, antiviral soap, clean clothes, or why their possibly contaminated belongings like clothes and computers were not taken away. Additionally, I was curious whether the measles vaccination would offer partial immunity in the context of the story.  \n\n- **Political Themes and Interpretation:**  \n  I did not understand why some readers perceived this as a \"lefty\" book. In my view, the left-leaning characters were portrayed as the truly evil \"bad guys,\" which contradicted that interpretation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a good pace and kept me engaged, the medical details felt inconsistent and raised questions. The political themes were also misunderstood by some readers, as the portrayal of the \"left\" as the antagonists did not align with the idea of it being a left-leaning book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The only connection to the Prey series was the inclusion of characters Letty and Lucas Davenport.  \n\n- **Plot and Drama:**  \n  The story lacked the intense drama and detective urgency that I expected, especially given the title and its association with the Prey series.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Value:**  \n  It was a good, easy read, and I’m glad I read it. However, I’m also glad I didn’t purchase it, as it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was an enjoyable and easy read, it fell short of the expectations set by its title and connection to the Prey series. The lack of drama and detective urgency made it less compelling, though it was still worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Lucas Davenport, the usual protagonist, is relegated to a supporting role, which feels unnecessary.  \n   - Lucas doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the case; his involvement could have been replaced by a new character without altering the story.  \n   - If this were a reader’s first introduction to Lucas, they’d likely wonder why he’s such a celebrated character.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n   - The story leans heavily into spy elements rather than the investigative focus typical of the Prey series.  \n   - The plot feels improbable, especially with Letty, Lucas, and their crew being tasked with saving the world without the full weight of the U.S. government behind them.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing is off compared to Sandford’s usual style. His books typically start slow but build momentum, making them hard to put down. This one, however, felt sluggish and required effort to continue reading.  \n   - It took four days to finish, which is unusual for a Sandford book, as his works are usually devoured in two days or less.  \n\n- **Originality and Similarities to Other Works:**  \n   - The plot bears striking similarities to Dan Brown’s *Inferno* (2013), featuring a noble virus spreader aiming to save the world by reducing the population.  \n   - There’s a lack of new twists or fresh ideas to distinguish this story from Brown’s work, making it feel derivative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This is the first John Sandford book I’ve disliked after enjoying over 50 of his works.  \n   - While every author is entitled to a “clunker,” I don’t recommend this one and can’t give it more than 2 stars.  \n   - I’d suggest starting the Prey Series from the beginning instead, as it’s consistently excellent.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Toxic Prey* is a disappointing entry in John Sandford’s otherwise stellar catalog. The shift in focus from Lucas Davenport to Letty, the improbable plot, sluggish pacing, and lack of originality make it my least favorite Sandford book.

            "*Toxic Prey* presents a shallow and clichéd narrative that relies heavily on improbable coincidences and illogical plot developments. The antagonists are poorly developed, making decisions that seem contrived to advance the story rather than reflect believable motives. The plot stretches the limits of suspension of disbelief, rendering it unengaging and tedious. Far-fetched scenarios abound, such as deciphering a password from a poster, undermining the credibility of the investigation. Mastermind criminals repeatedly make foolish choices, squandering opportunities to spread the virus effectively. Additionally, implausible coincidences, like recognizing someone in a grocery store and incorrectly inferring they have enough food for four people, detract from the realism. The characters display a reckless disregard for life, opting to kill indiscriminately instead of seeking non-lethal solutions.",

Moreover, the interactions between the characters are unrealistic, as both good and bad guys appear to anticipate each other's thoughts, often using the same phrases.",

It lacked the believability, character depth, and polished writing that I have come to expect from his novels. The rushed treatment and uneven pacing made it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise had potential, the execution fell short due to unrealistic plot elements, underdeveloped characters, and uneven pacing. The abrupt ending further compounded my dissatisfaction. As a longtime reader of Sandford's work, this novel did not meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed, the characters lacked development and meaningful interactions, and the abrupt ending left me unsatisfied. It did not live up to my expectations, and I would not consider it one of the better books I've read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

This made the narrative feel slow and tedious, and I eventually got bored.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I didn’t enjoy Letty and Lucas together as a team. It felt unrealistic that Letty couldn’t work without her dad checking on her, which made their dynamic less compelling.  \n\n- **Setting and Familiarity:**  \n  I live in New Mexico, so I always enjoy reading about places I’m familiar with. This aspect added a personal connection to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  I was disappointed in this outing.
