            "The story starts abruptly, thrusting me into the action without any setup, which gives it a novella-like feel rather than that of a full-length novel.

Much of the action arises from questionable decisions made by characters both inside and outside the library, which strained my suspension of disbelief. For instance, several characters venture out despite knowing the danger, and the town government's ineptitude—such as failing to bring supplies—feels contrived. Although the story has many strong elements, it might have been more effective as a novella. The enjoyable scene of Mad reading *The Silent Queen* to the kids, while charming, adds to the novel's length and slows the pacing. Over time, the waiting and tension in the library became somewhat tedious.",

            "The story centers on Mad, a chemist who returns to her hometown library, only to find herself trapped with a group of children and adults during an owl attack. Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters from a fantasy tale, *The Silent Queen*, which Mad reads to the children. While these chapters offer a tonal contrast to the main plot, they may not resonate with all readers. Although the book effectively weaves together various elements, the fantasy segments occasionally disrupt the momentum of the primary storyline.",

The side characters, including Nash, her love interest, and Farrah, her former best friend, are well-developed and engaging. The children in Mad's class are authentically portrayed, and their interactions with her add a heartwarming dimension to the story.",

The heightened stakes and captivating narrative kept me fully engaged throughout. I enjoyed immersing myself in this world so much that it’s already on my re-read list. While the ending was satisfying, I was still reluctant to leave behind these characters and their journey. It concluded well, but I could have happily stayed in this story much longer.",
            "I absolutely adored Mad from the outset. Her aversion to birds initially drew me in, but it was her entire character that truly resonated with me. She's faced significant challenges, hasn’t fully healed, and often shuts people out due to fear—all incredibly relatable traits. Mad's unexpected journey into teaching a group of teens, coupled with her entrapment in Bird Hell™, adds a unique twist to the narrative.\n\nThe supporting townspeople and teens were equally well-developed. I particularly enjoyed the story-within-a-story approach, which offered valuable insights into their perspectives. The author skillfully employed this device to enrich our understanding of the characters, making the overall experience even more engaging.",

Sure, partly because she \"never liked birds,\" but beyond that, I just clicked with her whole character. She's been through some stuff, hasn't healed well, and shuts people out because she's scared—it's all very relatable. Mad finding herself teaching a bunch of teens wasn't what she expected, but neither was being trapped in Bird Hell™.  \n  The other townspeople and the group of teens were also well-developed. I loved how the story-within-a-story gave us insight into their perspectives, and the author did an amazing job using this device to deepen our understanding of the characters.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is exciting! I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next, how they would escape, and who would make it. The high stakes and compelling narrative kept me hooked. At the same time, I never wanted it to end. I enjoyed being in this world so much that it’s already on my re-read list.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Bird Hell™ was both terrifying and entertaining. It’s the kind of apocalypse I could see myself front and center in, and it’s not cute. Mad and the others trapped in the library were ill-equipped to handle it, which added to the tension and realism.\n\n- **Narrative Device (Story-within-a-Story):**  \n  I usually don’t like stories-within-stories, but this one worked brilliantly. Mad reading the story to the group was entertaining, and it fit seamlessly into the main plot. It also provided a clever way to explore the characters’ personalities and perspectives.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was appropriate and satisfying, but I was still sad to leave this world and these characters behind. It wrapped up well, but I could have stayed in this story for much longer.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a gem. From the relatable and well-developed characters to the thrilling plot and unique narrative device, it kept me engaged from start to finish.

            "I initially enjoyed the excerpts from *The Silent Queen*, but they quickly became distracting and detracted from the present-day storyline. The pacing occasionally dragged, and the narrative felt repetitive, particularly during Mad’s internal monologues. Additionally, the romance involving Mad’s crush on the eldest brother of a school shooting victim felt unnecessary and did not contribute to the plot or advance the story.",

The secondary narrative, *The Silent Queen*, contributed to the uneven pacing, with some chapters lacking engagement. The main plot, triggered by an owl crashing through a window, centers on modern and fantastical survival, drawing a fitting comparison to *The Birds*. However, instead of evoking a strange and unsettling atmosphere, this story focuses on the realism of horror survival. While the premise intrigues, I wished for more of the eerie and inexplicable elements. The secondary story is interspersed through chapters from Mad's beloved childhood book.

            "In this engaging tale, we follow chemist Madigan Purdy (Mad) as she returns to her hometown, only to find herself trapped in a library with a group of middle schoolers during a harrowing owl attack. The narrative cleverly weaves together two threads: the intense, horror-filled siege in the library and the enchanting fantasy of The Silent Queen, which Mad reads to the children. This dual narrative structure is masterfully executed, with alternating chapters that sustain both tension and intrigue. The story leaves some mysteries unresolved, enhancing its cryptic atmosphere and perfectly complementing the overall tone.",
            "Mad is a well-crafted protagonist, characterized by her introversion, shyness, and deep loyalty to the children she cares for. Her compelling growth throughout the story is marked by her confrontation of past traumas and insecurities. Similarly, Queen Alala, the lead in The Silent Queen, is an intriguing character, though her background remains intentionally vague to avoid spoilers. The supporting characters, including the teens and Nash, serve their purpose well and enrich the narrative, complemented by a subtle romantic subplot that adds depth to the overall story.",

While the dense prose and scientific anecdotes may challenge some readers, they enrich the narrative. The author skillfully balances horror, fantasy, and emotional depth, resulting in a captivating and immersive reading experience.",

The horror elements, marked by graphic scenes and the suffocating atmosphere of a besieged library, effectively heighten the sense of anxiety and tension. Throughout the narrative, readers experience a spectrum of emotions—from fear and sadness to hope and admiration for the characters’ resilience."

            "This novel masterfully explores profound themes such as grief, regret, anger, violence, abandonment, loneliness, helplessness, and trauma. It examines the struggle of losing, regaining, and utilizing one’s voice, alongside concepts of responsibility, blame, and sacrifice. The emotional depth of the story moved me to tears, allowing me to forge a strong connection with the characters and their journeys. The titular parliament of owls serves as a multifaceted symbol, representing both a fantastical council of judgment and darker underworldly elements. Their duality—peaceful by day and chaotic by night—mirrors the novel’s exploration of terror as an inherent part of life. Additionally, the inclusion of body horror and disability representation adds further complexity to the narrative.",
            "The novel is marketed as a fantasy, but it’s better described as magical realism infused with dark philosophical themes and horror elements. The promotional comparison of \"The Birds\" to \"The Princess Bride\" oversimplifies the narrative, failing to capture its depth and complexity."

        "conclusion": "*The Parliament* is a masterful work of magical realism that transcends its marketing as a fantasy novel. With its sweeping prose, deeply emotional themes, and rich symbolism, the story immerses readers in a world where terror and beauty coexist. It is a profoundly moving exploration of grief, voice, and survival, delivered with a deft hand and an unflinching gaze at the darker aspects of life.",

The story centers around Mad, a trained chemist who returns to her hometown and is haunted by childhood memories and guilt. The plot takes a thrilling turn when a parliament of owls attacks the library where she is conducting a workshop, trapping her and others inside.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  While the book starts strong with a tense and engaging setup, the inclusion of a separate storyline (a book within the book) feels unnecessary and disjointed. This subplot, read by the main character to the children, doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the main narrative and detracts from the pacing, making the book feel longer than it needed to be.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The reviewer hoped the book-within-a-book might serve as a metaphor for deeper themes like capitalism or the struggles women face in their journey to womanhood. However, it falls short of delivering such complexity, leaving the reader disappointed by its lack of cleverness or meaningful commentary.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are underdeveloped and lack depth, making it difficult for the reader to connect with or care about them. This lack of fleshing out diminishes the emotional impact of the story.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book includes numerous dad jokes, which initially add a light-hearted tone but eventually become repetitive and grating, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The pacing suffers due to the inclusion of unnecessary elements, particularly the book-within-a-book. The reviewer feels the story could have been significantly shorter (by about 150 pages) without losing its core appeal.  \n\n- **Tension and Thrills:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book delivers some tense and thrilling scenes, particularly during the owl attack and the characters’ struggle to survive. These moments are highlights of the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Parliament* has an engaging premise and some thrilling moments, it is weighed down by unnecessary subplots, underdeveloped characters, and repetitive humor.

            "This book is tense and bizarre, provoking strong emotional reactions that range from disbelief to dread. The premise of thousands of owls descending on a library and trapping everyone inside creates a gripping and unique scenario. The stakes are high, with looming shortages of food, medication, and water, and the terrifying risk of being torn apart by the owls for anyone attempting to escape. The narrative alternates between the main plot and a story within the story, *The Silent Queen*, which the protagonist reads to the children. However, the lengthy chapters can make it challenging to re-engage when switching between the two narratives.",

Beyond horror, the story also addresses friendship, second chances, and collaboration in desperate situations.

            "The alternating chapters between the main murder-owl plot and the fantasy narrative disrupted the story's flow and pacing. Skipping the fantasy sections after the first 100 pages improved readability, as their inclusion felt unnecessary and distracting. While the idea of murderous owls swarming a public library was captivating, the lack of a logical explanation for their behavior diminished its impact. The local government's actions were often puzzling—such as supplying MREs instead of medications and attempting to use gas without considering human life. The resolution, where characters donned duct tape armor and used earplugs to distract the owls, felt anti-climactic and inconsistent with the owls' earlier behavior. Additionally, the romance between Mad and her crush seemed extraneous and contributed little to the overall narrative.",

            "The inclusion of a second storyline—a subversive fantasy novel read aloud to the kids—seemed unnecessary and disrupted the pacing. The book felt overly long, and removing this subplot could have enhanced its flow. While a connection between the two storylines existed, understanding it required effort, making it tempting to skim through the fantasy chapters. Additionally, the romance plot felt misplaced and detracted from the main narrative, while the male lead's humor came off as annoying, diminishing the overall experience.",

            "While I enjoyed the book overall, I found the pacing uneven, particularly between the graphic owl killings and the fairy tale elements. The story could have benefited from less fairy tale content and more action involving the adults and children trapped in the library. A quicker pace would have enhanced the experience, but it was still an enjoyable read.",

The story's premise—people trapped in a library while thousands of murderous owls wait outside, eager to peck them to death—is brilliant. It unfolds like an alternate fairy tale that explores themes of grief and moving on. The connection to the grief experienced by Mad Purdy in the main storyline adds depth to the narrative."

            "I have a soft spot for creature features, especially those where a group must unite to survive a disaster, so this story was right up my alley. It follows Madeleine, who returns to her hometown after a childhood trauma and ends up teaching a self-care chemistry course at the local library. When a mysterious parliament of murderous owls attacks, the visitors must band together to survive. \n\nThe plot is enriched by a story Mad reads to the children, titled *The Silent Queen*. Initially, I found it challenging to engage with this subplot, but as its themes began to intertwine with the library's chaos, I became fully invested. The author skillfully balances the two narratives, enhancing the overall depth of the story. While Mad's reluctance to reconnect with her hometown felt somewhat forced at first, the emotional resolution by the end made it worthwhile.",
            "Mad's character, marked by her stilted awkwardness and evolving interactions with her students, resonated deeply with me as a teacher. Her journey from reluctant involvement to fostering a strong sense of trust with the children was compelling. I particularly appreciated her struggle to navigate the trauma of witnessing her childhood friend's death in a school shooting, coupled with her feelings of helplessness in protecting her students. While the rekindled romance between Mad and Nash, the local pediatrician and her former love interest, sometimes felt a bit forced, the emotional arc ultimately captivated me.",
            "This book skillfully balances the horrific violence of the owl attacks with the tender moments of adults and children uniting to protect and care for one another. The theme of preemptive grief, along with the adults' struggle to safeguard the vulnerable despite knowing they may not always succeed, is profoundly moving. As someone who works with children, I found this particularly resonant."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book was a big surprise for me, as I stumbled upon it accidentally, but I am so glad I read it! The blend of horror, emotional depth, and themes of protection and vulnerability made it a standout read. Despite some minor pacing and character development issues, the story had me fully invested and even brought me to tears by the end.",

The book ran lengthy, and removing this subplot could have enhanced its overall flow. Although the two storylines are linked, the fantasy chapters necessitated slow, deliberate reading to grasp their connections, which could be frustrating at times.",

This approach would have been more effective as two separate novellas. The urgency in the plot stemmed largely from the characters' ineptitude, which, while resonant in a post-pandemic context, felt exaggerated. Additionally, the ending left much to be desired.",

Her geeky inner dialogue and insightful science commentary added depth to her character. Despite facing overwhelming challenges, she consistently prioritized the well-being of the children in her care, showcasing her selflessness. The diverse backgrounds of the students and their individual growth were well-executed. However, the numerous side characters lacked development, often falling into stereotypes, which detracted from the overall narrative. I found myself needing a list to keep track of them, which made their presence feel more cumbersome than enriching.",

I appreciated her geeky inner dialogue and science commentary. Despite having every reason to be selfish given the situation, she chose to do her best for the children put in her care.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The mix of student backgrounds (race, gender identity, etc.) and their individual growths were well-done. However, the large number of side characters without any development was a drawback. I had to keep a list to keep them straight, and they were largely just stereotypes that made things worse for everyone.\n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The exploration of trauma was compelling. The dark, feminist fairytales and the concept of \"murder owls\" added unique layers to the story.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story-within-a-story outline didn’t work well in this case. The tension of the main story was cut every time we jumped to the fairytale, and the two stories never really informed each other, making it feel confusingly out of place. This would have worked better as two separate novellas.\n\n- **Pacing and Urgency:**  \n  The urgency in the plot was largely driven by the ineptitude of other human beings. While this resonated in a \"post\"-pandemic world, it still felt over the top.\n\n- **Tone and Audience:**  \n  I could never really nail down the age of the audience this was intended for. The fairytale felt YA; Mad is in her 30s with casual mentions of sex and weed, which leans toward Adult, but the jokes and middle school characters often made the vibe feel Middle Grade.\n\n- **Humor:**  \n  The prevalence of dad jokes, though meant for the benefit of the middle school characters, felt excessive.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Without spoiling, I felt the ending was lacking.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a mix of elements that worked and didn’t work for me.

While there are aspects I would personally change, the fictional book feels organic and purposeful, enhancing the overall narrative without feeling forced.  \n\n- **Character Differentiation:**  \n  One minor issue is that it can sometimes be challenging to differentiate between characters due to the large number of people trapped in the library.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Story-within-a-Story (\"The Silent Queen\")**:  \n   - The fairy tale \"The Silent Queen\" was beautifully written, dark, tragic, emotional, and colorful.  \n   - I loved Alala and the other characters in this story.  \n   - I wished it had been published separately and developed further, as I would have enjoyed reading it on its own.  \n\n- **Main Story (Library with Homicidal Owls)**:  \n   - The premise of being trapped in a library with homicidal owls outside felt unoriginal and overdone.  \n   - I couldn’t connect with the main story because it felt too similar to other works I’ve encountered (minus the owls).  \n   - The writing was bland, and the characters felt generic, resembling those from countless other bestsellers.  \n   - I found myself bored, exasperated, and scared simultaneously, but I didn’t care about most of the trapped characters except for the kids, who were nice.  \n   - The use of the \"characters reading a book within the book\" plot device felt forced and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Humor (Nash’s Jokes)**:  \n   - Nash’s bad jokes were a highlight of the owls part of the story.  \n   - Examples: “When do you go to the dentist? Tooth-hurty!” and “Want to hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it’s too cheesy.”  \n   - I found them amusing and enjoyed them.  \n\n- **Ending**:  \n   - I was pleased with both endings (the fairy tale and the main story).  \n   - The book unexpectedly served as a Halloween read for me, which was unusual but enjoyable.  \n\n- **Overall Experience**:  \n   - Despite my criticisms, I kept turning the pages because the concept of murder owls was genuinely scary.  \n   - I appreciated the opportunity to read the book, thanks to NetGalley and the publisher.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I adored the fairy tale \"The Silent Queen\" and wished it had been expanded into its own book, the main story about the library and homicidal owls felt unoriginal and lacked depth. The bland writing and generic characters made it hard to connect, though Nash’s humor and the scary premise kept me engaged. The endings were satisfying, and the book turned out to be an unexpected Halloween read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story is intense and nearly impossible to put down, with a plot that keeps readers hooked until the very end. The inclusion of a story within a story—Mad reading *The Snow Queen* to the children—adds depth and interweaves themes of adventure, loss, and female empowerment into the main narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are wonderfully developed, with each undergoing significant evolution throughout the story.

The diverse array of patrons trapped in the library, from the \"good old boys\" to the wedding-obsessed couple, adds richness to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores profound themes such as self-examination of one’s strengths in times of crisis, the power of knowledge (especially in a setting devoid of phones or internet), and the resilience of the human spirit. The library, as a setting, becomes a symbol of containment and empowerment, housing both the physical and intellectual tools for survival.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Craft:**  \n  The author, Pokwatka, masterfully crafts a story that is both gripping and thought-provoking.

The thematic exploration of trauma and resilience is compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I mostly liked the romance subplot, though I had one minor issue with it.

The character and thematic resolution in the ending were satisfying and what I truly cared about.  \n\n- **Book-within-a-Book Element:**  \n  I strongly disliked this aspect of the novel. It felt too on-the-nose, uninteresting, and poorly written compared to the rest of the book. It added nothing to the main narrative, and I seriously considered skipping it entirely.

Even when I was frustrated by their choices, I felt they were exactly what someone might think or do in that situation.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Interconnected Stories:**  \n  The secondary story came as a surprise, as this book feels like two books in one. However, the stories are not isolated; they influence each other deeply. The Silent Queen (the secondary story) impacted the behavior of the primary story characters, and the novel-within-a-novel reflected the themes of the real-time story. The structure reminded me of a caduceus, with the stories winding around each other as they built toward the climax.  \n\n- **Themes of Trauma and Grief:**  \n  The themes of trauma and grief were woven throughout both stories, portrayed in both heartwrenching and healing ways. The emotional weight of these themes kept me deeply engaged, especially in the final quarter of the book. I was glued to my screen, arms wrapped around myself, unsure of how things would resolve. The story offered no promises or guarantees, and the presence of tragedy—both past and present, in both the primary and secondary worlds—made it feel like any ending was possible. Nothing felt safe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel captivated me with its relatable characters, intricate narrative structure, and profound exploration of trauma and grief.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I was so excited about this book and thought the premise was unique and exciting. The idea of a story within a story, particularly the 'Silent Queen' book that the main character reads, was intriguing, though I later found it divisive for my personal taste.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  I loved the writing of the main story. The ominous tone, the sense of dread, and the gore were all compelling. The slice-of-life elements, such as watching the characters navigate their relationships and figure out what to do while being stuck together, added depth and relatability.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure (Books within Books):**  \n  The interspersed 'Silent Queen' chapters were a struggle for me. Knowing it was a children's book the main character had read growing up, and given my general difficulty with YA/Children's literature, I should have anticipated this issue. The 'Silent Queen' sections felt far outside my preferred style, bogging down my reading experience. I often found myself putting the book down during these chapters and wanting to skim or skip them entirely.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Interpersonal Stories:**  \n  The little interpersonal stories that emerged from the characters being stuck together—family, exes, friends, and strangers—were a highlight. These moments added richness to the narrative and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Target Audience:**  \n  While only one half of the story resonated with me, I believe this book will find its readers. Many will likely enjoy both aspects of the story, but for me, the 'Silent Queen' sections detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a lot to offer, with a unique premise, strong writing, and compelling character dynamics. However, the inclusion of the 'Silent Queen' chapters, which didn't align with my reading preferences, made the experience uneven for me.

The idea of murder owls descending upon a local library and trapping everyone inside was intriguing and immediately drew me in.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There were too many characters, making it difficult to keep track of them or form emotional attachments.

I had hoped for a more creative use of the library's resources, akin to *From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler*. Instead, the focus shifted away from the setting to other elements of the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The shared trauma between the main character and her love interest was well-executed and tied into broader themes of PTSD, overcoming fear, moving forward in life, and the importance of community.

As a result, both narratives seem like separate books, diminishing their overall impact.

I wanted to stay immersed in the library setting, feeling the tension build as the characters faced the threat of the owls. However, the frequent interruptions by the fairy tale disrupted this immersion. I craved more background on the characters trapped in the library and more context about the owls—their origins, motivations, and the cause of their behavior.  \n\n- **Engagement with the Fairy Tale:**  \n  The fairy tale, while intriguing at first, was hard to follow due to its complexity and the sheer number of characters. I found it difficult to care about this secondary story, especially when it pulled me away from the horror narrative I was more invested in. The lack of clarity about its relevance to the main story further diminished my interest.  \n\n- **Pacing and Flow:**  \n  The stark and frequent shifts between the two stories disrupted the pacing and flow of the novel. The transitions felt abrupt, making it hard to stay engaged with either narrative. I would have preferred a more cohesive structure that allowed the horror story to develop fully without interruptions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the horror story had potential with its suspenseful premise and eerie setting, the novel’s disjointed structure and lack of connection between the two narratives made it a frustrating read. The constant shifts between the horror and fairy tale disrupted the flow and left me wanting more from the main story. Ultimately, I would not recommend this book due to its confusing and unsatisfying narrative approach.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This book consists of two main narratives: a contemporary tale of individuals trapped in a library and a fairy tale from the protagonist's childhood that she shares with children for distraction. The structure alternates between these storylines, initially featuring two present-day chapters followed by a fairy tale chapter, before shifting to a more consistent alternating format. I found both narratives compelling and appreciated the parallels the author skillfully wove between them. The ending was thrilling and fast-paced, making it difficult to put the book down and keeping me fully engaged.",

However, her recurring fear that everyone would hate her for not actually holding Hollis' hand as he died became somewhat repetitive and, at times, frustrating. This could reflect a lack of empathy on my part, though.",

To me, it feels more like a story about trauma and grief with added horror elements. The \"murder owls\" are terrifying and creative, but they aren't the main focus of the book.  \n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**  \n  - The book is divided into two main parts: the present-day story of people trapped in a library and a fairy tale from the main character's youth, which she reads to the kids as a distraction. The structure alternates between these two narratives, sometimes with two \"now\" chapters followed by one fairy tale chapter, and later shifting to alternating every other chapter. I enjoyed both storylines and appreciated the parallels the author drew between them.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I liked Mad as the main character. Her awkwardness and coping mechanisms felt authentic and relatable. However, I found her recurring fear—that everyone would hate her if they knew she wasn't actually holding Hollis' hand as he died—to be a bit repetitive and annoying. This might just be a lack of empathy on my part, though.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Engagement:**  \n  - The ending was action-packed, exciting, and hard to put down. It kept me thoroughly engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I would definitely recommend this book, but if you're looking for a straightforward horror novel, you might want to have another book on standby.

As someone who isn’t a big horror fan, I found the balance to be perfect.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The cast of characters is fascinating, especially Mad, who stands out as a compelling protagonist.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Creativity:**  \n  - I loved the inclusion of a book within a book—*The Silent Queen*—which Mad reads to distract the children in the library. This added layer of storytelling felt very original and engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting:**  \n  - Stories with deeper meaning always resonate with me, and this one delivered on that front.  \n  - The library setting was a delightful touch and added to the overall charm of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable and original read that combined thrilling action, fantasy, and a touch of horror in a way that felt perfectly balanced. The inclusion of *The Silent Queen* as a story within the story added depth and creativity, while the library setting and meaningful themes made it even more memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to @netgalley and @torbooks for providing the early copy."

The story also delves into the protagonist's unresolved trauma from witnessing a school shooting as a preteen. Despite the dual storylines—one involving the bird attacks and the other exploring the protagonist's past—the narrative maintains a balanced pace, ensuring neither storyline overwhelms the reader.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book successfully keeps the reader engaged with its well-structured intrigue. The interplay between the two storylines is handled skillfully, avoiding any sense of being bogged down or disjointed.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  If you found Daphne DuMaurier's novella *The Birds* frightening, this novel might not be for you. However, it offers a fresh take on the concept of bird attacks, which could appeal to fans of the genre.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the intense themes, I remain a fan of raptors, even after reading about the attacking owls.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel masterfully weaves together a gripping plot about bird attacks with a deeply personal exploration of trauma. The dual storylines are balanced and engaging, making it a compelling read. While it may not suit those who found *The Birds* too frightening, it offers a fresh and intriguing perspective on the theme.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book features two stories, *The Silent Queen* and *The Parliament*. The main plot follows Mad, who is teaching kids how to make bath bombs at the library when an owl crashes through the window, triggering a survival story against murderous owls. The narrative is intense, filled with suspense, particularly when the group devises a plan to escape by dispersing to confuse their attackers. The pacing is well-balanced, alternating between calm moments, like bath bomb-making, and high-stakes survival scenes. The tension escalates effectively during the escape, keeping me engaged with the uncertainty of the characters' fates. The ending is satisfying, as Mad and Nash survive, despite Nash losing an eye. Mad's decision to give their relationship another chance adds a sense of closure and hope for their future.",

Her guilt over the media's portrayal of this tragedy adds depth to her persona. Nash plays a pivotal role in Mad's life, and their rekindled attraction brings emotional resonance to the narrative. Additionally, the children in the library form meaningful connections, each revealing their own traumas—such as Harper’s poignant story about her brother’s death—which further enriches their characters.",
