I knew this would be my type of read the second it crossed my Goodreads feed, and boy, was I right. It has everything I love: a cozy small-town setting, hilarious characters, a mystery, and VAMPIRES!!! Vampires make everything better, let me tell you.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I highly recommend the audiobook because the narrator is brilliant and perfectly brought all the characters to life, giving them each a unique voice. It was such an amazing experience listening to this, and I'd do it again!!  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot was giving *Supernatural* vibes, with the whole \"saving people, hunting things (strigoi), the family business,\" except the Evans women don't have to leave their backyard to do it!  \n\n- **Character Development and Impact:**  \n  I was surprised at which characters died—some were actually really important—but the author wasn't shy about doing away with them. It hurts a little, not gonna lie. So when you start this, be warned: no one is safe.  \n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n  The ending was so good and made me so excited for the next book...which isn't coming for another year. Do you think I can wait that long??? Huh, do you???  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  While looking for the author's newsletter, I found out that THIS BOOK/SERIES IS GETTING TURNED INTO A TV SHOW AAAAAH!!!!!! Which is honestly just perfect because I can imagine it like a mix of *True Blood* and *Supernatural*, but still with its own twist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight, combining a cozy small-town setting, hilarious characters, a gripping mystery, and vampires into a story that kept me hooked from start to finish. The audiobook narration was phenomenal, and the plot had a *Supernatural* vibe with its own unique twist.

Grace, Lenore’s daughter, fiercely protects her own daughter, Luna, fully aware of the world's dangers.

However, my favorite character is Ducey Evans, Luna’s great-grandmother, whose acerbic wit and iconic presence (complete with butterscotch clacking against her dentures) made her unforgettable.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book gave me strong \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" vibes, with vampires more reminiscent of Anne Rice’s style than Twilight. The gore level is high at times, adding to the dark and thrilling tone.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I absolutely loved this book. The Evans women were wonderfully written, and I would love to read more about their stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of dark humor, family dynamics, and supernatural elements. The Evans women are a delight, and the story’s setting and tone make it a perfect Halloween read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the pacing felt slow at times, the story eventually captivated me. The multiple POVs were handled well, though the lack of a clear protagonist left me questioning who the true hero was. The fresh take on vampire lore and the family’s mysterious mission added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Set in Southeast Texas in 1999, the story follows three generations of Evans women who run the town's only funeral parlor. The plot centers on the arrival of the dead, who rise as flesh-hungry Strigoi.

            "The ending is both shocking and unexpected, filled with thrilling yet heartbreaking moments that leave me eager for more. The story centers on the Evans women, who manage a funeral parlor and are tasked with preventing the undead from rising. As the body count increases, they must confront a haunting past event known as the Godawful Mess. Additionally, the mystery surrounding Luna and her father adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.",
            "The characters are a standout feature of the story, especially the memorable Evans women. Ducey, the 84-year-old matriarch, shines with her witty remarks and sage advice. Lenore, Grace, and Luna each face their own struggles and mysteries, enriching the family dynamic. Side characters like Deputy Roger Taylor, Crane, and Sheriff Buck Johnson further enhance the narrative, with Sheriff Johnson being a somewhat unlikable yet endearing figure, thanks to his affection for his dog, Belle.",
            "The world-building is somewhat confusing due to the complex rules governing the strigoi and their operations. While the author's detailed descriptions of the strigoi and their violent nature are a strength, they also contribute to the overall confusion.",
            "This novel skillfully merges Southern charm with graphic violence, resulting in a distinctive blend of humor and horror. While the story offers an entertaining take on the horror genre, it is filled with vivid depictions of bloodshed. The cover may imply a lighter tone, but the content is far more intense and bloody than one might anticipate."

While the world-building can be confusing and the tone occasionally shifts to a more serious note, the novel remains a memorable and enjoyable read.

This unique premise distinguishes the story from my usual reads, and while it was occasionally creepy and unsettling, I was hooked from the beginning.",

            "This captivating story revolves around the Evans women—Ducey, Lenore, Grace, and Luna—and their complex family life, tied to a haunting past event known as *The God Awful Mess* and their history of vampire hunting. The well-crafted plot is emotionally intense, often keeping me reading well into the night. The author’s storytelling approach is engaging, with each chapter offering a different perspective from a family member, law enforcement officer, or victim, revealing their unique emotions and insights. Ducey, Lenore, and Grace's chapters are straightforward, illustrating their roles in the funeral parlor and vampire hunting while reflecting on the impact of *The God Awful Incident*. In contrast, Luna’s chapters begin lightheartedly but take a darker turn as she uncovers family secrets. The law enforcement chapters convey their confusion and theories, while the victims’ narratives are heart-wrenching, depicting ordinary lives abruptly cut short.",

The horror elements were effectively executed, with increasingly gruesome scenes that nearly unsettled me, despite my usual resilience to gore. The mystery aspect was compelling, particularly the surprising identity of the master vampire and Luna's connection to it. The shocking revelation of *The God Awful Incident* added an unexpected twist regarding Luna, and I appreciated being misled about the master vampire's identity. Overall, the book delivered a captivating blend of horror and mystery."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Interest and Expectations:**\n   - I was drawn to *Bless Your Heart* by its cover and blurb, which intrigued me with its premise of women funeral parlor owners who are also vampire hunters. I wanted to see if I could connect with the characters and if the storyline would hold my interest.\n\n- **Storyline and Plot:**\n   - The main storyline was captivating and kept me glued to the book. It revolves around the Evans women (Ducey, Lenore, Grace, and Luna), their family life, a past event called *The God Awful Mess*, and their history with vampire hunting. The plot was well-written and emotionally intense, often keeping me up late to read more.\n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**\n   - The author’s storytelling approach was fascinating. Each chapter focused on a different family member, law enforcement officer, or victim, providing insight into their perspectives and emotions. Ducey, Lenore, and Grace’s chapters were straightforward, showcasing their roles in the funeral parlor and vampire hunting, while also revealing how *The God Awful Incident* impacted them. Luna’s chapters started lighthearted but turned dark as she discovered the family’s secret. The law enforcement chapters highlighted their confusion and theories, and the victims’ chapters were heartbreaking, as they depicted ordinary people going about their lives before being killed.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The Evans women were unique and well-developed, each with distinct personalities that shone through. Despite their dysfunction following *The God Awful Incident*, I admired how they came together to protect each other and Luna.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**\n   - The horror aspect was executed effectively. The scenes became increasingly gruesome, with blood and gore escalating as the story progressed. While I’m not easily grossed out, this book came close to unsettling me.\n\n- **Mystery and Revelations:**\n   - The mystery angle was compelling. I was surprised by the identity of the master vampire and Luna’s connection to it. The revelation of *The God Awful Incident* was shocking and tied into a surprising twist about Luna. I initially suspected someone else as the master vampire and was pleased to be proven wrong.\n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**\n   - The ending was heartbreaking, especially due to the deaths of main characters. However, it also offered a glimmer of hope, leaving me eager to read the next book in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Bless Your Heart* is a gripping, well-crafted novel that combines horror, mystery, and family drama. The unique premise, strong character development, and emotional depth kept me engaged throughout. While the ending was bittersweet, it left me excited for the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

When two locals unexpectedly rise from the grave, the Evans women reveal long-held family secrets to Luna, the youngest member. The final third of the book is action-packed, though the conclusion feels somewhat rushed, and the 'big reveal' is predictable yet still entertaining.",

While Luna emerges as the main character, the multi-POV structure makes it challenging to form a deep connection with any one character.

However, it effectively provides a broader view of the town and its interconnectedness.  \n   - Since this is the first in a series, I expect more character development in future books.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The narrator, Stephanie Nemeth Parker, was excellent, giving each character a distinct voice.  \n   - Some characters have annoying habits (e.g., smacking lips), which the narrator performed so well that it elicited involuntary twitches from me.  \n\n- **Content and Warnings:**  \n   - The book contains a lot of gore, blood, violent death, dismemberment, and other graphic elements, which may not be suitable for squeamish readers.  \n   - Additional content warnings include death of a child (teen), references to the Columbine school shooting, homophobic slurs, racism, and injury to an animal (dog).  \n   - For those with misophonia, the mouth noises in the audiobook may be particularly cringe-inducing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Bless Your Heart* is a fun, nostalgic, and gory mystery-horror novel with Southern charm and a unique take on the undead.

            "This story is captivating and riveting, infused with a strong sense of urgency that kept me eagerly listening. Set in a small Texas town in the 90s, the authentic atmosphere is enhanced by the close-knit community and their shared secrets. The balance of darkness and light humor creates a cozy horror vibe rather than a traditional horror narrative. The murders occur mostly off-screen, with graphic descriptions limited to the aftermath, which is mercifully brief and not overly gruesome. My only critique is the underdeveloped backstory of the Strigoi, especially considering the Evans family's long history of battling them.",

Ducey, the eldest, and Luna, the youngest, stood out as personal favorites, but all the women in the family were well-developed and engaging. Lenore and Grace initially seemed confusing but grew more distinctive as the story unfolded. Secondary characters, such as Deputy Roger Taylor and Luna’s friends Crystal and Dylan, contributed depth and humor, enriching the overall narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The audiobook was delightfully fun, and the narrator, Stephanie Nemith-Parker, did an excellent job.  \n   - She brought the characters to life with distinct voices, a convincing Southern accent, and conveyed emotions effectively.  \n   - Handling multiple points of view seemed effortless for her.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The Evans family is tight-knit, brave, and tough, with a realistic and wonderful family dynamic.  \n   - Ducey (the oldest) and Luna (the youngest) were personal favorites, but all the women in the family were well-developed and enjoyable.  \n   - Lenore and Grace were initially confusing but became more distinctive as the story progressed.  \n   - Secondary characters like Deputy Roger Taylor and Luna’s friends, Crystal and Dylan, added depth and humor to the story.  \n\n- **Story and Plot:**  \n   - The story is captivating and riveting, with a strong sense of urgency that made me eager to keep listening.  \n   - Set in a small Texas town in the 90s, the setting feels authentic, with everyone knowing each other and their secrets.  \n   - The balance between darkness and light humor is well-executed, making it more of a \"cozy horror\" than a traditional horror novel.  \n   - The murders are mostly off-screen, with graphic descriptions limited to the aftermath, which felt mercifully short and not overly gruesome.  \n   - The only critique is the lack of backstory about the Strigoi, which felt underdeveloped given the Evans family’s long history of fighting them.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n   - While marketed as horror, the book leans more toward cozy horror with a mix of humor and heart.  \n   - The running thread of darkness is balanced by light moments, making it accessible and enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis audiobook is a delightful blend of humor, heart, and light horror, with a captivating story and well-developed characters. The narrator’s performance enhances the experience, making it a highly enjoyable listen. Despite a minor critique about the Strigoi’s backstory, the book is engaging and leaves me excited for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall enjoyment: Highly recommended.  \n- Narration: Excellent.  \n- Story: Riveting and well-balanced.  \n- Character development: Strong and realistic.  \n- World-building: Authentic setting, though the Strigoi’s history could be expanded."

The mystery surrounding the original vampire adds an intriguing layer to the plot. I found the premise highly entertaining and appreciated its potential for further development.",

This was fine with me, as I have a strong background in horror from my teen years, reading authors like Clive Barker and Leigh Nichols (Dean Koontz pseudonym) and watching films like *Nightmare on Elm Street*.  \n\n- **Mythological Integration:**  \n  The book is based on Romanian mythology surrounding the Strigoi, which are a mix between vampires and zombies. I appreciated how the author, Lindy Ryan, blended this centuries-old mythology into a modern story. She clearly did her research, as elements like the beheading and placing the head face down were included, though some traditional traits like invisibility and shapeshifting were omitted.  \n\n- **Narration Performance:**  \n  This was my first time listening to a book narrated by Stephanie Németh Parker. Overall, she did a good job, though some characters came across as annoying. For example, the coroner’s constant lip-smacking, which the narrator included in her performance, became grating over time. I’m unsure if this was due to the narration or how the character was written.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n  The ending of the book hints at the possibility of a sequel, which I would definitely look forward to reading or listening to.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre and Theme:**\n   - This book is a fun horror twist on a family saga, blending small-town dynamics with supernatural elements.\n   - The story is set in a small Texas town in 1999 and revolves around four generations of Evans women who run a funeral parlor and secretly combat vampires (strigoi).\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot kicks off when a \"customer\" unexpectedly comes back to life during funeral preparations, signaling the end of a long lull in vampire activity.\n   - The story is propelled by multiple POVs, which provide glimpses of scary events happening away from the main characters.\n   - The pacing is engaging, with the author skillfully hiding just enough information to keep the reader intrigued without feeling repetitive or bored.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The main cast includes Ducey (the 80-year-old matriarch), her daughter Lenore, Lenore's daughter Grace, and Grace's 15-year-old daughter Luna.\n   - While the multiple POVs add depth, I felt a stronger connection to the main characters could have been achieved with a slightly longer book and more wrap-up at the end.\n   - The inclusion of a police POV adds a mystery element alongside the horror and main character perspectives.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**\n   - The body horror and gore descriptions are well-executed and delivered a satisfying level of creepiness.\n   - The horror victim scenes are effectively balanced with the main characters' experiences, enhancing the overall tension.\n\n- **Series Potential:**\n   - This is the first book in a series, and while it sets up an intriguing premise, I wanted more resolution and character reactions to the major events at the end.\n   - Despite this, I am definitely interested in continuing the series.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**\n   - Fans of *The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires* might enjoy this book, though it leans more toward action and less toward humor and character-driven storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a thrilling blend of family drama and horror, set in a vividly depicted small town with a supernatural twist. While the multiple POVs and well-crafted horror elements keep the story engaging, the character development and ending could have been more fleshed out. Nonetheless, it’s a strong start to a series that promises more excitement and intrigue.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.75 stars"

I listened to the audiobook at 2.0 speed, which suited me well.

It had a unique blend of eerie and fun elements that made it enjoyable.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The story is set in small-town Texas in the 90s, and it perfectly captures the vibes of that era, including homophobia, fear of goth kids, a creepy/rude old detective, gossip, and, of course, vampires.  \n  - However, the book relies heavily on the reader’s understanding of small-town Southern America, as the location isn’t deeply established beyond being named.  \n\n- **Characters and Themes:**  \n  - The vampires were a highlight—they weren’t the typical vampires but more like undead zombies who need blood to survive. It was a fresh and fun take on the trope.  \n  - The multiple POVs made it hard to get solid information about the vampires, and some of these perspectives could have been removed for better cohesion.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - While I enjoyed the book a lot, the pacing felt uneven due to the numerous POVs, which sometimes disrupted the flow and clarity of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I freaking loved this book! It was a creepy, fun, and unique read with a fresh take on vampires and a strong sense of 90s small-town Texas. Despite some flaws, like the reliance on the reader’s familiarity with Southern small towns and the overabundance of POVs, it was an enjoyable experience. I’m excited to see what else this author does in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While initially a bit confusing, the transitions between characters are handled effortlessly. The characterization is solid, though not deeply explored for every character due to the modest page length. None of the characters feel lacking or like cardboard cutouts.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The book is listed as the first in a series, but the ending wraps up neatly without a cliffhanger or obvious hanging threads. It works well as a standalone story, though there are points that could be expanded upon in future installments.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  This is a sweet, mostly cozy horror story that isn’t afraid to get messy.

Their dynamic was both authentic and endearing.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The relationships between the four generations of women (great-grandmother, grandmother, mother, and daughter) added not only humor but also a surprising amount of emotional warmth. This depth made the story more engaging and heartfelt.  \n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  The story is so vivid and well-crafted that I could easily see it being adapted into a movie. It has all the elements—humor, horror, and heart—that would translate well to the screen.  \n\n- **Narrative Complexity:**  \n  The only drawback was the large number of points of view (POVs) to follow, which occasionally made the story feel a bit confusing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Bless Your Heart* is a delightful blend of humor, horror, and heartfelt family dynamics, reminiscent of a 90s comedic horror movie. While the multiple POVs can be a bit overwhelming, the strong characters and emotional depth make it a memorable and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The use of multiple viewpoints effectively builds tension, gradually escalating the terror throughout the narrative. This technique keeps me engaged as the story pieces come together, leading to an explosive and satisfying resolution.

When the dead begin to rise and feed, the women, along with a few allies, must uncover the cause and find a way to stop it before chaos erupts and an even greater disaster unfolds.",

However, what I did learn about them, I enjoyed!  \n\n- **Climax and Plot Execution:**  \n  The climax felt a little muddled, and I wasn’t entirely sure what was happening at times or the logistics of it all.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Ryan writes some really gnarly, gross-out scenes, which I consider the highest of compliments!  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was a pretty fun read overall!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some pacing issues and a somewhat confusing climax, it was an enjoyable read with memorable moments, particularly the vivid and gross-out scenes. The Evans women were intriguing, though I wish I could have gotten to know them better.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

The cover and title were so intriguing that I decided to give it a chance without knowing much else about it.  \n\n- **Cultural and Personal Connection:**  \n  As someone from the South (even though I now live in Northern Virginia), I found myself relating to the frequent use of phrases like “bless your heart.” This added a personal touch to my reading experience.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  The family dynamics, particularly between the women, were one of the strongest aspects of the book. The mother-daughter and grandmother-granddaughter relationships among the Evans women were beautifully portrayed. Each woman had a unique relationship with her daughter and grandmother, and the author, Ms. Ryan, captured these struggles with great depth and authenticity.  \n\n- **Unique Concept of Vampires:**  \n  I appreciated the fresh take on vampires in this story. Instead of the typical portrayal seen in mainstream media, the author presented them as the restless dead. This unique perspective felt original and added an intriguing layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending Impact:**  \n  The ending was a standout moment for me. Without giving away any spoilers, it was so impactful that it truly made the book unforgettable. It left a lasting impression and elevated the entire story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, combining relatable family dynamics, a fresh take on vampires, and a powerful ending. The author’s ability to weave complex relationships and unique concepts into the story made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The story kicks off with the discovery of a mutilated body, heralding the return of a long-feared threat. While the central mystery drives the plot, the pacing is slow, with many chapters devoted to inaction and repeated reminders of the looming danger.

I guessed the identity of the Strigoi behind the first victim early on, which reduced the suspense.  \n\n- **Content and Suitability:**  \n  The book includes humor, strong language, and some violence, though it’s not overly graphic. This makes it suitable for readers aged 15 and up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Bless Your Heart* wasn’t the humorous vampire tale I expected, it offered an interesting blend of horror and paranormal elements. The characters were engaging, though occasionally confusing, and the Strigoi felt more like zombies than vampires. The plot had potential, but the lack of explanation for certain elements and the predictable mystery dampened my enjoyment. Overall, it’s a decent read with a mix of humor, language, and mild violence, suitable for older teens and up.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 Stars"

I approached it expecting campy horror with strong social commentary, reminiscent of Grady Hendrix’s style. This misalignment affected my enjoyment, though it’s unfair to judge the book on that basis.

The twist around the 70% mark felt obvious and could have been revealed earlier.  \n   - The resolution felt rushed because the twist wasn’t integrated sooner, leaving much of the book focused on waiting rather than action.  \n   - The undead issue could have been explored more deeply if the twist had been introduced earlier.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I didn’t hate the book, but it had some notable flaws that affected my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an engaging premise and a strong start, its misleading cover, uneven pacing, and lack of focus on compelling characters detracted from the overall experience. The delayed twist and rushed resolution left me wanting more action and depth in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, the execution fell flat, leaving me disappointed.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  - I struggled to stay engaged and was very close to not finishing the book (DNF). I ended up skipping parts and listening at double speed just to get through it.  \n  - The pacing was rough, and I found myself so bored that I stopped trying to guess or anticipate the twists, even when they came.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The book left me feeling disappointed and icky. I was eager to finish it just to be done with it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of the story had promise, the execution failed to deliver. The pacing and lack of engagement made it a difficult read, and the emotional payoff was unsatisfying. Overall, it was a disappointing experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

Not a whole lot was going on, and there was a lot of unnecessary back-and-forth between characters.  \n\n- **Setting and Nostalgia:**  \n  It's set in the 90s, but it didn't read that way. There weren't many hints at the nostalgia that is the 90s, so I'm not really sure why the author even bothered to mention it's set in that era.  \n\n- **Ending and Character Development:**  \n  Towards the end, it became pretty cheesy and lost me altogether. Characters were killed off just to kill off somebody and to get a reaction out of the reader. This didn't work on me since there were so many characters to begin with, and I didn't get the time to get invested in anyone.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I did enjoy the beginning and the dynamics/banter between the family members.  \n\n- **Interest in Sequel:**  \n  I'm not sure if I'll read the sequel (if there is one...but it seems like there will be).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong with an intriguing concept and engaging family dynamics, it lost momentum in the middle due to slow pacing and lack of plot development.

The women’s reactions to the events felt underwhelming—they seemed more like, “Oh, this is sad, but on with life.” Given the gravity of what happened, I expected a more devastating emotional response.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I didn’t feel attached to most of the characters, except for the oldest grandmother, Dulce, and the dog. The lack of connection made it harder to fully invest in the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  - The concept of the novel was fun and had potential, but it relied heavily on clichés, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting concept and a few standout elements (like Dulce and the dog), the predictable plot, lack of emotional depth, and reliance on clichés made it a somewhat underwhelming read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 STARS (rounded up to 3—primarily for the dog)."

            "The cover and initial impression suggested a horror/comedy novel about generations of women ensuring the dead remain undisturbed. However, the story takes a more serious turn, focusing on the Evans women's solemn responsibility for the deceased, with little comedic relief. This novel will likely resonate with fans of women's fiction and horror, particularly those who appreciate multi-generational family dynamics and a darker, more emotional narrative. The tone is steeped in tension and angst, with the action intensifying toward the end, appealing to readers who enjoy a slower build-up."

        "conclusion": "While the book didn't meet my initial expectations of a horror/comedy, it delivered a compelling story about four generations of women and their duty to keep the dead at rest. The tension and angst, along with the late-action payoff, make it a worthwhile read for fans of women's fiction and horror.",

The Evil Villain's actions contradict previously set rules, and these inconsistencies go unaddressed. For instance, Andy's sudden transformation into a master strigoi contradicts earlier claims about the time required for such a change, leaving readers perplexed. Additionally, the pacing is uneven; some chapters are engaging, while others are overly explanatory and dull. The author's tendency to recap and explain too much disrupts the story's flow and immersion.",

While the Evans women are perceived as odd by others, their lack of interaction with the town leaves their characterization feeling incomplete.",

It was anticlimactic when it happened, and the lead-up felt unnecessarily drawn out.  \n   - The mystery of WHO was behind everything was revealed too quickly. More time could’ve been spent on Luna’s role and how she fed on Andy, draining his life and turning him into a master strigoi (or a really strong strigoi).  \n   - Crane seemed like a planted ploy to create suspicion, but he didn’t have a real role beyond showing up creepily when needed.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and World-Building:**  \n   - The four generations of characters seemed important to the author, but their relevance to the story wasn’t entirely clear.  \n   - At first, it seemed odd that every character was somehow related or connected, but I realized it made sense for a small-town setting.  \n\n- **Descriptions and Gore:**  \n   - There was excessive description of physical sensations, like vomiting, throat experiences, and biting lips or the inside of mouths until blood is tasted. These details felt repetitive and unrealistic.  \n   - The frequent mentions of gore and blood made the story feel a bit boring despite the horror elements.  \n\n- **Editing and Errors:**  \n   - I noticed a few typos, such as mixing up Grace and Luna’s names or incorrectly referring to characters in exchanges.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was fairly entertaining, but the pacing felt uneven, with some parts overly drawn out and others rushed.

            "The story holds great potential, but the timeline feels disjointed. The history of the Evans family is unveiled too late, rendering it a predictable twist rather than a significant revelation. While their tendency to repeat past mistakes and create their own problems can be frustrating, it realistically reflects the challenges faced by young parents caught in a cycle.",

The 15-year cycle, a key plot element, only becomes clear halfway through the book. However, the pacing picks up significantly after the 60% mark, though some fight scenes become convoluted due to the various viewpoints. The ending feels rushed, leaving many questions unanswered and likely setting the stage for a sequel. While this lack of resolution may frustrate some readers, it also enhances the emotional impact, especially in the moments of family and female bonding. The story centers on the Evans women, whose lineage harbors a dark secret that each generation forgets until it’s too late. The arrival of a stranger in town triggers the unfolding events. Although the plot includes some YA elements—such as a bad boy love interest, magical undertones, and a coming-of-age subplot—it also delves into deeper themes of family history and identity.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book is gory and violent, reminiscent of *Santa Clarita Diet* but in novel form. It combines elements of murder, zombies, and high school drama, creating a unique and engaging tone.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The small-town setting is a highlight, with convoluted and overlapping relationships that add depth to the story. The inclusion of southern sayings adds a fun and creative layer to the atmosphere.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The premise revolves around the Evans women, whose lineage holds a dark secret that is forgotten by each generation until it’s too late. The arrival of a stranger in town sets the story in motion. While the plot has some YA-like elements (e.g., a bad boy love interest, magical undertones, and a coming-of-age subplot), it also explores deeper themes like family history and identity.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are well-intertwined due to the small-town setting, and their storylines are hinted at but not fully resolved. Some subplots, such as a character navigating their sexuality and the experiences of the seemingly sole Black girl in town, feel underdeveloped and unresolved.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The multi-POV storytelling can be confusing, especially with shifting perspectives and timelines. The 15-year cycle, a central element of the plot, doesn’t fully unfold until halfway through the book. The pacing improves significantly after the 60% mark, though some fight scenes become convoluted due to the multiple perspectives.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending feels rushed, with many questions left unanswered, likely setting up for a sequel. While the lack of a tidy resolution might frustrate some readers, it also leaves room for emotional impact, particularly in the family and women-bonding moments.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Twists:**  \n  The book delivers unexpected twists and evokes strong emotions, especially toward the end. The family dynamics and bonding moments are particularly touching.  \n\n- **Language and Vocabulary:**  \n  The book introduces new words like *cremones* and *petrichor*, adding an educational element to the reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is a mix of gory, violent fun and heartfelt family drama, set in a richly detailed small-town atmosphere. While the multi-POV structure and unresolved subplots can be confusing, the emotional depth and unexpected twists make it a memorable read. The rushed ending hints at a potential series, leaving readers eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story features a multitude of characters, but they lack distinctiveness, making their presence feel excessive. The four generations of women are too similar, suggesting that one or two could have been omitted without losing impact. The same applies to the various police officers. It seems the author aimed for a Stephen King-esque approach, populating a small-town setting with numerous characters. However, this effort falls short of the depth and vibrancy that King typically achieves.",

        "conclusion": "While I had high hopes for this book as a fan of vampire stories, it didn’t quite stand out as something special. The small-town Texas setting was enjoyable, but the time period (1999) didn’t add much to the story. The large cast of characters felt underdeveloped, and some seemed unnecessary. However, the supernatural and horror elements were well-executed, with eerie vibes and vivid descriptions. Despite its flaws, I liked the book enough to consider reading the next installment.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story is set in 1999 in Southwest Texas, where the Evans women, who run a Funeral Home, have the secret duty of keeping the undead dead. After 15 years without encountering a Strigoi, the death and subsequent reanimation of town gossip Mina Jean Murphy forces them back into action. The premise is intriguing and sets the stage for an engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The novel features four generations of the Evans women, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about each of them as the story unfolded. The family dynamics were particularly well-crafted and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  While the story was fun overall, it felt repetitive at times, which caused the pacing to drag a bit. This repetition slightly hindered my enjoyment, though it didn’t completely detract from the experience.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I listened to the audiobook version and thought the narrator did an amazing job bringing the characters to life. The multiple points of view (POVs) could occasionally be confusing, but the narration helped maintain clarity and engagement.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending left me intrigued and eager to see how the story progresses in the next installment. It set up a promising direction for the series, and I’m looking forward to continuing the journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read with a unique premise and well-developed characters. While the pacing had some repetitive moments, the strong family dynamics and excellent audiobook narration made up for it. The ending has me excited for the next book in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

While it may appeal to fans of both genres, the graphic horror elements made it less enjoyable for me personally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I’m disappointed that this isn’t a stand-alone novel. It frustrates me that every book seems to be part of a series these days, which I believe is a symptom of late-stage capitalism negatively impacting the publishing industry. This story had the potential for a beautiful, tender ending, but instead, we were left with a frustrating cliffhanger that felt cheap. If it weren’t for the ending, I would have rated it four stars, so keep that in mind. I did see the plot twist coming early on, but it didn’t diminish my overall enjoyment.",

It checked a lot of boxes for me: funny horror (but not scary), family dynamics, dogs, and good cop vs. bad cop dynamics. With all of this said, I enjoyed this book a lot.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Frustration:**  \n  I am really upset that it's not a stand-alone novel. I am so frustrated with Every. Single. Book. becoming a series. I believe late-stage capitalism is hurting the publishing industry. This could have had a really awesome, tender ending, and instead, we got a dumbass cliffhanger. The ending was incredibly cheapened. If it weren't for the ending, it would've gotten four stars, so use that information at your own discretion.  \n\n- **Characterization (Luna):**  \n  No lies, I hated Luna. I know I was her age once, and probably would've done the same dumb things she did, but she really ticked me off.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  I did spot the obvious plot twist right away, but that didn't detract anything for me.  \n\n- **Acknowledgements Warning:**  \n  Lastly, a word to the wise, DON'T read the acknowledgements until you are done. There is a huge spoiler in them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my frustration with the cliffhanger ending and the trend of turning books into series, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its humor, horror elements, and engaging themes like family dynamics and dogs. However, the ending and certain character choices (like Luna) held it back from being a four-star read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars  \nPG-13"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n   - I enjoyed the dark humor throughout the story, which added a fun, campy vibe to the horror.  \n\n- **Characterization and POVs:**  \n   - I appreciated getting glimpses into all the characters' thoughts, though I preferred some POVs more than others.  \n   - The three older women had a very similar vibe, making it hard to distinguish between the daughter, mom, and grandma.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n   - There was too much filler, and the story felt repetitive with frequent mentions of coffee/sandwich talk, sucking and clicking teeth, sucking air, butterscotch candy, tucking hair behind ears, etc.  \n   - My least favorite word, “belly,” was used by multiple characters, which was distracting.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n   - The pacing was slow, likely due to excessive descriptions and not enough action or plot progression.  \n   - A pet peeve of mine is when a significant event (e.g., “that good awful mess from 15 years ago”) is repeatedly referenced but not explained quickly enough. It took until the very end to get all the details, which felt too long for a predictable reveal.  \n\n- **Creature Depiction:**  \n   - The Strigoi felt more like mindless zombies than the vampires I expected, which was a bit disappointing.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The explanation at the end left me with many unanswered questions, which was frustrating.  \n   - Despite this, the story intrigued me enough that I’d consider reading the next book.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n   - There is some gore, but I wouldn’t call it scary—more like “horror lite.”  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - While the style and execution didn’t fully work for me, it was an entertaining and quick read with a great concept.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis campy horror novel had its strengths, including dark humor and an intriguing premise, but it was weighed down by repetitive writing, slow pacing, and underdeveloped elements. Despite its flaws, it was an entertaining read that left me curious about the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows the Evans family, a multigenerational group of women operating a funeral home in a small Texas town.

The plot intensifies when Luna, the youngest Evans, becomes pivotal to the unfolding events. While the pacing occasionally drags, it is offset by bursts of intense action and gore. The tone is dark and nostalgic, enriched by references to late '90s culture, such as pagers, which add a unique flair.",

Zombies? In a small town? Zombies that this family of women all knew about? Partners that suddenly disappear? Was Luna a zombie? I still don’t think I fully understand.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n   - Even though I didn’t fully get it, I had a fun time reading this one.  \n\n- **Timing and Release:**  \n   - I’m surprised it’s coming out in the spring since it definitely has that spooky Halloween vibe.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - Thanks NetGalley for the advanced read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some confusion about the plot and its elements, the novel was enjoyable to read, thanks to its engaging writing style, witty dialogue, and southern charm. The spooky atmosphere made it feel more suited for a Halloween release rather than spring.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Additionally, the line, “Darkness was like a disease once it got its teeth in you. A hungry thing that didn’t let go. Sometimes you had to feed it, keep it satiated, to stop it from spreading,” emphasizes the struggle against both internal and external darkness.",

The accents and excessive descriptions slowed the pacing, making the experience frustrating at times. The repetitive elements, like Ducey eating butterscotch, added an unintended layer of humor. Overall, I think this novel would have been more enjoyable in print.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

I found it hard to distinguish between them at times, which made it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was nice. It tied things up well and left me satisfied with how the story concluded.  \n\n- **Appeal to Genre Fans:**  \n  The novel is worth a look, especially if you enjoy 90s horror references. Fans of the genre will likely appreciate the nostalgic elements woven into the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some issues with pacing and character development, its strong concept, engaging setting, and satisfying ending make it a worthwhile read, particularly for fans of 90s horror.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The Evans women came across as caricatures or cruel stereotypes of Texas women from that time. The repeated mention of Lenore’s butterscotch candies became grating and added nothing to the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Perspective and Authenticity:**  \n  Knowing the writer’s background, it felt like the book carried a sense of contempt, as if the author was looking down on Southern culture. This lack of authenticity made the story fall flat for me.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  The book seemed heavily inspired by Grady Hendrix’s *The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires*, which is far superior. Hendrix, being from the South, handles the material with more nuance and authenticity. If given the choice, I’d recommend his novel over this one.  \n\n- **Graphic Content:**  \n  While some readers were shocked by the graphic material, I found it to be a distraction rather than an enhancement. It didn’t add depth to the story or characters.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I acknowledge that Lindy Ryan has some talent as a writer. However, this particular book didn’t showcase her strengths effectively.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Bless Your Heart* was a disappointment. The forced nostalgia, unrelatable characters, and lack of authenticity overshadowed the potential of the story. While the author shows promise, this book pales in comparison to similar works like Grady Hendrix’s novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review does not explicitly mention a numerical rating, but the tone suggests a low rating, likely around 2 stars, given the acknowledgment of the author’s talent despite the book’s flaws."

Despite spending a significant amount of time with each character, the repetitiveness of their descriptions and actions made them feel flat and uninteresting.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It took me longer than usual to finish the book because I struggled to stay engaged. I wasn’t particularly invested in seeing it through to the end, though I always give every book a chance to prove me wrong.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  I was able to predict the twist early on, so when it finally happened, it didn’t come as a surprise to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, its repetitive writing, flat characters, and predictable twist made it a less engaging read than I had hoped.

When townspeople start dying in gruesome ways and the bodies sent to their parlor begin rising from the dead, they discover the Strigoi, the original vampires, have returned. The Evan’s women must fight these vampires to protect their town. The premise was interesting and had potential.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book started off strong and engaging, but by the middle, it became slow and repetitive.

Some deaths seemed included solely to elicit a reaction from the reader, which made certain parts feel repetitive and pointless.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The family dynamic between the Evan’s women and their banter was enjoyable and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook was well-done and enhanced the experience. It was the primary reason I didn’t abandon the book.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  The book gave me Grady Hendrix vibes, so fans of his work might enjoy this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was intriguing and the family dynamics were a highlight, the pacing issues and repetitive elements detracted from the overall experience.

            "Crane's character reminded me of one of the goth kids from *South Park*. His real name is Robert, but he adopts the edgy pseudonym, Crane. I typically enjoy books that feature alternative characters, especially when they reference music that resonates with their subcultures. However, Crane's take on Type O Negative left me feeling psychologically unsettled. For instance, he describes Peter Steele as a \"giant among men,\" both figuratively and literally, noting that Steele is nearly seven feet tall and sings—if you can overlook the themes of death. This portrayal is misleading, as Type O Negative's catalog includes far more songs about sex than death, making Crane's comments feel out of touch.",
            "The horror scenes in this story are well-executed, with the author skillfully depicting corpses in a vivid and impactful manner. However, I was surprised that this book wasn't labeled as young adult, given that the main character, Luna, is 16, and the narrative primarily focuses on her and her friends, who are also around that age. Additionally, the book's heavy emphasis on a \"love yourself\" message felt overly preachy and cringeworthy at times."

Sure, they have a few, but most of their songs are about sex, so it didn’t even make much sense.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the horror elements were strong and vividly described, the book’s young adult themes and cringy moral messaging detracted from the experience.

Characters often make frustratingly poor decisions to advance the narrative, leading to a lack of coherence, especially towards the end. While the conclusion sets the stage for a sequel, it fails to fully realize the potential hinted at earlier in the story.",
            "The multiple points of view hindered character development, resulting in flat, two-dimensional portrayals. The author relied on repetitive habits, such as an older character's fondness for hard candy, to add depth, but this felt gimmicky. Despite featuring four women in the family, none stood out distinctly. Luna, the 15-year-old, occasionally felt like the main character, lending the book a young adult vibe.",
            "Luna's chapters were often painful to read, and her conversations with friends felt cringeworthy. Surprisingly, the deputy's perspective turned out to be the most enjoyable, especially since I initially expected to be more engaged with the family dynamics.",
            "Set in small-town Texas in 1999, the story follows the Evans family, who operate a funeral home dedicated to ensuring the dead remain undisturbed. The premise evokes a blend of Southern vampire mystery and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, creating an intriguing atmosphere."

The multiple POVs hindered character development, the plot was predictable, and the ending was disappointing. While the horror elements were well done, the book failed to explore relationships, character dynamics, or the small-town 90s setting effectively. It might be an okay pick for older teens interested in horror, but it didn’t hit the mark for me.",

The persistent miscommunication, lack of trust, and deep-seated resentment felt clichéd and unrealistic.

While generational trauma was likely intended to enhance character development, it ultimately came across as tedious and one-dimensional.",

This lack of depth makes it hard to care about the characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The narrative structure, which shifts between multiple perspectives, detracts from the mystery and cohesion of the story. While the intent may have been to show events the main characters didn’t witness, it ultimately feels disjointed and disrupts the flow.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book attempts to blend Southern charm with horror, but the execution falls short. The small-town charm is overshadowed by the lack of character engagement and the fragmented storytelling, making the atmosphere feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  While the concept is strong, the execution lacks polish. The book had potential but failed to deliver a cohesive and engaging experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Bless Your Heart* is a novel with a promising premise that combines Southern charm and horror, but it falls short in execution. The fragmented narrative and lack of character development make it difficult to connect with the story or its characters. While the idea is great, the book ultimately feels disjointed and underwhelming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The absence of any significant zombie-fighting scenes left the story feeling stagnant and unengaging.",

It took too long for anything significant to happen, which made the story feel dragged out.  \n\n- **Character Development and Roles:**  \n  The legacy of female strigoi killers was intriguing, but it was frustrating that only the great grandmother was allowed to do the killing. The grandmother and mother were consumed by grief and shame, which prevented them from communicating crucial information to Luna, even though their silence had deadly consequences in the past.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The friends were barely mentioned and added no substance to the story. Their inclusion felt tokenistic, as if they were only there to represent diversity (a gay guy and a black friend) without contributing meaningfully to the plot.  \n\n- **Cover Art and Symbolism:**  \n  The cover was misleading. None of the strigoi had fangs, and there was no fire depicted in the story, except for the cremation scene. This disconnect between the cover and the content was confusing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel suffered from slow pacing, lack of action, poor communication between characters, and the inclusion of underdeveloped supporting characters. The intriguing premise of a legacy of female strigoi killers was not fully realized, and the misleading cover added to the disappointment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This concept initially drew me in and reminded me of Grady Hendrix's *The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires*. However, while the idea sounded great, the execution didn't fully resonate with me.\n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I found the book difficult to get through and even had to put it down the first time I tried reading it. Despite returning to it months later, it remained a tough read. The pacing and overall engagement didn't hold my interest as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  The book reminded me of *The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires* by Grady Hendrix, which I also didn't enjoy. While the comparison is notable, it didn't enhance my appreciation for this novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Bless Your Heart* by Lindy Ryan has an appealing and unique premise, I struggled to connect with the story and found it challenging to finish. Despite my initial excitement, the execution and pacing didn't meet my expectations, and it fell short compared to similar works I've read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The multiple POVs and lack of character depth made it hard to connect with the story, and the pacing suffered from too much filler.

The plot dragged on, hindered by prolonged and obvious secrets that were revealed too late. The strigoi, intended to be terrifying monsters, lost their impact when they were easily defeated by elderly women in the final pages, undermining their threat. The ending felt rushed and unearned, with predictable revelations that lacked surprise. The announcement of a sequel was puzzling, as the first installment failed to provide a compelling narrative or generate meaningful anticipation for future works.",

Lenore’s deceased husband, Jimmy Stewart, is portrayed in an absurd and unrealistic manner. The only character with potential is Crane, but he is underutilized and barely makes an impact on the narrative.",
