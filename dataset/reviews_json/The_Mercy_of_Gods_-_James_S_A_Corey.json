            "The plot was rich with intriguing twists that kept me engaged and eager to return. The high stakes and horror-like elements, particularly the chilling scenario of humanity trapped in a deadly game, were especially compelling.",

            "The story's concept is captivating, set in a distant future on a planet where humans have lived for over 3,000 years. The civilization has lost touch with its origins and now faces a grave threat from the alien race known as the Carryx, who abduct the brightest humans to compete in a deadly contest against other alien species. This premise evokes comparisons to *Red Rising* and *The Hunger Games*, but with a darker, more scientific twist.",
            "The humans in the story felt surprisingly familiar, considering their civilization has thrived on another planet for 3,500 years. I anticipated more pronounced cultural differences from Earth in 2024. However, I recognize that the authors may have intended to make the humans relatable, especially in contrast to the intentionally unrelatable aliens."

Dafyd, the protagonist, was my favorite, but the others didn’t leave a strong impression.  \n\n- **Human Culture and Relatability:**  \n   - The humans felt almost too human, given that their civilization has existed on another planet for 3,500 years. I expected more significant cultural differences from Earth in 2024.  \n   - I understand the authors might have aimed to keep the humans relatable, especially since the aliens were intentionally unrelatable.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite minor nitpicks, the plot was so compelling that it didn’t significantly detract from my enjoyment of the story.  \n   - I would highly recommend adding this book to your to-be-read list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Mercy of Gods* by S.A.

While the characters and human culture could have been more distinct, the story’s high stakes and horror-like elements make it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5  \n\nThanks to Orbit for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Connection to the Expanse Universe:**\n   - Initially, I believed *Mercy of the Gods* was tied to the Expanse universe, though far removed from its familiar elements. However, I later discovered it’s not officially part of that universe, which made me question whether the similarities I noticed were intentional or coincidental. Regardless, the subtle tiebacks (real or imagined) were profound and intriguing, and I’m excited to see how future books might explore these connections further.\n\n- **Character Work:**\n   - The authors’ mastery of character work remains unparalleled. They delve into the granular details of what it means to be human, coping with an unsympathetic existence. This brilliance makes me feel deeply connected to the characters on a visceral level. Their ability to slow down events for the sake of connection leaves a lasting impression, reminiscent of Abraham’s fantasy works and even comparable to authors like Robin Hobb.\n\n- **Creativity and World-Building:**\n   - *Mercy of the Gods* is a wildly creative experience. The authors threw off constraints and had fun exploring new ideas, resulting in a story that is slow and gripping, fast and action-packed, and always exciting. The creature creation and exploration of alien biology were particularly satisfying, showcasing the authors’ ability to craft imaginative and immersive worlds.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**\n   - The story balances a slow, gripping build-up with fast-paced, action-packed sequences, creating a consistently engaging narrative. Every bit as good as the best of the Expanse series, it delivers a self-contained experience that stands on its own while hinting at broader connections.\n\n- **Recommendations and Audience:**\n   - Fans of James S.A. Corey and Daniel Abraham should dive in without hesitation, as the character work and creativity are superb. New readers should consider whether they plan to read the Expanse series first, as *Mercy of the Gods* contains implications that could spoil certain story arcs in the Expanse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Mercy of the Gods* is a highly satisfying and creatively rich novel that showcases the authors’ strengths in character work, world-building, and storytelling. While initially believed to be connected to the Expanse universe, it stands as a self-contained narrative that delivers an equally compelling experience.

When I saw James S.A. Corey had a new book coming out, I was thrilled and managed to get an ARC.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story follows a team of intellectual researchers and a few others, like Dafyd, on their home planet of Anjiin. They are suddenly attacked by huge, alien creatures, leading to the deaths of many friends and family members. The survivors are forced to make themselves useful to these aliens or face death. The central questions revolve around whether the researchers can survive and adapt to this new, terrifying reality.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are deeply developed, and we get to know them intimately throughout the book. Notable characters include Tonner, the feisty and slightly pompous head scientist, and Else, his assistant and girlfriend. While I initially struggled with the time spent delving into their thoughts, this investment paid off as the story progressed.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven for me. Around 40-50% of the way through, my interest waned, but it resurged afterward as the story took shape and became more gripping. The latter half of the book was difficult to put down.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - The book explores profound questions about survival, loss, and purpose. What does it mean to survive when everything you’ve ever known is gone? These themes added depth to the story and made it more thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Creativity:**  \n   - The worldbuilding is immersive and highly creative, with a smart plot and excellent action scenes. While it’s not The Expanse, it stands on its own as a unique and compelling story.  \n\n- **Emotional Connection and Anticipation:**  \n   - By the end, I felt deeply connected to this new crew and found myself rooting for them. They’re not like James Holden and his crew from The Expanse, but I’ve grown to care about them in their own right. I’m eagerly anticipating the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues early on, *The Mercy of Gods* is an immersive, thought-provoking, and creatively crafted novel. With its rich worldbuilding, well-developed characters, and gripping plot, it offers a fresh and compelling story that stands apart from The Expanse.

            "I found it difficult to connect with the characters in this story. Unlike other works where characters shine, these felt flat and forgettable.

            "The plot was action-packed, but it sacrificed worldbuilding for pacing. The story's narrow focus on a small group of characters, while effective in *Leviathan Wakes* for establishing a broader narrative, fell short here. As a result, the worldbuilding felt underdeveloped.",

As a fan of the Expanse series, I found the writing style to be one of the strongest aspects of the book.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I struggled to connect with the characters in this story. Compared to the Expanse series, where the characters were a standout feature, these characters felt flat and forgettable. The relationships, particularly the romance, were weaker and focused on crushes and kissing, which felt surprisingly juvenile for a book marketed to adults.\n\n- **Plot and Worldbuilding:**  \n  The plot was action-packed, but I felt it sacrificed worldbuilding for pacing. The story had a narrow scope, focusing on a small group of individuals. While this approach worked in *Leviathan Wakes* by laying the groundwork for a larger narrative, it didn’t have the same effect here. The worldbuilding felt underdeveloped in comparison.\n\n- **Expectations and Hype:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I still consider this a decent new release, especially when compared to other 2024 science fiction novels. However, it didn’t meet my expectations or live up to the level of hype I’ve seen online. I recommend approaching it with tempered expectations.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would still recommend readers try this book for themselves, but I advise going in with realistic expectations. It’s worth a read, but it may not resonate as strongly as the authors’ previous works.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel maintains the authors’ signature writing style, it falls short in character development and worldbuilding compared to their earlier works.

            "The human survival narrative felt limited and unengaging, particularly when juxtaposed with the more captivating alien elements. The emphasis on academic research and politics diminished the overall excitement and stakes of the story.",
            "The main characters, being academics, lack the dynamic appeal of protagonists found in *The Expanse*, such as a spaceship captain or a detective. They come across as one-dimensional and indistinguishable, lacking depth and emotional resonance. Their preoccupation with academic politics and research projects detracts from the human elements of the story, rendering them dull and unengaging.",
            "The writing is accessible and engaging, allowing for a quick read despite some lackluster plot elements. The pacing is generally strong, particularly in the alien-driven sections, which keep the story moving.",
            "The Carryx, the alien forces in the book, are a standout element. Mysterious and menacing, their motives and interactions create much of the story's tension and intrigue. Unlike their more background role in *The Expanse*, the Carryx are actively involved in this narrative, making their presence felt throughout. The exploration of their relationship with humans is the most captivating aspect of the story. This installment is not a sequel but a follow-up series set in a distant future where humanity inhabits a new planet, possibly in a different solar system or galaxy, with the inhabitants uncertain of how they arrived there. The plot centers on a group of biological researchers and their experiences during and after an alien invasion."

        "conclusion": "While the book has its strengths, particularly in its portrayal of the mysterious and compelling alien forces, it falls short in character development and the human-centric plotlines. The academic focus and lack of engaging human characters made parts of the story feel dull, despite the fast-paced writing and intriguing alien elements. The next books will need to expand the scope and improve character engagement to maintain my interest.",

            "Set in a distant future on the planet Anjiin, the story explores humanity's struggle against the alien species known as the Carryx. A group of brilliant scientists is transported to the Carryx homeworld, where they must navigate a deadly competition for survival. The narrative weaves together mystery, intrigue, horror, and raw human emotion, crafting a gripping survival first-contact tale that is both terrifying and captivating. While not fast-paced or action-driven, the story remains highly engaging and difficult to put down.",
            "The diverse cast of scientists is remarkably well-developed, each character vividly embodying relatable human flaws. The story intimately explores the impact of extreme stress, trauma, and horror on individuals, emphasizing themes of morality and mental health. The inner conflicts and interpersonal drama are compelling, revealing how people rationalize their actions in the name of survival.",
            "This story is lauded for its vivid imagination and scientific depth, though some readers might struggle with the technical details. Its immersive and alien atmosphere is complemented by a slow-burn, character-driven narrative that skillfully balances epic and intimate moments. The incorporation of non-human perspectives and the subtle foreshadowing of the ending enhance the intrigue, ensuring that readers remain captivated throughout.",
            "This story explores profound themes of morality, mental health, and the limits of human endurance. The depiction of the Carryx and the cultural clashes between species is both terrifying and captivating, drawing in readers with an interest in anthropology and linguistics. The inclusion of non-human perspectives, such as the Carryx excerpts and the elusive ‘swarm’ point of view, adds depth and a sense of dread to the narrative.",
            "I found myself intellectually captivated rather than emotionally invested, appreciating the story's depth and complexity, even when certain elements were challenging to fully understand. Although some scientific aspects felt alienating, I remained engaged and excited throughout. The ending is both tragically fitting and ominously foreboding, leaving me eager for more and reigniting my interest in the author's other works."

The story’s intrigue and mystery, along with its tragic and foreboding ending, make it a highly recommended read for fans of the genre.",

            "The initial confusion surrounding the swarm/spy element is resolved once its purpose is revealed. The actions of the Night Drinkers are both shocking and unexpected. Set on Anjiin, the story explores the coexistence of humans with local flora and fauna, as scientists work to bridge these biological systems. The discovery of alien ships shifts the narrative toward themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization in the face of a superior, incomprehensible species. The book delves into how humans create and sustain civilization, particularly when confronted with forces they cannot overpower or fully comprehend.",
            "This story's focus on scientists as protagonists is refreshing, and their struggles kept me engaged and theorizing for days. The characters are well-developed, highlighting themes of found family, human interaction, and mental health. Jessyn's portrayal of depression and the collective trauma experienced by the characters is particularly compelling. Touching moments, such as Daffyd snapping at Campar yet admitting he never wants the jokes to stop, add depth to their relationships.",
            "The character development is outstanding, particularly in the dialogue between Campar and Jessyn: “It’ll be all right.” / “It won’t.” / “No. But we’ll find a way to be all right with that.” This exchange beautifully encapsulates the story's essence. The academic humor, such as “you need funding, I need funding, we all need funding,” adds a delightful touch of levity. While the alien biology and concepts like the Carryx can be confusing, this ambiguity feels intentional and ultimately works for the narrative.",
            "This sci-fi book initially attracted me, but it differs significantly from *The Expanse*. It aligns more with Daniel Abraham’s solo work, remaining firmly in the sci-fi realm rather than venturing into fantasy. While the narrative is dense and took me a while to get through, it’s not unenjoyable—just a bit challenging."

        "conclusion": "This book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenges of maintaining civilization. While it’s very different from *The Expanse*, it excels in character development, particularly in its portrayal of mental health, trauma, and found family. The writing is sharp, with moments of humor and profound insight, though some elements of the alien biology and plot were intentionally perplexing. Overall, it’s a rewarding read that left me reflecting on its themes and characters long after finishing.",

Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. While I liked it, it didn’t grab me as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is intelligent, and I appreciated the overarching theme of relying on outside factors, which was present in various scenarios. However, the plot shifted from the initial excitement of the alien attack to focusing on captivity and adjusting to a new lifestyle. This transition didn’t hold my interest as much, especially the parts about the experiments the scientists were forced to conduct for their captors, which I found boring.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Each character symbolized a different way of handling captivity, which was an interesting concept. However, I didn’t connect deeply with any of them, and none stood out as particularly memorable. This might have been intentional, but it left me feeling detached.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The beginning was gripping, especially during the alien attack, but the momentum didn’t last.

Martin in New Mexico. They are polished professionals who work well together, and I find Ty Franck's ritual disclaimer about revealing his location amusing. According to their joint website, both still live in Albuquerque, which is nice but wasn’t my preferred location when I lived in New Mexico.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Style:**  \n  The writing is described as \"good stuff, smooth as the finest whiskey.\" The novel is praised for being \"perfectly paced and smoothly written,\" with a narrative that digs into the core of who people are when stripped of everything by trauma and pressure.\n\n- **Endorsements and Praise:**  \n  The book features back-cover blurbs from notable authors like John Scalzi, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ryka Aoki, Django Wexler, and Bethany Jacobs, all urging readers not to miss it. I agree with their sentiments wholeheartedly.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I was so captivated that I started reading the day after picking up the library copy, knowing it wouldn’t renew. Upon finishing, my thoughts were simply, \"Wow.\" I give out very few full 5-star ratings, and this book earned one. If you enjoyed *The Expanse* series, this is even better. It’s a classic book that should not be missed.\n\n- **Reviewer’s Additional Thoughts:**  \n  I plan to revisit the late part of the book to find quotes to add to my review. The best review I’ve seen so far is by Amal el-Mohtar in *The New York Times*, which perfectly captures the essence of the book. I’m happy to share a copy with non-subscribers, but honestly, this book speaks for itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a masterpiece of science fiction, combining exceptional writing, deep character exploration, and a compelling narrative.

            "The plot unfolds too slowly, with much of the action occurring in the characters' minds rather than through their actions or interactions. The ending feels both drawn out and rushed, failing to provide a satisfying conclusion or meaningful conflict. The initial conflict is uninspired and lacks connection to a larger narrative, rendering it a waste of time. Although the ending aims to provoke reactions, it ultimately feels both delayed and hurried. While it hints at potential for future stories, this installment does not offer enough to spark my interest in continuing. The narration style, which filters excitement through layers of introspection, leaves me hesitant to explore more from this author.",
            "The characters felt one-dimensional, and the shifting points of view lacked distinct voices. The romance relied heavily on a female character who had little personality beyond her appeal to men. The climactic decision in the final chapters went unexamined and unchallenged, turning what could have been a compelling conflict into a flat and unengaging moment.",
            "The introspection in the story felt excessive, resembling an overly long character study or a YA novel. The narration repeatedly emphasized every point and emotion, resulting in a tiring reading experience that could have benefited from more editing. Additionally, the shifting points of view were repetitive and failed to provide fresh insights, rendering the characters' perspectives uniform and uninspired.",
            "The worldbuilding felt insufficient, relying heavily on info-dumping instead of organic storytelling. The aliens, intended to be mysterious, appeared underdeveloped and predictable, leading to confusion and disappointment. Additionally, the repetitive codas foreshadowing the doom of the Carryx became tiresome, especially when juxtaposed with the uneventful main narrative.",
            "I attempted to shift my expectations from a traditional space opera to an experimental narrative exploring alien invasion, trauma, and human connections. Unfortunately, the book still fell short of these adjusted expectations. Both the marketing and the content made certain promises that ultimately went unfulfilled, leaving me feeling disappointed and frustrated."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Mercy of Gods* was a disappointing read that failed to meet the expectations set by its marketing and early promises. The plot was slow and uneventful, the characters were bland, and the worldbuilding was underwhelming. The excessive introspection and repetitive POVs made the book a tiring read, and the ending, while setting up future potential, did not deliver enough to make me excited for the next installment. I am hesitant to continue, given the book's inability to keep its promises and its lack of meaningful conflict or development.",

The plot centers on a sudden alien invasion by the Carryx, who swiftly overpower humanity and capture its scientists. This narrative uniquely focuses on the scientists' experiences as they are relocated and re-educated by their captors. The introduction of a hidden alien species adds layers of mystery, prompting questions about the Carryx's motives, their dominance, and their reasons for targeting the brightest minds. Interludes featuring a librarian hint at a future interstellar court, suggesting a broader, evolving universe.",

The only downside is that I don’t have the next book to dive into immediately.  \n\n- **Scale and Boldness:**  \n  This is go-big-or-go-home sci-fi, and I love how the series ratcheted up the drama to an epic scale with the highest stakes possible. Few authors, like Cixin Liu, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Christopher Ruocchio, and James S.A. Corey, have achieved this for me, but none have gone so big so soon as *The Mercy of Gods* did. It earns an A+ for boldness.  \n\n- **Non-Human POVs:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of sci-fi is reading from non-human perspectives, and this book executed that to perfection. It was a standout highlight for me.  \n\n- **Human Ensemble Cast:**  \n  The human characters were subtle and nuanced, which I appreciated. While they might not be as colorful or strong as the cast in *The Expanse*, I found them riveting in their quieter, idiosyncratic ways.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

The transitions between viewpoints are skillfully managed, making effective use of the 400+ page length.",
            "In this story, the human characters of a research team transition from navigating academic dynamics to grappling with moral and ethical dilemmas within the Carryx prison camp. Dafyd, the central protagonist, is a schemer with a broad mindset, quickly adapting to the alien environment. Jessyn, a skilled researcher living with bipolar disorder, faces significant challenges to her mental health under extreme conditions. Tonner, the brilliant team leader, is slow to recognize the dangers they face, while Rickar, an outsider, offers a more grounded perspective. The characters' mental health conditions and psychiatric disabilities enhance their relatability and resilience in these extraordinary circumstances.",
            "The prose was polished and error-free, reflecting the authors' high standards. The descriptive writing was strong, and the action sequences matched the quality of their previous work. The dialogue, especially the concise short sentences, was both enjoyable and effective.",
            "The world-building was impressive, seamlessly integrating hard science fiction with advanced alien technologies. The depiction of the Carryx's brutality and the harsh conditions of the prison camp effectively echoed historical human atrocities. Additionally, the inclusion of various alien species enriched the setting, adding further depth to the narrative.",

The presence of The Swarm, a nanotech spy, adds an intriguing layer, even if its identity is somewhat predictable. Elements of sex, drugs, and violence are incorporated thoughtfully and contextually.",
            "I picked up this book anticipating a read akin to *The Expanse*, but it offered a refreshing divergence. The writing team’s high production values and seamless collaboration resulted in polished prose. While it began with a literary science fiction tone, it gradually shifted to a more familiar style as the story unfolded."

            "The book is thrilling and engaging, particularly with the suspense surrounding Dafyd's potential to become a major threat to the aliens. However, the section where the characters work on the puzzle drags a bit, mainly due to the uncertainty of the outcome.",
            "This book piqued my interest in the characters, especially my desire for the Swarm to find happiness. Typically, it takes me more than one book to fully connect with characters, a sentiment I've experienced with the author's previous works as well. I believe that with another installment and a re-read, my bond with the characters will deepen.",
            "The setting of Anjiin is captivating, featuring humans who have lived on the planet for 3,000 years, oblivious to their origins. The alien species is genuinely otherworldly, creating a significant conflict as humans must shift their perspective to comprehend them. Dafyd emerges as a standout character, exceptionally adept at navigating this alien mindset.",
            "The book thoughtfully examines the psychological impact of trauma, portraying a diverse array of human reactions with empathy and nuance. Although the exploration of trauma can be unsettling, it enriches the narrative and adds significant depth to the story.",
            "The book serves as a promising setup for future events, with Dafyd emerging as a significant thorn in the aliens' side. While the wait for the next installment feels lengthy, the story holds strong potential, especially considering the authors' impressive track record."

While it’s not officially part of the Expanse universe, it shares a similar tone and depth, making it a must-read for fans of the genre. The story is self-contained, engaging, and leaves me eagerly anticipating the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4.5/5 stars."

Initially, the pacing felt slow, and I nearly gave up around the 40-50% mark. However, my interest reignited, and the narrative became gripping and hard to put down.

Unfortunately, the characters come across as one-dimensional and indistinguishable, making it challenging to form a connection with them. As a result, their fates evoke little concern. The emphasis on academic politics and research projects in the first 100 pages further detracts from the narrative, hindering investment in the story. Overall, the human characters tend to weigh down the book, with only a few exceptions standing out.",

            "The story centers on humans living on Anjiin, coexisting with the local flora and fauna. Scientists like Tonner Freis and Llaren Morse work to bridge the gap between human and alien biology. However, the arrival of alien ships shifts the narrative toward themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenge of preserving civilization in the face of a superior, incomprehensible species. The book delves into how humans create and sustain their civilization, particularly when confronted with forces they cannot overpower or fully comprehend.",
            "This story's focus on scientists as protagonists is refreshing, and their struggles kept me engaged and theorizing for days. The characters truly shine, emphasizing themes of found family, human connection, and mental health. Jessyn's portrayal of depression and the collective trauma experienced by the characters is particularly compelling. Moments like Daffyd snapping at Campar yet acknowledging the value of their bond are deeply touching and demonstrate excellent character development.",
            "This book is dense and thought-provoking, reflecting the characters' confusion and discoveries throughout the narrative. The dialogue, particularly the academic humor (e.g., “You need funding, I need funding, we all need funding”), adds a relatable touch. The final exchange between Campar and Jessyn beautifully encapsulates the book's themes: “It’ll be all right.” / “It won’t.” / “No. But we’ll find a way to be all right with that.”",
            "The alien biology and concepts, such as the swarm/spy/thing and the Carryx, were both confusing and intriguing. I accepted that it was fine not to fully grasp them. The Night Drinkers, on the other hand, were shocking, and their unexpected role in the story left a significant impact.",
            "This sci-fi book initially captivated me, but it diverges significantly from *The Expanse*. It aligns more closely with Daniel Abraham’s solo work, firmly rooted in the sci-fi genre rather than fantasy. While I found it dense and challenging at first, it ultimately proved to be a rewarding read."

        "conclusion": "This book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization in the face of the unknown. While it differs from *The Expanse*, it excels in character development, particularly in its portrayal of mental health, trauma, and found family. The alien concepts and world-building are complex and sometimes confusing, but they add depth to the story. Overall, it’s a challenging yet rewarding read with memorable characters and moments.",

It leans more toward Daniel Abraham’s solo work, though it remains firmly in the sci-fi realm rather than fantasy.\n   - I struggled at first because it’s a dense book, but it’s not bad—just challenging.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The story revolves around humans on Anjiin coexisting with local flora and fauna, with scientists like Tonner Freis and Llaren Morse trying to bridge the gap between human and alien biology.\n   - The arrival of alien ships shifts the narrative to themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization when faced with a superior, incomprehensible species.\n   - The book explores how humans create and sustain civilization, especially when confronted with something they can’t overpower or fully understand.\n\n- **Characters and Development:**\n   - The focus on scientists as protagonists was refreshing, and their struggles kept me engaged and theorizing for days.\n   - The characters are the highlight of the book, with a strong emphasis on found family, human interaction, and mental health.\n   - Jessyn’s portrayal of depression and the collective trauma experienced by the characters were particularly compelling.\n   - Moments like Daffyd snapping at Campar but admitting he still values their bond were deeply touching and showcased excellent character work.\n\n- **Writing and Style:**\n   - The book is dense and thought-provoking, with a narrative that mirrors the characters’ confusion and discovery.\n   - The dialogue, especially the academia jokes (e.g., “you need funding, I need funding, we all need funding”), added humor and relatability.\n   - The ending interaction between Campar and Jessyn was beautifully written and encapsulated the book’s themes: “It’ll be all right.” / “It won’t.” / “No. But we’ll find a way to be all right with that.”\n\n- **World-Building and Alien Concepts:**\n   - The alien biology and concepts like the swarm/spy/thing and the Carryx were confusing but intriguing. I decided it’s okay not to fully understand them.\n   - The Night Drinkers were shocking, and their role in the story was unexpected and impactful.\n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**\n   - “If there was a war coming, it would find them gardening.”\n   - “We should field-test it,” Jessyn said. “Invite one of our little friends over for dinner and some light vivisection?”\n   - “They had made two weapons from what they had. She was one of them.”\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization in the face of the unknown. While it differs from *The Expanse*, it excels in character development, particularly in its portrayal of mental health, trauma, and found family. The alien concepts and world-building are complex and sometimes confusing, but they add depth to the story. Overall, it’s a challenging yet rewarding read with memorable characters and moments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Each character represented a unique approach to captivity, which was intriguing. However, I didn't connect with any of them, possibly by design, as none were meant to stand out. This choice ultimately left me feeling disengaged.",
            "The novel is thought-provoking, with a compelling theme centered on dependence on external factors woven throughout various scenarios. The opening, particularly the alien attack, captivated me; however, the narrative soon shifted to the scientists' captivity and their adaptation to a new lifestyle. This segment, especially the forced experiments, felt tedious. While I recognize the authors intended it as a symbolic element, it ultimately failed to engage me.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I loved *The Expanse* series and was really looking forward to this new book. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. While I liked it, it didn’t grab me as I had hoped. I believe I was expecting something a little different.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is intelligent, and I appreciated the overarching theme of relying on outside factors, which was present throughout in different scenarios. The beginning grabbed me, especially during the alien attack, but the focus shifted to the scientists' captivity and their adjustment to a new lifestyle. This part of the story, particularly the experiments they were forced to conduct, bored me. It felt like the authors were using this as a symbolic element, but it didn’t excite me.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Each character symbolized a different way of handling captivity, which was interesting. However, I didn’t fall in love with any of them. This might have been intentional, as no one was meant to stand out, but it left me feeling disconnected.\n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  This opening book didn’t start with a bang, but it did pique my interest. I’m curious about what will happen next. It feels like the first episode of a new TV series—not bad, but I’ll give it a few more episodes (or books) to see if it grabs me. I liked it enough to continue with the series and hope the next installments will be more engaging.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel didn’t fully meet my expectations, it has potential as the start of a new series. The themes and ideas are intriguing, but the execution didn’t captivate me as much as I had hoped. I’m willing to give the next books a chance to see if they can deliver a more compelling experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Authors' Reputation and Collaboration:**  \n  The two authors are among the top 1% in earnings among the world's SF writers, second only to George R.R. Martin in New Mexico. They are polished professionals who work well together. I find Ty Franck's ritual disclaimer about revealing his location amusing. According to their joint website, both still live in Albuquerque, which is nice but wasn’t my preferred location when I lived in New Mexico.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Style:**  \n  The writing is smooth and polished, comparable to the finest whiskey. The pacing is perfect, and the prose is seamlessly crafted. The book digs into the core of who people are when stripped of everything by trauma and pressure.\n\n- **Endorsements and Praise:**  \n  The back-cover blurbs feature glowing recommendations from notable authors like John Scalzi, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ryka Aoki, Django Wexler, and Bethany Jacobs, all urging readers not to miss this book. I wholeheartedly agree with their sentiments.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I was thoroughly impressed by the novel, giving it a rare full 5-star rating. If you enjoyed *The Expanse* series, this book is even better. It’s a classic that should not be missed. I’ll be revisiting parts of the book to find quotes to share and add more thoughts later.\n\n- **External Review Reference:**  \n  The best review I’ve seen is by Amal el-Mohtar in *The New York Times*, which perfectly captures the essence of the book: “Perfectly paced and smoothly written, this is a book that digs into who people are at their core, when trauma and pressure strip everything else away.”\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is an exceptional science fiction novel that surpasses even *The Expanse* in quality. With its polished writing, deep exploration of human nature, and glowing endorsements from top authors, it’s a must-read. I highly recommend it and will be revisiting it for further insights.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 out of 5 stars."

Although the ending aims to provoke reactions, it falls short, failing to deliver genuine conflict or fully leverage earlier events, leaving the fallout limited and disappointing.",

It’s rare for me to feel this way about a first book in a series. The only downside is that I don’t have the next book to dive into immediately.  \n\n- **Scale and Boldness:**  \n  This is go-big-or-go-home sci-fi, and I love how the series ratcheted up the drama to an epic scale with the highest stakes possible right from the start. Few authors, like Cixin Liu, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Christopher Ruocchio, and James S.A. Corey, have achieved this level of boldness, but none have gone so big so soon as *The Mercy of Gods* did. A+ for boldness.  \n\n- **Non-Human POVs:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of sci-fi is reading from non-human perspectives, and this book executed that to perfection. It was a standout highlight for me, used intermittently but effectively.  \n\n- **Human Ensemble Cast:**  \n  The human characters were well-crafted, with subtle and idiosyncratic archetypes that stood out in their own quieter ways. While some readers might find them less compelling compared to the more colorful and strong personalities in *The Expanse*, I found them riveting and refreshing.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and the various settings were immersive and captivating. I was utterly gripped throughout the book and can’t wait for more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an exceptional start to a sci-fi series, with bold storytelling, engaging non-human POVs, a well-developed human ensemble cast, and a gripping plot.

            "The story initially centers on the dynamics of the human research team but quickly transitions to the moral and ethical dilemmas surrounding their imprisonment. Espionage plays a significant role, particularly with *The Swarm*, a nanotech spy whose identity is somewhat predictable. While the pacing is generally effective, some readers may be disappointed by the absence of space battles.",
            "The human characters in the research team were well-developed, with their inner dialogues and motivations evolving in response to their imprisonment. Each main character faced mental health challenges, making them relatable and resilient in extreme conditions. Dafyd, the nominal protagonist, was a schemer with an open mind, while Jessyn grappled with bipolar disorder. Tonner, the team leader, displayed traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Rickar provided a more conventional perspective as the outsider.",
            "The prose was expertly crafted and free of errors, reflecting the high production values typical of this writing team. The narrative transitioned from a literary tone in the early chapters to a more straightforward, action-driven style as the story unfolded. The descriptive writing was strong, and the action sequences matched the quality of the authors' previous works. Dialogue stood out, particularly the sharp, concise sentences. The use of six third-person limited perspectives was skillfully managed, fitting seamlessly into the 400+ page length. The shifting viewpoints were compact and effective, emphasizing action and dialogue.",
            "The world-building was impressive, seamlessly merging hard science fiction with advanced, almost magical technologies. The brutality of the Carryx and the harsh conditions of the prison camp were vividly portrayed, evoking parallels to historical human atrocities. Additionally, the inclusion of alien species and their interactions with humans enriched the narrative, adding depth to the setting.",
            "The story explores themes of survival, adaptation, and the moral complexities of captivity. It features tasteful depictions of both heterosexual and homosexual relationships, as well as drug use and violence, all presented in a contextually appropriate manner. The narrative includes a high body count, with instances of genocidal violence and moderately graphic portrayals of physical conflict.",
            "I approached the book expecting it to resemble other works in the genre, but I was pleasantly surprised by its freshness and distinctiveness. The writing style initially evoked literary science fiction, reminiscent of some acclaimed titles, before transitioning to a more familiar tone. I hope the series doesn’t extend excessively over many years, as some do."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book exceeded my expectations, offering a fresh and well-written start. The characters, particularly those with mental health conditions, were compelling and well-developed. The world-building was immersive, though some inconsistencies stood out. The story was engaging, but I remain cautious about the potential length and pacing of the narrative. Overall, it’s a strong entry into semi-hard science fiction, with a gritty and thought-provoking narrative.",

A. Corey* style.  \n   - I hope this series doesn’t stretch to nine books over 11 years, as *The Expanse* did.  \n\n- **Prose and Writing Quality**  \n   - The prose was well-crafted and error-free, maintaining the high production values typical of the *James S.

Tonner, the team leader, exhibited traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Rickar was the outsider with a more “normal” perspective.  \n\n- **World-Building and Science Fiction Elements**  \n   - The world-building was strong, blending hard science fiction with advanced, almost magical technologies.  \n   - The Carryx’s brutality and the prison camp conditions were vividly depicted, drawing parallels to historical human atrocities.  \n   - The inclusion of alien species and their interactions with humans added depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story began with a focus on the human research team’s dynamics but shifted to the moral and ethical dilemmas of their imprisonment.  \n   - The plot included espionage, with *The Swarm* (a nanotech spy) playing a key role, though its identity was not well-hidden.  \n   - The pacing was generally good, though some readers might find the lack of space battles disappointing.  \n\n- **Themes and Content**  \n   - Themes of survival, adaptation, and the moral complexities of captivity were central.  \n   - The story included tasteful depictions of sex (both heterosexual and homosexual), drug use, and violence, all of which were contextually appropriate.  \n   - The body count was high, with genocidal violence and moderately graphic depictions of physical conflict.  \n\n- **Criticisms and Quibbles**  \n   - Some aspects of world-building felt inconsistent, such as the human prisoners’ ability to use alien lab equipment without issue.  \n   - The lack of attempts to create intoxicants for stress relief seemed unrealistic, given the resources available.  \n   - The presence of only one *Swarm* felt odd, given the scale of the Carryx’s destruction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations, offering a fresh and well-written start to a new series.

            "The book is thrilling and engaging, particularly with the suspense surrounding Dafyd's potential as a significant threat to the aliens. However, the section where the characters attempt to solve the puzzle drags a bit due to the uncertainty of the outcome.",
            "The book piqued my interest in the characters, especially my desire for the Swarm to find happiness. Typically, it takes more than one book for me to fully connect with characters, a sentiment I also felt with the author's previous works.",
            "Set on the mysterious planet Anjiin, where humans have lived for 3,000 years without knowledge of their origins, the story explores the profound conflict that arises when humans must transcend their own perspectives to comprehend the truly alien inhabitants. Dafyd stands out as a remarkable character, excelling in his ability to understand and adapt to the alien mindset.",
            "This book offers a profound exploration of the psychological effects of trauma, portraying a spectrum of reactions with empathy and nuance. Although the focus on trauma can be unsettling, its depth and realism are commendable.",
            "This book serves as a promising setup for future installments, hinting at Dafyd's potential to become a significant challenge for the aliens. I look forward to deepening my connection with the characters in the next installment and plan to re-read this one through the audiobook narrated by Jefferson Mays."

It might be my favorite sci-fi novel.  \n   - I haven’t read *The Expanse* series, so I can’t compare this book to it, and I worry about potentially misleading fans of that series if they are significantly different.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a tremendous read, combining masterful storytelling, emotional depth, and immersive world-building. It explores profound themes of trauma, resilience, and human nature, all while delivering a gripping sci-fi narrative. While I can’t compare it to *The Expanse*, this standalone experience left me deeply impressed and emotionally moved.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story follows a new human society grappling with a grave threat from the alien race known as the Carryx, who abduct the brightest humans and compel them to compete in a deadly contest against other alien species. This premise evokes comparisons to *Red Rising* and *The Hunger Games*, yet it carries a darker, more scientific undertone.",
            "The portrayal of humans felt almost too familiar, which was a slight disappointment. After 3,500 years on another planet, I anticipated more pronounced cultural differences from Earth in 2024. While I understand the authors' intention to keep the humans relatable, especially in contrast to the intentionally unrelatable aliens, I wished for a deeper exploration of their unique culture."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Connection to the Expanse Universe:**\n   - Initially, I believed *Mercy of the Gods* was tied to the Expanse universe, though far removed from its familiar elements. However, I later discovered it’s not officially part of that universe, which made me question whether the similarities I noticed were intentional or coincidental. Regardless, the subtle tiebacks (real or imagined) were profound and intriguing, and I’m excited to see how future books might explore these connections further.\n\n- **Character Work:**\n   - The authors’ mastery of character work remains unparalleled. They delve into the granular details of what it means to be human, coping with an unsympathetic existence. This brilliance makes me feel deeply connected to the characters on a visceral level. Their ability to slow down events for the sake of connection leaves a lasting impression, reminiscent of Abraham’s fantasy works and even authors like Robin Hobb.\n\n- **Creativity and World-Building:**\n   - *Mercy of the Gods* is a wildly creative experience. The authors threw off constraints and had fun exploring new ideas, resulting in a story that’s slow and gripping, fast and action-packed, and always exciting. The creature creation and exploration of alien biology were particularly satisfying, showcasing the authors’ ability to craft imaginative and immersive worlds.\n\n- **Standalone Nature and Recommendations:**\n   - The book is a 100% self-contained narrative, so it can be enjoyed without having read *The Expanse*. However, if you plan to read *The Expanse* in the future, starting there might be advisable to avoid spoilers for its story arcs. That said, *Mercy of the Gods* stands strong on its own and is a must-read for fans of James S.A. Corey and Daniel Abraham, especially for its superb character work and creativity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Mercy of the Gods* is a brilliant addition to the authors’ body of work, showcasing their mastery of character development, creativity, and world-building.

When I saw James S.A. Corey had a new book coming out, I was thrilled and managed to get an ARC.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story follows a team of intellectual researchers and a few others, like Dafyd, on their home planet of Anjiin. They are suddenly attacked by huge, alien creatures, leading to the deaths of many, including friends and family. The survivors are forced to make themselves useful to these alien beings or face death. The central questions revolve around survival, purpose, and the larger implications for humanity.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are well-developed, and we get to know them intimately throughout the book. Notable characters include Tonner, the feisty and slightly pompous head scientist, and Else, his assistant and girlfriend. Dafyd and others also stand out as the story progresses.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing was initially slow, and I considered quitting around the 40-50% mark. However, my interest resurged after that point, and the story became compelling and hard to put down.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - The book explores profound themes, such as the meaning of survival when everything you’ve ever known is gone. It raises larger questions about humanity and what grounds us in life.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Creativity:**  \n   - The worldbuilding is immersive and seriously creative, with a smart plot and excellent action scenes.  \n\n- **Comparison to The Expanse:**  \n   - This book is not The Expanse, and I don’t want it to be. It stands on its own with a new crew to root for. While they’re not like James Holden and his crew, I’m beginning to feel for them in their own right.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - Highly recommended! I can’t wait for the next book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Mercy of Gods is a gripping and immersive novel with strong character development, creative worldbuilding, and thought-provoking themes. Despite some pacing issues early on, the story becomes deeply engaging and leaves me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a high rating, likely 4.5/5 or 5/5."

            "The main characters, being academics, lack the engaging qualities of the space captain and detective in *The Expanse*. Much of the first 100 pages is consumed by discussions of academic politics and research, which slows the narrative and feels tedious. The characters come across as one-dimensional and indistinguishable, making it challenging to connect with them or care about their outcomes. While there are a few standout human-focused scenes, most feel laborious.",

These aliens are both terrifying and intriguing, with each revelation about their motives and nature drawing the reader in. The alien elements serve as the primary driving force of the narrative, keeping me thoroughly engaged. This is not a sequel but a follow-up series set in a distant future where humanity inhabits a new planet, possibly in a different solar system or galaxy, and the inhabitants are uncertain of how they arrived there. The plot follows a group of biological researchers as they navigate their experiences during and after an alien invasion."

        "conclusion": "This book has a compelling alien-focused narrative and fast-paced writing, but it struggles with unengaging human characters and a narrow scope. While I was entertained and intrigued by the alien elements, the lack of connection to the human storylines prevented me from fully enjoying the book. My continued interest will depend on whether the next installments broaden the world and improve character engagement.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n   - This is not a sequel to *The Expanse* but a follow-up series set in a far future where humanity is on a different planet, possibly in a different solar system or galaxy. The humans on the planet are unsure how they got there.  \n   - The story follows a group of academic researchers in biology, focusing on their experiences during and after an alien invasion.  \n\n- **Characters and Characterization:**  \n   - The main characters are academics, which makes them inherently less engaging compared to the space captain and detective in *The Expanse*.  \n   - The characters spend much of the first 100 pages discussing academic politics and research, which feels uninteresting and drags the story.  \n   - The characters feel cardboard-like and hard to distinguish from one another, making it difficult to form a connection or care about their fates.  \n   - Human-focused scenes often feel like a drag, with only a few exceptions.  \n\n- **Alien Elements and World-Building:**  \n   - The alien forces, the Carryx, are front and center, with dialogue and direct interaction, unlike the background presence in *The Expanse*.  \n   - The aliens are scary, mysterious, and wholly interesting, with every reveal about their motives and nature being compelling.  \n   - The alien elements are the primary driving force of the story and what kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is digestible and not overly dense, making the pages turn quickly despite some uninteresting plot elements.  \n   - The pacing is fast, and the story is mostly entertaining, though the human survival aspects feel dull in comparison to the alien-focused sections.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement and Expectations for the Series:**  \n   - While the book was entertaining and left me wanting to know more about the Carryx, the lack of connection to the human characters and their small-scale struggles detracted from the experience.  \n   - I hope the next two books in the trilogy expand the scope and world-building, as this will determine whether I continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a compelling alien-focused narrative and fast-paced writing, but it struggles with unengaging human characters and a narrow scope. While I was entertained and intrigued by the alien elements, the lack of connection to the human storylines prevented me from fully enjoying the book. My continued interest in the series will depend on whether the next books broaden the world and improve character engagement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5 (rounded down)."

            "Set in a distant future on the planet Anjiin, the story explores humanity's struggle against the Carryx, an alien species that abducts the brightest minds for a deadly competition on their homeworld. This survival first-contact tale is rich in mystery, intrigue, horror, and raw human emotion. While the plot may not be fast-paced or action-packed, it remains deeply engaging and difficult to put down.",
            "The diverse cast of scientists is impressively well-developed, each character rendered with a terrifying realism that makes their flaws relatable. The story intimately explores how extreme stress, trauma, and horror uniquely impact each individual, emphasizing themes of morality and mental health. The inner conflicts and interpersonal drama are compelling, making the characters' struggles and justifications for their actions in survival situations truly fascinating.",
            "This story is lauded for its vivid imagination and scientific depth, though some readers might struggle with the technical details. The narrative is both alien and immersive, keeping readers engaged despite occasional confusion. Notably, the author hints at the ending on the first page while still maintaining intrigue, showcasing a unique and effective storytelling technique.",
            "This novel explores themes of morality, mental health, and the limits of human endurance in extreme conditions. The depiction of the Carryx and the cultural clashes between species is both immersive and unsettling. The inclusion of non-human perspectives, such as the Carryx excerpts and the 'swarm' point of view, adds depth and intrigue, enhancing the sense of looming dread throughout the story.",
            "While I found myself more intellectually captivated than emotionally invested—favoring stories that resonate on a deeper emotional level—I still appreciated the narrative's alien and immersive qualities. Although some aspects were challenging to fully grasp, I remained engaged and excited throughout. The ending left me eager for more, reigniting my interest in the author's other works."

        "conclusion": "The Mercy of Gods is a slow-burn, character-driven alien invasion story that is both epic and intimate, alien and human, horrifying and fascinating. While it may not be fast-paced or action-packed, its deep character work, immersive world-building, and intriguing narrative make it a compelling read. Despite some challenges with the more technical aspects, the story’s unique blend of mystery, horror, and raw human emotion ensures it leaves a lasting impression.",

            "The subplot involving the Night Drinkers was both shocking and unexpected, leaving a lasting impression. However, my experience with Adobe Digital Editions was frustrating, as it caused me to lose many highlighted passages. The story centers on humans on Anjiin coexisting with local flora and fauna, while scientists work to bridge the two biological systems. The discovery of alien ships shifts the narrative toward themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization in the face of a superior, incomprehensible species. The book delves into how humans create and sustain civilization, particularly when confronted with forces they cannot overpower or fully comprehend.",
            "This story's focus on scientists as protagonists is refreshing, and their struggles kept me engaged and theorizing for days. The characters are well-developed, highlighting themes of found family, human connection, and mental health. Jessyn's portrayal of depression and the collective trauma experienced by the characters is particularly compelling. Touching moments, such as Daffyd snapping at Campar yet admitting he never wants the jokes to stop, add depth to their relationships.",
            "The character development is outstanding, particularly in the dialogue between Campar and Jessyn: “It’ll be all right.” / “It won’t.” / “No. But we’ll find a way to be all right with that.” This exchange beautifully encapsulates the story's essence. The academic humor, such as “you need funding, I need funding, we all need funding,” adds a delightful touch of levity. While some elements, like the swarm/spy/thing and the Carryx, were confusing, I've come to appreciate that ambiguity as part of the story's charm.",
            "This sci-fi book initially captivated me, but it diverges significantly from *The Expanse*. It aligns more closely with Daniel Abraham’s solo work while firmly staying within the sci-fi genre rather than veering into fantasy. The narrative is dense, making it a challenging read, but it's not without merit."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenges of maintaining civilization. While it differs from *The Expanse*, it excels in character development, particularly in its portrayal of mental health, trauma, and found family. The story is both challenging and rewarding, with moments of humor and profound insight. Despite some confusing elements, it’s a deeply engaging read.",

However, it didn’t live up to my expectations. While I liked it, it didn’t grab me as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is intelligent and explores interesting themes, particularly the idea of relying on outside factors, which is present throughout the story. The beginning was gripping, especially during the alien attack, but the focus shifted to the scientists' captivity and their adjustment to a new lifestyle. This part of the story, including the experiments they are forced to conduct, felt slow and boring to me.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters each symbolize different ways of handling captivity, which is a thoughtful approach.

This might have been intentional, but it left me feeling less invested.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  As the opening book of a new series, it didn’t start with a bang, but it did pique my interest enough to wonder what will happen next. It feels like the first episode of a TV series—not bad, but I’m hoping the next installments will be more engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel didn’t fully meet my expectations, I still liked it and am curious about where the series will go.

Martin in New Mexico. They are polished professionals who work well together. I find Ty Franck's ritual disclaimer about revealing his address amusing. According to their joint website, both still live in Albuquerque, which is nice but wasn’t my preferred location when I lived in New Mexico.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Style:**  \n  The writing is described as \"good stuff, smooth as the finest whiskey.\" The novel is praised for being \"perfectly paced and smoothly written,\" with a narrative that digs into the core of who people are when stripped of everything by trauma and pressure.\n\n- **Endorsements and Peer Recognition:**  \n  The back-cover blurbs feature high praise from notable authors like John Scalzi, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ryka Aoki, Django Wexler, and Bethany Jacobs, all urging readers not to miss this book. The reviewer echoes this sentiment, stating, \"me too.\"\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  The reviewer gives the book a rare full 5-star rating, calling it \"really, really good\" and even better than *The Expanse* series. They describe their reaction as \"Wow\" and emphasize that this is a classic book not to be missed. They also mention their intention to revisit the book for quotes and further reflection.\n\n- **External Review Reference:**  \n  The reviewer highlights a glowing review by Amal el-Mohtar in *The New York Times*, which praises the book's pacing and depth. They express willingness to share a copy with non-subscribers but question why anyone would need more persuasion to read it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis review is a glowing endorsement of the novel, praising its authors, writing quality, and emotional depth.

            "The plot unfolds primarily through the characters' internal thoughts rather than their actions or interactions, resulting in a tedious reading experience. The pacing is uneven, with the ending feeling both delayed and rushed—an odd combination that ultimately leaves the reader unsatisfied. The initial conflict is uninspired and fails to integrate meaningfully into the larger narrative, rendering it a dull and wasted segment. Although the ending aims to provoke reactions, it lacks real conflict or significant fallout. While it hints at potential future developments, it doesn't provide enough payoff to make this installment satisfying on its own. The narration style, which filters excitement through layers of introspection, makes me hesitant to continue with the series.",
            "The characters felt one-dimensional, and the shifting points of view were repetitive and lacked distinct voices. The romance relied heavily on a female character who had little personality beyond her appeal to men. Additionally, the pivotal decision in the final chapters went unexamined, undermining what could have been a significant conflict.",
            "The worldbuilding fell short, relying heavily on info-dumping rather than immersive storytelling. The aliens, intended to be enigmatic, felt underdeveloped, particularly since the protagonists could predict their reactions with surprising accuracy. Additionally, the repetitive codas hinting at the Carryx's doom became tiresome, especially when juxtaposed with the otherwise uneventful main narrative.",
            "I adjusted my expectations from a space opera to a narrative focused on alien invasion, trauma, and human connections, all seen through the eyes of protagonists with limited knowledge. Unfortunately, the book still fell short of these revised expectations. Both the marketing and the story made certain promises early on that were ultimately unfulfilled, leaving me feeling disappointed and frustrated."

            "The plot follows Dafyd and his friends, who are kidnapped by an alien race and transported to a new world where they must prove their worth or face dire consequences. I found the story refreshingly unpredictable, with twists that kept me on edge and made it difficult to catch my breath.

The only negative for me is that I don’t immediately have the next book to dive into and binge.  \n\n- **Scale and Boldness of the Story:**  \n  This is go-big-or-go-home sci-fi, and I love when series ratchet up the drama to an epic scale with the highest stakes possible. Cixin Liu, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Christopher Ruocchio, and James SA Corey have done this for me before, but none have gone so big so soon like *The Mercy of Gods* did. A+ for boldness.  \n\n- **Non-Human POVs:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of sci-fi is reading from non-human POVs, and that was a standout highlight of this read for me, deployed to perfection intermittently.  \n\n- **Human Ensemble Cast:**  \n  I really like what they did with the human ensemble cast of characters. They’re more subtle character archetypes than what you typically get, which might make them less compelling for some readers compared to the colorful and strong personalities in *The Expanse*. However, I found them riveting in their own quieter and idiosyncratic ways.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  I was basically on the edge of my seat the entire book, utterly gripped by the plot and the various settings we spent time in. Gimme more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold and gripping start to a series, with an epic scale, high stakes, and standout non-human POVs.

            "The story employs multiple third-person limited perspectives, initially introducing a broad range before focusing on six key characters: Dafyd, Jessyn, The Swarm, Tonner, Rickar, and Ekur-Tkalal. The shifting viewpoints are skillfully managed, effectively complementing the book's length and its singular setting.",
            "In this story, the human characters, part of a research team, transition from navigating academic dynamics to grappling with moral and ethical dilemmas in the Carryx prison camp. Dafyd, the nominal protagonist, is a schemer with a broad mindset, quickly adapting to the alien environment. Jessyn, a capable researcher with bipolar disorder, faces significant challenges to her mental health under extreme conditions. Tonner, the brilliant team leader, is slow to recognize the dangers surrounding them, while Rickar, an outsider, offers a more grounded perspective amidst the chaos. The characters' mental health conditions and psychiatric disabilities enhance their relatability and resilience in these extraordinary circumstances.",
            "The prose was expertly crafted and free of errors, reflecting the authors' high standards. The descriptive writing was compelling, and the action sequences matched the quality of their previous works. The dialogue, especially the sharp, concise sentences, was both enjoyable and impactful.",
            "The world-building was impressive, seamlessly integrating hard science fiction with advanced alien technologies. The depiction of the Carryx's brutality and the harsh conditions of the prison camp effectively echoed historical human atrocities. Additionally, the presence of multiple alien species enriched the narrative, adding further depth to the setting.",
            "The story delves into themes of survival, moral dilemmas, and the psychological effects of captivity. The introduction of The Swarm, a nanotech spy, adds an intriguing layer, even if its identity is somewhat predictable. Elements of sex, drugs, and violence are present but are treated with care and context.",
            "I picked up this book anticipating a read akin to *The Expanse*, but it offered a refreshing divergence. The writing team’s high production values and seamless collaboration resulted in polished prose. While the book began with a literary science fiction tone, it gradually shifted to a more familiar style as the story unfolded."

It successfully balances thrilling and chilling elements while setting the stage for what promises to be an emotionally intense and unpredictable journey.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The aliens in this story felt genuinely otherworldly, a refreshing change from the human-like portrayals often seen in modern franchises. The chilling premise of the Carryx compelling humanity into a deadly game added a compelling horror element that enhanced the narrative.",
            "The novel's concept is captivating, set in a distant future where humans have inhabited another planet for over 3,000 years. The story revolves around the advanced alien race, the Carryx, who abduct the brightest humans and compel them to compete in a deadly contest against other alien species, with extinction as the ultimate consequence of failure. This premise evokes comparisons to *Red Rising* and *The Hunger Games*, but with a darker, more scientific edge.",
            "The portrayal of humans felt almost too familiar, which was a slight disappointment. After 3,500 years on another planet, I anticipated more pronounced cultural differences from Earth in 2024.

When I saw James S.A. Corey had a new book coming out, I was thrilled and managed to get an ARC.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story follows a team of intellectual researchers and a few others, like Dafyd, on their home planet of Anjiin. They are suddenly attacked by huge, alien creatures, leading to the deaths of many friends and family members. The survivors are forced to make themselves useful to these alien beings or face death. The central questions revolve around survival, purpose, and the larger implications for humanity.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are well-developed, and we get to know them intimately throughout the book. Notable characters include Tonner, the feisty and slightly pompous head scientist, and Else, his assistant and girlfriend. Dafyd and others also stand out as the story progresses.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing was initially slow, and I considered quitting the book around the 40-50% mark. However, my interest resurged after that point, and the story became compelling and hard to put down.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - The book explores profound themes, such as the meaning of survival when everything you’ve ever known is gone. It raises larger questions about humanity and what grounds us in life.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Creativity:**  \n   - The worldbuilding is immersive and seriously creative, with a smart plot and excellent action scenes.  \n\n- **Comparison to The Expanse:**  \n   - This book is not The Expanse, and I don’t want it to be. It stands on its own with a new crew to root for. While they’re not like James Holden and his crew, I’m beginning to feel for them in their own right.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - Highly recommended! I can’t wait for the next book in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Mercy of Gods is a gripping and immersive novel with strong character development, creative worldbuilding, and thought-provoking themes. Despite some pacing issues early on, the story becomes deeply engaging and leaves me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the reviewer highly recommends the book."

            "This book examines the existence of alien life and their destructive tendencies, particularly through the lens of the Carryx, who dominate the stars and wreak havoc on the human-inhabited planet of Anjiin. It poignantly explores human reactions to upheaval, revealing extremes such as violence, madness, depression, humor, and sexuality. While centered on an alien invasion, the narrative remains profoundly humane, addressing themes of anxiety, insignificance, and the everyday struggles of life.",
            "The story follows a quirky, awkward team of biologists selected by the Carryx, who redefine their situation to view themselves as achievers rather than slaves. With a diverse cast of characters, each offering unique perspectives, the narrative fosters a compelling and dynamic interplay. The book serves as a profound exploration of human instincts, relationships, and primal tendencies.",
            "The narrative is rich and profound, yet it skillfully weaves in humor and the mundane aspects of life, such as eating and washing. This balance between the vastness of the universe and intimate human experiences—like spiraling thoughts and epiphanies about our place in the cosmos—creates a compelling and relatable story.",
            "This book masterfully evokes a spectrum of emotions, balancing the weight of existential insignificance with moments of humor and laughter. It resonates profoundly with themes of uncertainty, inadequacy, and the quest for meaning amid chaos."

        "conclusion": "This novel is an incredible blend of science fiction and human introspection, offering a gripping exploration of alien invasion while remaining deeply relevant to the human experience. Its rich character dynamics, profound themes, and balance of heaviness and humor make it a standout read.",

            "The main characters, being academics, are less relatable than the compelling protagonists of *The Expanse*, such as a spaceship captain and a detective. They come across as one-dimensional and indistinguishable from one another. Their preoccupation with academic politics and research projects renders them unengaging, making it challenging to invest in their stories. While there are a few standout moments, many human-focused scenes feel tedious.",

The narrative centers on a group of biological researchers as they navigate the challenges posed by an alien invasion, detailing their experiences both during and after the event.",

The humans on the planet are unsure how they got there.  \n   - The story follows a group of academic researchers in biology, focusing on their experiences during and after an alien invasion.  \n\n- **Characters and Engagement:**  \n   - The main characters are academics, which makes it harder to connect with them compared to the inherently interesting protagonists of *The Expanse* (e.g., a spaceship captain and a detective).  \n   - The characters felt cardboard-like and hard to distinguish from one another. Their focus on academic politics and research projects made them uninteresting and difficult to care about.  \n   - Human-focused scenes were often a drag, with only a few exceptions.  \n\n- **Alien Elements and Intrigue:**  \n   - The alien forces, the Carryx, are front and center, with dialogue and direct interaction, making them scary, mysterious, and wholly interesting.  \n   - Learning about the aliens and their motives was the most compelling aspect of the book and kept me turning the pages.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing is digestible and not overly dense, making the book a fast read despite some uninteresting plot elements.  \n   - The pacing was quick, and I was mostly entertained, though the human survival story felt dull in comparison to the alien intrigue.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations for the Series:**  \n   - While I was entertained and want to know more about the Carryx, the lack of connection with the human characters and their unengaging storylines prevented me from giving the book a higher rating.  \n   - I hope the next two books in the trilogy expand the scope and focus more on the aliens and the larger world, as this will determine whether I continue with the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a fascinating premise and compelling alien elements, but the human characters and their academic-focused storylines fell flat for me.

            "Set in a distant future on the planet Anjiin, the story follows humans grappling with the threat of the alien Carryx. A group of brilliant scientists is abducted to the Carryx homeworld, where they are thrust into a deadly competition against other captive species. This survival-first contact narrative is rich with mystery, intrigue, horror, and raw human emotion. The plot unfolds slowly, driven by character development and exploring the psychological and moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists.",
            "The diverse cast of scientists is impressively well-developed, with each character depicted as both realistically flawed and relatable. The story intimately explores the impact of extreme stress, trauma, and horror on each individual, emphasizing themes of morality and mental health. The inner conflicts and interpersonal drama are particularly engaging, revealing how people rationalize their actions in the name of survival.",
            "This story is lauded for its vivid imagination and scientific insight, though some readers might struggle with its technical elements. Central themes include morality, mental health, and the limits of human endurance. The introduction of non-human perspectives, like the Carryx and the ‘swarm,’ enhances the narrative with intrigue and a sense of impending dread.",
            "The world-building is profoundly immersive, creating a strong sense of alienness that enhances the story's horror and intrigue. The depiction of the Carryx is especially chilling, while the cultural clashes between species will captivate readers with an interest in anthropology and linguistics.",
            "Although the story isn't fast-paced or action-packed, it remains highly engaging and hard to put down. The narrative is filled with intrigue and mystery, enhanced by occasional shifts in perspective that keep the reader on edge. The ending is tragically fitting and ominously foreboding, leaving me eager for more."

The story’s blend of horror, intrigue, and raw emotion leaves a lasting impression, and its ending sets the stage for an eagerly anticipated continuation.",

            "The story centers on humans living on Anjiin, coexisting with the local flora and fauna while scientists work to bridge the two biological systems. The arrival of alien ships shifts the narrative, introducing themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenge of preserving civilization in the face of a superior species. The book explores how humans build and sustain their societies, particularly when confronted with forces they cannot overpower or fully comprehend.",
            "This story's focus on scientists as protagonists is refreshing, and their struggles kept me engaged and theorizing for days. The book excels in character development, particularly in its exploration of found family, human interaction, and mental health. Jessyn's portrayal of depression and the characters' diverse responses to trauma are deeply compelling. Moments like Daffyd snapping at Campar yet admitting he never wants the jokes to stop are poignant, highlighting the depth of their relationships.",
            "The dialogue in this story is sharp and memorable, featuring lines like, “If there was a war coming, it would find them gardening,” and, “We should field-test it. Invite one of our little friends over for dinner and some light vivisection?” The academic humor, particularly regarding funding, is both hilarious and relatable. The ending, highlighting the interaction between Campar and Jessyn, is beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant: “It’ll be all right.” / “It won’t.” / “No. But we’ll find a way to be all right with that.”",
            "The swarm/spy entity and the Carryx were both confusing yet intriguing, and I've come to accept that not fully grasping alien biology is part of the experience. The Night Drinkers were shocking, and their unexpected role in the story had a significant impact.",

It aligns more with Daniel Abraham’s solo work while firmly staying within the sci-fi genre rather than veering into fantasy. The narrative is dense, making it a challenging read, but it's not unenjoyable."

It's \"really, really good.\"\n  - I plan to revisit the book to find quotes and add more thoughts. Stay tuned.\n\n- **Accessibility and Sharing:**\n  - I'm happy to send a copy to non-subscribers, but the book is so compelling that further persuasion shouldn't be necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a masterfully written, perfectly paced science fiction novel that delves into the core of human identity under pressure. With glowing endorsements from top authors and a smooth, engaging style, it’s a must-read for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed *The Expanse*. A rare 5-star read that I highly recommend.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 5 stars (a rare rating from the reviewer)."

            "The story skillfully employs multiple third-person limited perspectives, initially introducing a broad range before narrowing down to six key viewpoints: Dafyd, Jessyn, The Swarm, Tonner, Rickar, and Ekur-Tkalal. This shifting narrative is well-executed and compact, fitting seamlessly within the 400+ pages. Each of the six main characters is well-developed and integral to the plot, which revolves around themes of survival, espionage, and the moral complexities of imprisonment, particularly in the context of the Carryx’s genocidal war. While the narrative includes elements of sex, drugs, and violence, these are handled tastefully and contextually. The body count is staggering, with billions of humans and numerous aliens perishing, though the depiction of violence remains moderately graphic.",
            "In this story, the human characters, part of a research team, transition from navigating academic dynamics to grappling with moral and ethical dilemmas in the Carryx prison camp. Dafyd, the central protagonist, is a schemer with a broad mindset, quickly adapting to the alien environment. Jessyn, a skilled researcher living with bipolar disorder, faces significant challenges to her mental health in these extreme conditions. Tonner, the brilliant team leader, is slow to recognize the dangers they face, while Rickar, the outsider, offers a more grounded perspective amid the chaos. The inclusion of characters with mental health conditions adds depth and realism to their struggle for survival in such abnormal circumstances.",
            "The prose was expertly crafted and free of errors, reflecting the high standards we expect from these authors. The descriptive writing was compelling, and the action sequences matched the quality of their previous works. Additionally, the dialogue, especially the sharp, concise sentences, was both enjoyable and impactful.",
            "The world-building in this story is impressive, seamlessly merging hard science fiction with fantastical, \"sufficiently advanced\" technologies. The brutal prison camps of the Carryx and the diverse alien species are vividly depicted, evoking parallels to historical human atrocities. However, certain elements, like the instant usability of human lab equipment by aliens, come across as implausible.",
            "I picked up this book expecting a narrative akin to *The Expanse*, but I was pleasantly surprised by its distinctiveness. The writing team’s high production values and seamless collaboration shone through, resulting in polished prose. The story begins with a literary science fiction tone reminiscent of *Station Eleven*, but it gradually shifts to a more familiar style as it unfolds."

        "conclusion": "This book exceeded my expectations, offering a fresh and well-written start. The characters, particularly those with mental health conditions, were compelling and added depth to the story. The world-building was immersive, though some elements felt implausible. I enjoyed the narrative and prose, but I remain apprehensive about the potential length and duration of the story. Overall, it’s a strong entry into the science fiction genre, blending grit, action, and thought-provoking themes.",

The characters, particularly those with mental health conditions, were compelling and added depth to the story. The world-building was immersive, though some elements felt implausible. While I enjoyed the narrative and prose, I remain apprehensive about the potential length and duration of the series. Overall, it’s a strong entry into the science fiction genre, blending grit, action, and thought-provoking themes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Prose and Writing Style: 9/10  \n- Character Development: 8.5/10  \n- World-Building: 8/10  \n- Plot and Themes: 8.5/10  \n- Overall: 8.5/10"

            "The book is thrilling and engaging, particularly with the anticipation of Dafyd becoming a major challenge for the aliens. However, the section where the characters attempt to solve the puzzle drags a bit, mainly due to the unclear outcome.",
            "This book piqued my interest in the characters, especially my desire for the Swarm to find happiness. Typically, it takes me more than one book to fully connect with characters, a sentiment I've experienced with the author's previous works as well. I believe that with another installment and a re-read, my bond with the characters will deepen.",
            "The setting of Anjiin is captivating, featuring humans who have lived on the planet for 3,000 years, oblivious to their origins. The alien species is genuinely otherworldly, creating a significant conflict as humans must shift their perspective to comprehend them. Dafyd emerges as a standout character, exceptionally adept at navigating this alien mindset.",
            "The book thoughtfully examines the psychological impact of trauma, portraying a diverse array of human reactions with empathy and nuance. Although the exploration of trauma can be unsettling, it enriches the narrative and adds significant depth to the story.",
            "The book serves as a promising setup for future installments, particularly with Dafyd's pivotal role in the aliens' downfall. Although the wait for the third book, expected in 2026, feels lengthy, the story's potential keeps me engaged."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a compelling and thought-provoking space opera that balances excitement with emotional depth. While the pacing had a minor slog in the puzzle-solving section, the anticipation of future events and the exploration of trauma make it a strong read. I look forward to the next installment and a potential re-read to deepen my connection to the characters.",

Set in a distant future on a planet where humans have lived for over 3,000 years, the story explores a civilization that has forgotten its origins and faces a severe threat from an alien race, the Carryx. The idea of kidnapped humans being forced to compete against other alien species, with extinction as the price of failure, was both haunting and compelling. It reminded me of *Red Rising* and *The Hunger Games* but with a darker and more scientific undertone.  \n\n- **Alien Representation:**  \n  The aliens in the story felt truly alien, which I appreciated. They didn’t act like humans, which is a common pitfall in many modern franchises. The Carryx were distinct and added a layer of authenticity to the sci-fi elements of the novel.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Twists:**  \n  S.A. Corey did a phenomenal job of consistently adding intriguing layers and twists to the plot. The stakes were incredibly high, and the story had a horror-like quality in parts, particularly the scenario of a sophisticated alien race forcing humanity into a deadly game. This kept me hooked and eager to return to the story.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  While the characters weren’t bad, I didn’t fall in love with any of them. Dafyd, the protagonist, was my favorite, but overall, the characters didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Cultural World-Building:**  \n  The humans in the story felt almost too human, which was a minor disappointment. Given that this civilization has lived on another planet for 3,500 years, I expected more significant cultural differences from Earth in 2024. While there were some differences, they weren’t as substantial as I had hoped. I understand the authors might have aimed to keep the humans relatable, especially since the aliens were so distinctly non-human.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the minor nitpicks, the plot was so compelling that it didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment of the story. I found the novel utterly addictive and would highly recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Mercy of Gods* is a brilliant and captivating sci-fi novel with a haunting premise, well-developed alien species, and a plot full of intriguing twists. While the characters and human cultural evolution could have been stronger, the story’s high stakes and compelling narrative make it a must-read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5  \n\nThanks to Orbit for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

Whether you’re a fan of the author, their collaborative works, or new to their writing, this book is a must-read. I can’t wait to see what’s in store in the next installment!",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Connection to the Expanse Universe:**\n   - Initially, I believed *Mercy of the Gods* was tied to the Expanse universe, though far removed from its familiar elements. However, I later discovered it’s not officially part of that universe, which made me question whether the similarities were imagined or a marketing tactic. Regardless, the subtle tiebacks (real or perceived) were profound and intriguing, and I’m excited to see how future books might explore these connections further.\n\n- **Character Work:**\n   - The authors’ mastery of character work remains unparalleled. They delve into the granular details of what it means to be human, coping with an unsympathetic existence. This brilliance makes me feel deeply connected to the characters on a visceral level. Their ability to slow down events for the sake of connection leaves a lasting impression, reminiscent of Abraham’s fantasy works and even authors like Robin Hobb.\n\n- **Creativity and World-Building:**\n   - *Mercy of the Gods* is a wildly creative experience. The authors threw off constraints and had fun exploring new ideas, resulting in a story that’s slow and gripping, fast and action-packed, and always exciting. The creature creation and exploration of alien biology were particularly satisfying, showcasing the authors’ ability to craft imaginative and immersive worlds.\n\n- **Standalone Nature:**\n   - The book is a 100% self-contained narrative, and you can enjoy it without having read *The Expanse*. However, if you plan to read *The Expanse* in the future, be cautious, as *Mercy of the Gods* contains implications that could spoil certain story arcs in *The Expanse*.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The pacing was a perfect blend of slow, gripping moments and fast, action-packed sequences. The tone was consistently exciting, making it every bit as good as the best of *The Expanse*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Mercy of the Gods* is a wildly creative and deeply satisfying sci-fi novel that showcases the authors’ mastery of character work and world-building. While it’s not officially tied to *The Expanse* universe, its subtle (or imagined) connections add an intriguing layer for fans. Whether you’re a fan of James S.A. Corey, Daniel Abraham, or new to their works, this book is a must-read. I can’t wait to see what’s in store in the next installment!\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5/5 stars"

            "The only issue I had with the book was its pacing. However, around the 40-50% mark, my interest reignited as the story began to take shape, making it hard to put down. The slow start ultimately paid off, as the plot points became clearer and the mystery deepened. The narrative follows a team of intellectual researchers, including Dafyd, on their home planet of Anjiin. Their lives are abruptly shattered when they are attacked by massive alien creatures, leading to the capture of many while their friends and families are killed. Survival becomes uncertain, not just for them, but for everything they’ve ever known. The remaining survivors are confronted by various alien beings with a stark ultimatum: be useful or face death. The high stakes and the mystery of their survival kept me thoroughly engaged.",
            "In this book, while I initially focused on Dafyd, I soon found myself intimately acquainted with all the characters. Tonner, the feisty and somewhat pompous head scientist, and Else, his assistant and girlfriend, are just a couple of examples. Although the deep dive into each character's psyche almost made me consider quitting at first, I ultimately grew fond of them and became deeply invested in their journeys.",
            "The worldbuilding in this story is impressively creative and immersive. The alien creatures, the setting of Anjiin, and the overall universe are fresh and well-developed. The plot is intelligent, and the action scenes are outstanding.",
            "The book delves into profound questions about survival and humanity. What does it mean to endure when everything familiar is lost? If family and friends are gone, what is the purpose of survival? These thought-provoking themes add significant depth to the story.",
            "This series is one of my all-time favorites, both in book and show form. When I learned about the release of a new book, I was ecstatic! I was thrilled to receive an ARC and couldn't wait to dive in."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Excitement:**  \n  The Expanse series is one of my all-time favorites, both the books and the show. When I saw James S.A. Corey had a new book coming out, I nearly squealed! I was thrilled to score an ARC and couldn’t wait to dive in.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows a team of intellectual researchers and a few others, like Dafyd, on their home planet of Anjiin. Suddenly, they are attacked by huge, alien creatures, and many are rounded up while their friends and families are killed. Survival becomes uncertain, not just for them but for everything they’ve ever known. The remaining survivors are tasked by different alien creatures: make yourself useful or die. The stakes are high, and the mystery of whether they’ll survive and succeed kept me hooked.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  While I only mentioned Dafyd by name, we get to know all the characters intimately throughout the book. Tonner, the feisty and slightly pompous head scientist, and Else, his assistant and girlfriend, are just a few examples. The time spent getting inside everyone’s head was crucial, though it initially made me consider quitting the book. However, as the characters grew on me, I became deeply invested in their journeys.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was my only issue with the book. Around the 40-50% mark, my interest resurged, and from there, the story took shape and became something I had difficulty putting down. The slow start was worth it, as the plot points became clearer and the mystery deepened.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The book raises profound questions about survival and humanity. What does it mean to survive when everything you’ve ever known is gone? If your family and friends are gone, what’s the point of surviving? These larger questions added depth to the story and made it more thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Creativity:**  \n  The worldbuilding was seriously creative and immersive. The alien creatures, the setting of Anjiin, and the overall universe felt fresh and well-developed. The plot was smart, and the action scenes were excellent.  \n\n- **Comparison to The Expanse:**  \n  This book is not The Expanse, and I don’t want it to be. While it’s different, it stands on its own with a new crew to root for. They’re not like James Holden and his crew, but I’m beginning to feel for them in their own right. I can’t wait for the next book!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Mercy of Gods is an immersive, thought-provoking, and creatively crafted novel with a smart plot, excellent action scenes, and deeply developed characters. Despite some pacing issues early on, the story ultimately captivated me, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nHighly recommended!

It follows a team of biologists selected by the alien race, the Carryx, to work on the planet Anjiin. The narrative explores human reactions to upheaval, revealing extremes such as violence, madness, depression, humor, and sexuality. While it is a science fiction tale of alien invasion, it remains profoundly humane and relevant, tackling themes of anxiety, depression, insignificance, and the everyday aspects of life.",

            "The story was action-packed but sacrificed worldbuilding for the sake of pacing. While the narrow focus on a small group of characters can be effective, as seen in *Leviathan Wakes*, it fell short here, lacking the sense of a larger, unfolding narrative.",

This was disappointing, especially since character development is typically a strong point in the story. The romance also fell short compared to the Expanse, leaning more towards crushes and kissing, which made it feel unexpectedly juvenile for an adult-targeted novel.",

Much of the first 100 pages is consumed by discussions of academic politics and research, which can feel tedious and uninspiring. The characters often appear one-dimensional and indistinguishable, making it challenging to connect with them or invest in their outcomes. While there are a few standout human-focused moments, many scenes tend to drag.",

Jessyn's portrayal of depression and the characters' diverse responses to trauma are deeply compelling. Heartwarming moments, such as Daffyd snapping at Campar yet admitting he never wants the jokes to stop, add depth to their relationships.",
            "The dialogue is sharp and memorable, featuring standout lines like, “If there was a war coming, it would find them gardening,” and, “We should field-test it. Invite one of our little friends over for dinner and some light vivisection?” The academic humor, particularly regarding funding, is both hilarious and relatable.",
            "The alien biology and the Carryx were intentionally perplexing, which I found intriguing rather than frustrating. The swarm/spy creature was initially baffling but became clearer as the story unfolded. The introduction of the Night Drinkers added an unexpected twist, heightening the tension and surprise throughout the narrative.",
            "This sci-fi book initially attracted me, but it differs significantly from *The Expanse*. It aligns more with Daniel Abraham’s solo work while staying firmly within the sci-fi genre rather than veering into fantasy. The narrative is dense, making it a challenging read, but it's not unenjoyable."

        "conclusion": "This book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenges of maintaining civilization in the face of the unknown. Its strong character work, particularly around mental health and found family, is its standout feature. While the alien concepts and biology were intentionally perplexing, they added to the story’s depth and intrigue. The sharp dialogue and academic humor made the reading experience enjoyable, even if the pacing was slow at times.",

It leans more toward Daniel Abraham’s solo work, though it remains firmly in the sci-fi realm rather than fantasy.  \n   - The book is dense and took me a long time to read, but it’s not bad—just challenging.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The story revolves around humans on Anjiin coexisting with local flora and fauna, with scientists like Tonner Freis and Llaren Morse trying to bridge the gap between human and alien biology.  \n   - The arrival of alien ships shifts the narrative to themes of colonialism, humanity, and the struggle to maintain civilization when faced with a superior, incomprehensible species.  \n   - The book explores how humans create and sustain civilization, especially when confronted with something they cannot overpower or fully understand.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The focus on scientists as protagonists was refreshing, and their struggles and discoveries kept me engaged and theorizing for days.  \n   - The book excels in character development, particularly in its exploration of found family, human interaction, and mental health.  \n   - Jessyn’s portrayal of depression and the characters’ varied responses to trauma were deeply compelling.  \n   - Moments like Daffyd snapping at Campar but admitting he never wants the jokes to stop were heartwarming and added depth to their relationships.  \n\n- **Writing and Dialogue:**  \n   - The dialogue is sharp and memorable, with lines like, “If there was a war coming, it would find them gardening,” and, “We should field-test it. Invite one of our little friends over for dinner and some light vivisection?” standing out.  \n   - The academic humor, especially about funding, was hilarious and relatable.  \n\n- **World-Building and Alien Concepts:**  \n   - The alien biology and the Carryx were intentionally confusing, which I found intriguing rather than frustrating.  \n   - The swarm/spy/thing was initially baffling but became clearer as the story progressed.  \n   - The Night Drinkers were a shocking and unexpected element that added tension and surprise to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a dense, thought-provoking sci-fi novel that explores themes of colonialism, humanity, and the challenges of maintaining civilization in the face of the unknown.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. While I liked it, it didn’t grab me as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel is intelligent, and I appreciated the overarching theme of relying on outside factors, which was present throughout in different scenarios. However, the story’s focus on captivity and adjusting to a new lifestyle didn’t excite me as much as I expected. The beginning was gripping, especially during the alien attack, but the shift to the scientists being forced to conduct experiments for their captors felt tedious and less engaging.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Each character symbolized a different way of handling captivity, which was an interesting approach. However, I didn’t connect deeply with any of them, and none stood out as particularly memorable. This might have been intentional, but it left me feeling somewhat detached.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  As the opening book of a new series, it didn’t start with a bang, but it did pique my interest enough to wonder what will happen next. It feels like the first episode of a new TV series—not bad, but I’ll need a few more installments to see if it truly grabs me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel didn’t fully meet my expectations, I still liked it and am hopeful that the next books in the series will be more engaging.

Although the ending could serve as a springboard for a more engaging story, the narrative style and unfulfilled promises leave me hesitant to continue.",

The story uniquely explores the scientists' experiences as they are relocated and re-educated by the Carryx, offering a rational perspective on the invasion. The introduction of another hidden alien species deepens the mystery, raising questions about the Carryx's motives, their dominance, and their interest in the best and brightest from conquered civilizations.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Investment:**  \n  This was an unbelievably gripping start to a series. I rarely find myself so engaged and invested in a Book 1. The only negative for me is that I don’t immediately have the next book to dive into and binge. That’s it. That’s the only negative.  \n\n- **Scale and Boldness of the Story:**  \n  This is go-big-or-go-home sci-fi, and I love when series ratchet up the drama to an epic scale with the highest stakes possible like this. Cixin Liu, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Christopher Ruocchio, and James S.A. Corey themselves (though the Expanse took longer to get there) have done this for me before, but none that I’ve read have gone so big so soon like *The Mercy of Gods* did. A+ for boldness.  \n\n- **Non-Human POVs:**  \n  One of my favorite aspects of sci-fi is reading from non-human POVs, and that was a standout highlight of this read for me, deployed to perfection intermittently.  \n\n- **Human Ensemble Cast:**  \n  I also really like what they did with the human ensemble cast of characters. They’re for the most part more subtle character archetypes than what you typically get. While I understand if some readers might find them less compelling than the Expanse cast with its handful of colorful and strong personalities, I found them riveting in their own quieter and idiosyncratic ways.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  I was basically on the edge of my seat the entire book, utterly gripped by the plot and the various settings we spent time in. Gimme more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold, epic, and gripping start to a sci-fi series that immediately immerses the reader with its high stakes, unique non-human perspectives, and a subtly compelling human ensemble cast. The only downside is the wait for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nA+ for boldness."

            "The story centers on the survival and moral dilemmas faced by human prisoners, intertwined with a subplot featuring an alien spy, The Swarm, attempting to \"phone home.\" While the identity of The Swarm is somewhat predictable, which is a minor letdown, the plot remains engaging. However, some readers may be disappointed by the limited action, as there is only one brief space battle.",
            "The human characters in the research team are well-developed, with their inner dialogues and motivations evolving in response to the harsh realities of the Carryx prison camp. Dafyd, the nominal protagonist, is a schemer with a broad mind, though he may lean towards sociopathy. Jessyn, a capable researcher living with bipolar disorder, navigates the extreme conditions of the camp while managing her mental health challenges. Tonner, the brilliant team leader, is slow to recognize the dangers and ethical dilemmas they face. Meanwhile, Rickar, the outsider, offers a more grounded perspective amid the chaos. The inclusion of characters with mental health conditions and psychiatric disabilities adds depth, making them relatable in such extraordinary circumstances.",
            "The prose in this book is expertly crafted and free of errors, featuring descriptive passages and action sequences that match the quality of the author's previous work. The dialogue stands out, with concise, impactful sentences enhancing the narrative. The use of six third-person limited perspectives is skillfully managed within the 400+ pages. Overall, this is a strong start, showcasing a fresh story and polished writing. However, I have some reservations about the potential length of the series, as I prefer fewer, longer books to a prolonged multi-book arc.",
            "The world-building in this story is impressive, seamlessly merging hard science fiction with fantastical, \"sufficiently advanced\" technologies. The Carryx's brutal prison camps and the diverse array of alien species are vividly depicted, evoking parallels to historical human atrocities. However, some inconsistencies arise, such as human prisoners using alien lab equipment with ease.",
            "The story delves into themes of survival, adaptation, and the moral and ethical dilemmas surrounding imprisonment. It features tasteful portrayals of both heterosexual and homosexual relationships, alongside moderate violence and the use of alcohol and marijuana in social contexts. The narrative is marked by a high body count, showcasing genocidal violence and moderately graphic depictions of physical conflict.",
            "I picked up this book expecting a narrative akin to *The Expanse*, but I was pleasantly surprised by its distinctiveness. The writing team has maintained their high production values, showcasing a polished prose that reflects their tight, experienced collaboration. The story begins with a literary science fiction tone reminiscent of *Station Eleven*, but it gradually shifts to a style more familiar to fans of the author’s earlier works."

While it shares some stylistic elements with the authors’ previous work, it stands on its own as a compelling start to a new story. The inclusion of characters with mental health conditions added depth, and the narrative was both gritty and thought-provoking.

            "The book is thrilling and engaging, particularly with the buildup of Dafyd as a formidable threat to the aliens. However, the section where the characters tackle the puzzle drags a bit, mainly due to the uncertainty of the outcome.",
            "This book drew me in on a more personal level, especially regarding the Swarm, whose happiness I genuinely cared about. Typically, it takes me more than one book to fully connect with characters, a pattern I've noticed in the author's previous works as well. I believe that with another installment and a re-read, my bond with the characters will grow even stronger.",
            "The setting of Anjiin is captivating, featuring humans who have lived on the planet for 3,000 years without knowledge of their origins. The alien species is genuinely otherworldly, with thought processes that starkly contrast with those of humans, establishing a central conflict. Dafyd emerges as a standout character, adept at understanding and adapting to the alien mindset.",
            "The book thoughtfully examines the psychological effects of trauma, portraying a diverse array of human reactions with empathy and nuance. Although the exploration of trauma can be unsettling, it enriches the narrative, adding realism and depth to the story.",
