            "From the very first chapter, the story captivated me, making it hard to put down. However, the shift from enemies to reluctant allies felt too sudden; I craved more tension and conflict between Layla and Elise. Additionally, the mystery aspect seemed scattered and confusing, leaving me uncertain about its execution. The ending felt abrupt, with several unresolved threads, but I was pleased to learn that a sequel is in the works.",
            "**Elise Saint:** My feelings about her were mixed. I could relate to her struggles and admired her growth, yet her moments of privilege and occasional annoyance stood out. Her complex family dynamics and caring nature towards her sister were portrayed well.  \n**Jamie:** Despite his limited screen time, Jamie was a charming character. His humor and friendship with Layla added a delightful dynamic, and I hope to see more of him in the future. The enemies-to-lovers arc between Layla and Elise was engaging, though I wished their initial hostility lasted longer. Their dynamic balanced angst and tenderness perfectly, and I eagerly anticipate their future romance.",
            "The writing was immersive and emotionally resonant, vividly portraying the characters' inner struggles and connections. The sharp exchanges between Layla and Elise particularly stood out as a highlight.",

The enemies-to-lovers trope is particularly engaging here, as the two characters were once best friends, adding depth to their animosity. The complex mix of unspoken emotions between them gradually transforms into a palpable sexual tension, showcasing their undeniable chemistry. The romance stands out as the highlight of the book, and I appreciated the shifting perspectives that enriched the narrative. Additionally, I found one of the villains intriguing, especially Elise’s father, and I wish she had received more focus. I'd love to learn more about her backstory as a reaper!",

While I wished for a deeper exploration of vampirism, I appreciated the experiments introduced toward the end and the scientific elements of the world.

Are there only reapers or other creatures too, and are they all man-made?  \n\n- **Villains and Supporting Characters:**  \n   - I was enticed by one of the villains and wish she took more of a focus from Elise’s father.  \n   - I’d love to know more about her story as a reaper!  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**  \n   - I think this was a strong debut and would definitely recommend it to fans of vampires.  \n   - I enjoyed the different take on vampirism, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from the author!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Ravenous Fate* is a compelling queer vampire novel with a unique take on vampirism, strong character dynamics, and an intriguing world. While I wished for more exploration of the supernatural elements and certain characters, the romance and tension between Layla and Elise were standout features. This debut is a must-read for fans of the genre, and I’m excited to see what the author does next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The supporting characters, however, remain one-dimensional and stereotypical, reminiscent of cardboard figures from classic gangster films—particularly the obnoxious, childish younger sister and the emotionally distant mother. The romance, the story's most anticipated element, disappoints, as the banter feels forced and awkward, resulting in minimal chemistry.

Overall, the writing has an amateurish quality, resembling mere placeholders rather than fully developed scenes. Additionally, the excessive repetition of terms like \"lair\" and \"gangster\" detracts from the narrative.",
            "The world-building in this story is insufficient, as the rules governing the vampires (reapers) are neither clearly explained nor developed. While there are intriguing hints about their origins, they lack the depth needed to be truly engaging. The 1920s setting, particularly during the Harlem Renaissance, feels underutilized and adds little to either the plot or atmosphere, coming across as bland and generic rather than capturing the vibrancy of the era. Additionally, the characters' dialogue and behavior seem anachronistic, resembling modern individuals rather than authentic figures from the 1920s.",

            "The plot centers on a false cure and the use of reapers as weapons, a common trope in fantasy that occasionally feels contrived. The investigation that brings Elise and Layla together seems more like a plot device than a natural development. The ending is rushed, relying on monologues to summarize events, and Valeriya’s death feels abrupt and underwhelming. The sudden tone shift in the final chapters is jarring, leaving the resolution feeling flat. The execution of the story has significant room for improvement, particularly regarding pacing. Key character traits and relationships lack depth, and better integration of Elise’s OCD hints earlier on would enhance consistency in character motivations. Overall, the story could benefit from more careful editing and development.",
            "**Elise:** I find Elise to be a compelling character, particularly in her struggle with perfectionism and anxiety. However, her relationship with her father appears inconsistent; he belittles her yet she clings to the belief that he loves her, which contradicts his behavior. Additionally, her OCD is introduced abruptly, and I wish there had been earlier hints to foreshadow this aspect of her character. Elise's decision to replace her sister as the heir could have been a more significant showcase of her perfectionism.\n\n**Layla:** Layla is an intriguing character who chooses not to mourn her death, instead focusing on forging a new identity. Her avoidance of her past and emotional confrontations adds depth. However, her relationships, particularly with Elise, feel underexplored. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic lacks depth, and Layla's motivations for rekindling feelings for Elise are unclear. Similarly, her connection with Mei only becomes evident late in the story, leaving their relationship feeling flat.",
            "The political structures of the Saint Empire feel underdeveloped and lack coherence. Important questions regarding the empire's operations, relationships with other entities, and the hierarchy among reapers remain unanswered. Expanding on these elements would enrich the worldbuilding and elevate the stakes of the story. Currently, the politics serve more as set dressing than an integral part of the narrative."

However, her relationship with her father feels inconsistent. He constantly belittles her, yet she believes he loves her deeply, which doesn’t align with his actions. Her OCD is introduced abruptly, and I wish there had been more subtle hints earlier in the story. Her decision to replace her sister as the heir could have been a stronger demonstration of her perfectionism.\n   - **Layla:** Layla is an intriguing character who refuses to mourn her own death, focusing instead on building a new identity. Her avoidance of her past and her tendency to run away from emotional confrontations are compelling. However, her relationships, especially with Elise, feel underdeveloped. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Layla and Elise lacks depth, and Layla’s reasons for rekindling feelings for Elise are unclear. Her relationship with Mei also falls flat, with little indication of their connection until late in the story.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The plot revolves around a false cure and using reapers as weapons, which is typical for fantasy but feels contrived at times. The investigation that brings Elise and Layla together feels like a plot device rather than a natural progression. The ending is rushed, with monologues summarizing events and Valeriya’s death feeling abrupt and underwhelming. The tone shift in the final chapters is jarring, and the resolution feels flat.\n\n- **Politics and Worldbuilding:**\n   - The political structures of the Saint empire are underdeveloped and lack coherence. Key questions about the empire’s operations, relationships with other entities, and the hierarchy among reapers are left unanswered. Fleshing out these aspects would enhance the worldbuilding and raise the stakes of the story. The politics feel more like set dressing than an integral part of the narrative.\n\n- **Race and Class:**\n   - The story is set during the Harlem Renaissance, but the handling of race and class is clumsy. While there are moments where these themes are addressed, they are not woven seamlessly into the narrative. The discussions feel isolated and lack depth, particularly in relation to human-reaper interactions. I suspect this is due to editorial constraints rather than the author’s intent.\n\n- **Execution and Editing:**\n   - The execution of the story has room for improvement. The pacing, particularly in the ending, feels rushed, and certain character traits and relationships are not fully developed. The editors could have done a better job of integrating hints of Elise’s OCD earlier and ensuring consistency in character motivations and relationships.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I enjoyed the concepts, themes, and characters in this novel, but the execution fell short in several areas.

            "The investigation into Theo's death serves as little more than background noise instead of a compelling driving force. Lacking urgency and on-page development, the outcome feels underwhelming. Additionally, the absence of red herrings or twists renders the mystery predictable.",

Their initial friendship is underdeveloped, leading to a lack of depth in their evolving relationship. The chemistry between them often seems superficial, primarily driven by lust, especially evident in scenes where Elise allows Layla to drink her blood. Elise's late confession of love comes off as unconvincing and poorly timed. Additionally, writing and pacing issues hinder a deeper connection with the characters, while the emotional stakes and urgency of their situations are not effectively conveyed.",

Pacing is uneven due to clunky writing and significant gaps that disrupt the flow. In the final 50 pages, an overload of new elements and plot points is introduced without adequate setup, resulting in a rushed and confusing conclusion.",
            "The slow-burn romance between Elise and Layla stands out, featuring a well-crafted friends-to-enemies-to-reluctant allies-to-lovers arc that effectively builds tension and emotional depth. Layla's perspective is particularly engaging, thanks to her jaded, scandalous vampire persona and her propensity to challenge Elise's prejudices. Elise's OCD adds complexity to her character, enriching the narrative. The dynamic between Elise, a musician, and Layla, a dancer, is compelling, though a scene of Layla dancing to Elise's music would enhance the story. Mr. Saint starts as a chilling character with unstable moods but ultimately becomes an inconsistent antagonist. Similarly, Liam, who is portrayed as a vicious gangster, comes off as embarrassingly ineffective and lacks credibility. The characters' passive reactions, such as their indifference when witnessing reapers feeding on another reaper, dilute the stakes and weaken the world-building.",

The reapers—vampiric beings born from 17th-century medical experiments—are a captivating concept.

The story could have taken place in any time or location without significant changes.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book was painfully boring and slow-paced, with little happening to keep the reader engaged.\n   - Despite its flaws, the book has potential, and others might enjoy it, especially fans of black sapphic vampire stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the premise of the book was promising, the execution fell flat. The plot was slow and predictable, the characters were either infuriating or forgettable, and the romance lacked depth and development. The setting was underutilized, and the overall experience was tedious. However, the book has potential, and fans of the genre might find some enjoyment in it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5/5"

            "The plot progressed at an excruciatingly slow pace, with excessive focus on interactions and descriptions that ultimately detracted from the main narrative. The mystery was poorly crafted, as the identity of the true villain and their accomplice was glaringly obvious, lacking any real sense of urgency despite the high body count. Additionally, the ending felt unsatisfying—not as a lead-in for a sequel, but rather due to the story's lack of direction and failure to resolve key questions.",
            "The sapphic romance between Layla and Elise felt rushed and lacked the necessary development for a believable enemies-to-lovers arc. However, Elise's relationships with her sisters stood out as a highlight, showcasing genuine love and dynamic interactions. Unfortunately, Elise's father embodies a clichéd YA trope, with the sheltered protagonist oblivious to his true nature, offering nothing fresh to the genre. Additionally, the side characters were one-dimensional and underdeveloped, making it difficult to remember their names or care about their roles.",
            "The book would have benefited from further editing, as repetitive phrases and verbs, such as \"reapers biting their lips until they bled,\" became distracting. The prose lacked clarity, leading to confusion about various aspects of the story. Additionally, the tone was inconsistent, oscillating between elegant language and casual phrasing, which felt jarring.",
            "The atmosphere lacked immersion despite its Harlem Renaissance setting. The Black characters did not recognize their historical parallels with the reapers (vampires), diminishing the intended social commentary. Furthermore, the reapers were neither frightening nor engaging, and their portrayal as societal outcasts felt underdeveloped and poorly executed.",
            "The attempt to parallel the oppression of the reapers with the historical struggles of Black people felt heavy-handed and ultimately fell flat. Additionally, the subplot involving doctors experimenting on reapers was both disturbing and poorly executed, particularly as the Black characters appeared complicit in this oppression without any significant reflection or resistance."

        "conclusion": "While *This Ravenous Fate* had potential, it ultimately fell short due to poor editing, inconsistent tone, slow pacing, and underdeveloped characters. The social commentary felt forced and poorly executed, and the unresolved ending left me unsatisfied. Despite enjoying the sisterly dynamics, the book’s flaws outweighed its strengths, making it a disappointing read.",

The mystery was minimal, and the motivations for the main characters to collaborate felt underdeveloped.",

Consequently, Elise’s apology feels unearned and insufficient, leading to an unsatisfying resolution in their relationship.",

The narrative often spoon-fed information, leaving little room for interpretation or discovery.

Jamie and Mae were delightful in their brief appearances, adding charm to the story. \n\nWhile the relationship between Layla and Elise started strong, it lost its chemistry as the narrative progressed. I found myself sympathizing more with Layla, especially regarding her parents’ death and her transformation into a vampire.

As a result, Layla's interactions with her fangs and her dynamic with Mae became far more engaging than her relationship with Elise.",

I found the science behind the reapers fascinating and would love to delve deeper into their powers and abilities.",

            "Elise Saint, the responsible eldest daughter of the Saint family, and Layla, her former friend who has become a Reaper, form the core of the narrative. Their relationship is well-crafted, showcasing a tangible chemistry. However, despite their engaging interactions, I didn't feel completely immersed in their storyline. The incorporation of a vampire fantasy trope featuring POC characters within a Harlem backdrop is a notable highlight, offering a refreshing perspective that complements the narrative beautifully.",
            "Set against the vibrant backdrop of 1920s Harlem during the jazz era, this novel immerses readers in a unique atmosphere enriched by rival gangs and the lively rhythms of the time. The intriguing premise of Reapers—vampires that haunt the neighborhood—and the Saint family's role in combating them adds depth to the story. Particularly captivating are the special bullets crafted by the Saint patriarch to eliminate Reapers and the enigma surrounding certain Reapers' transformation back into humans, which enhance the world-building and keep the reader engaged."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The novel is set in the 1920s Harlem jazz era, which provides a unique and vibrant backdrop. The inclusion of rival gangs and the jazz vibe adds depth to the atmosphere. The concept of Reapers (vampires) plaguing the area and the Saint family's business of dealing with them is intriguing. The special bullets created by the Saint patriarch to eradicate Reapers and the mystery of some Reapers turning back into humans were particularly compelling elements of the world-building.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Elise Saint, the dutiful older daughter of the Saint family, and Layla, her former friend turned Reaper, are the two main characters. Their dynamic is well-written, with good chemistry between them. However, while their interactions were engaging, I found myself not fully drawn into their story.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The book moves at a slower pace, which made it difficult for me to stay consistently engaged. I often found myself leaving the story and struggling to reconnect with it.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The inclusion of a vampire fantasy trope featuring POC characters and the Harlem setting is a standout feature. It adds a fresh perspective to the genre and feels perfectly suited to the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Sequel:**  \n  The novel ends with a clear opening for a second book, suggesting that this installment serves as foundational world-building for the next. I am looking forward to the continuation of the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Ravenous Fate* has some strong elements, such as its unique setting, intriguing world-building, and well-written characters, the slow pacing made it challenging for me to stay fully engaged.

Their visits to various locations, intended to yield insights, leave them with little to show for their efforts.

            "The book presents several intriguing ideas; however, it suffers from a lack of cohesion and poor editing. The pacing is uneven, with backstory details sometimes assumed to be known by the reader. Frequent mini time-skips overlook important character moments and conversations. Additionally, the partnership between Elise and Layla in investigating a murder feels unrealistic and contrived. The plot, which weaves together themes of politics, a cure, and rivalries, ultimately fails to fully unite and remains somewhat predictable.",
            "The character actions and development in this story often lack coherence, with emotional responses to significant events—such as deaths—being insufficiently explored. Villains are portrayed as overly caricatured and lacking depth. While the depictions of Elise’s OCD and Layla’s reaper nature stand out as highlights, other emotional arcs fall flat. The book features queer characters but fails to engage with their identities, missing a valuable opportunity for exploration. Although social issues like racism and classism are addressed, the absence of discussions surrounding queer identity is stark. A flippant comment from Elise’s mother about their relationship feels misplaced and undermines the emotional gravity of the scene.",
            "The writing lacks consistency, with attempts at humor often falling flat and occasional verbose or overly descriptive passages. Numerous errors in word choice and grammar indicate a need for more thorough editing. While a few lines are beautifully crafted, such moments are exceptions rather than the rule.",
            "The world-building is lacking, and the 1920s New York setting feels insufficiently developed. The atmosphere fails to capture the decadence, richness, and darkness that one would expect from a vampire story set in Harlem during this era. Additionally, the historical and linguistic elements come across as too modern, undermining the authenticity of the 1920s backdrop."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel shows promise with its intriguing premise, strong central relationship, and unique elements like Elise’s OCD and Layla’s reaper nature. However, it suffers from weak world-building, inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped emotional arcs, and a lack of engagement with queerness. The writing and editing need significant improvement, though the audiobook performance is mostly enjoyable. Despite its flaws, the book has potential, and I would be willing to read a follow-up if the issues are addressed.",

A significant death was abruptly introduced in the last five pages, lacking buildup or meaningful impact, making it feel random and unsatisfying—especially considering it involved one of the universe's most powerful characters.

The predictable villain adds to the story's shortcomings, lacking the complexity one hopes for.

Despite its potential, the novel ultimately feels lackluster and boring, especially in the second half.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "Set in 1920s Harlem, the story follows Elise, a reluctant heiress, and Layla, a reaper—this world’s version of a vampire—as they join forces to unravel a mystery linked to their past. The book is highly engaging and kept my attention throughout, though some sections felt slow. Ultimately, I believe it could have benefited from being about fifty pages shorter to enhance the pacing. I'm pleased it's a duology, ensuring the story remains concise and does not feel unnecessarily prolonged.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story is set in 1920s Harlem and follows Elise, a reluctant heir, and Layla, a \"reaper\" (this world’s version of a vampire), as they team up to solve a mystery tied to their past.  \n   - The book is compulsively readable and kept me engaged most of the time. However, some parts felt slow, and I think it could have been about fifty pages shorter to improve the pacing.  \n   - I’m glad it’s a duology, so the story won’t be unnecessarily dragged out.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Elise and Layla are well-developed characters, and I enjoyed their dynamic. There was a lot of tension between them, especially in the beginning, and I liked how their relationship evolved throughout the book.  \n\n- **World-Building and Lore:**  \n   - I was intrigued by the concept of reapers and wished there had been more exploration of the lore. Some parts of the story felt like they wasted time on less interesting elements instead of delving deeper into the reaper mythology.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - I listened to the audiobook, and while the narrator did a great job overall, it was sometimes hard to distinguish between the main characters because their voices didn’t change much. I’d recommend paying close attention to who is speaking if listening to the audio version.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This was a fun book, and I’m excited to read the sequel and other works by this author. I think the target audience will love it, and I’m thrilled about the resurgence of vampire stories in literature.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Ravenous Fate* is an engaging sapphic vampire story with compelling characters and an intriguing premise.

            "Set against the vibrant backdrop of 1920s Harlem, an era rich with jazz and clandestine clubs, the story follows Elise Saint, a reaper—once human, now a vampire—who returns from France to fulfill her duties as the heir to the Saint family Reapers. As murders plague the city, Elise finds herself unjustly blamed, but the truth is more complicated. The narrative delves into Elise's journey of self-discovery as she grapples with the consequences of abandoning her dreams to save her sister. With a steady pace, the plot gradually reveals its mysteries while the immersive worldbuilding highlights the fantasy elements intertwined with the intricate details of Harlem's vibrant setting.",

The character dynamics are captivating, especially the evolving relationship between Elise and her former best friend, which transforms from friendship to enmity. The slow-burning romance complements the narrative without overshadowing the main plot, allowing the action and mystery to remain front and center. Every character feels fully realized, striking a perfect balance without anyone appearing underdeveloped or exaggerated.",

It delves into themes of identity, sacrifice, and moral complexity, particularly through Elise’s conflicting emotions about her past and her present responsibilities."

While its pacing and focus on worldbuilding may not suit all readers, those who appreciate a detailed, immersive experience will find it highly rewarding.

            "The plot concludes messily, seemingly paving the way for future installments. The book feels rushed and underdeveloped, leaving its potential largely unrealized.",
            "In this story, the protagonist Elise is underdeveloped and lacks distinct character traits. Her portrayal of OCD feels superficial and poorly integrated, as it is only mentioned briefly and seems like an afterthought.",
            "The dialogue feels awkward and fails to capture the essence of the 1920s setting, lacking historical accuracy—particularly in its use of terms like \"compulsions\" for OCD. Additionally, the novel falls short in its descriptions, which is especially disappointing in a romance where character appearances are pivotal. The main characters are only vaguely described, with minimal details like a green dress and pearl necklace provided.",
            "The 1920s Harlem setting feels underutilized and largely irrelevant to the plot. The dialogue, fashion, and descriptions do not effectively capture the essence of the era. In fact, the story could easily be transplanted to a different time period without sacrificing key plot points.",
            "The premise of the book is captivating, and the author's promotion adds to its appeal. It effectively highlights themes such as the romance between two Black girls, the friends-to-enemies-to-lovers dynamic, and the intersection of classism and racism alongside reapers."

The sapphic vampire (Reaper) theme is both refreshing and skillfully woven into the historical setting. The dark, glamorous aesthetic of the era is beautifully depicted, immersing readers in a vivid world. However, the rules governing the dynamic between Reapers and humans remain somewhat vague, which detracts from the overall fantasy experience. Additionally, the Reapers lack the dark and seductive qualities commonly associated with vampires, which may disappoint genre enthusiasts.",
            "The author employs vampires, or Reapers, as a compelling allegory for division within the Black community, delving into themes of assimilation, authority, and resistance. A striking quote encapsulates this commentary: *That was exactly how white people controlled minority groups; by making themselves out to be graceful saviors everyone was lucky to have. But there was nothing lucky about being forced to assimilate just for a chance of being given rights that you already deserved in the first place.* This insight emphasizes the novel’s profound social critique."

            "The story held great promise, especially with its exploration of the reaperhood's origins and the relationship between Layla and Elise.

The plot felt predictable, with the characters showing little urgency to uncover the truth. Additionally, the villains were one-dimensional, lacking any real complexity or intrigue.",

While the gory tone enhanced the vampire theme, it didn’t fully transport me to the intended era. Additionally, the writing was repetitive, featuring overused phrases like \"empire\" that made the book seem unnecessarily lengthy and tedious. The slow pacing turned the reading experience into a chore.",

            "The relationship between Layla, a reaper (vampire), and Elise, the girl she attempted to kill on the night of her transformation, is intense and multi-faceted. Their bond, once a deep friendship, has deteriorated into hatred due to past events. When a newborn reaper commits murder and Layla is blamed, she is compelled to join forces with her former friend-turned-enemy to save herself and her clan. As a fan of the enemies-to-lovers trope, I am particularly captivated by the complexity of best friends morphing into enemies before potentially rekindling their romance.",
            "I adore vampire books for their unique settings and compelling characters. The genre's captivating allure always draws me in, especially its spooky, atmospheric vibes. *This Ravenous Fate*, set in 1920s Harlem during Prohibition, perfectly encapsulates this. The era's speakeasies and shadowy streets create a dark and mysterious backdrop, rife with the potential for danger, as if someone could vanish without a trace.",
            "I love that this is a queer BIPOC vampire story, and its release just before Halloween adds to its charm. It's refreshing to see such representation in the genre, and I genuinely hope it garners the recognition it deserves.",
            "*This Ravenous Fate* offers a captivating blend reminiscent of Netflix's *First Kill* and Renee Ahdieh's *The Beautiful*, yet it surpasses both with its unique and unforgettable qualities. This book is not just engaging; it's truly exceptional."

The genre itself is captivating, and I’m always drawn to the spooky, atmospheric vibes. This book, *This Ravenous Fate*, is set in Harlem during the roaring 1920s, a time when prohibition was in full swing and speakeasies were the go-to spots for a secret fix. The setting is perfect for the genre—dark, mysterious, and full of potential for danger, like someone being snatched off the street unnoticed.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The dynamic between Layla, a reaper (vampire), and Elise, the girl she tried to kill the night she turned, is intense and layered. What was once a deep friendship has turned into hatred due to past events. When a newborn reaper kills someone, Layla is blamed, forcing her to team up with her worst enemy to save herself and her clan. I’m a huge fan of the enemies-to-lovers trope, but best friends to enemies to lovers? That’s next-level and absolutely captivating.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I adore that this is a queer BIPOC vampire story, and the fact that it was released right before Halloween adds to its charm. It’s refreshing to see such representation in the genre, and I truly hope it gets the recognition it deserves.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Originality:**  \n  If you were to mix Netflix’s *First Kill* and *The Beautiful* by Renee Ahdieh, you’d get something similar to this book, but *This Ravenous Fate* stands out as even more incredible. It’s unique, gripping, and utterly unforgettable.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I loved every second of this book! The story, characters, and setting all came together perfectly, and I’m already eagerly anticipating the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Ravenous Fate* is an amazing, atmospheric vampire novel with a richly developed setting, complex characters, and a captivating enemies-to-lovers dynamic.

            "The frequent shifts in perspective and the head-hopping in the chapters often caused my attention to waver while reading. The plot didn’t truly engage me until about 60% into the story, and even then, I found myself anticipating a twist that felt predictable, or simply waiting for it to conclude. While I personally would have preferred a shorter narrative, I can see how those who enjoy the book might appreciate its length.",
            "I found Layla more engaging than Elise, though I can't complain about a childhood friends-to-enemies-to-lovers sapphic vampire story. At times, their motivations were unclear, and I struggled to connect deeply with any character. However, I did appreciate the tender moments shared between the two leads and the supporting cast.",
            "For a debut, the writing is impressive and polished. I would confidently recommend this story to readers without hesitation.",
            "The mystery plot lacked significance, and I found myself disengaged from the fates of Theo, the other reapers, and the enigmatic clinic.",

            "The middle of the book stands out as its best section, particularly the moments when Elise and Layla, despite being enemies, begin to connect. The scene where they drink blood together is especially memorable. However, the ending was disappointing. The latter part of the plot felt forced, with characters merely stating what needed to happen instead of engaging in meaningful dialogue, which diminished the story's complexity and made it feel contrived. The pacing was uneven, with Act 2 being the strongest, followed by a significant drop in quality in Acts 3 and 4. This decline was particularly disheartening given how much I enjoyed the earlier sections. The rushed and unsatisfying conclusion left me with mixed feelings about the book as a whole.",
            "Elise and Layla truly stood out in Act 2, my favorite section of the book. However, their character development became inconsistent in the latter half. Elise's father came across as flat, and her sudden indifference toward Sterling felt uncharacteristic and unexplained. Additionally, the enemies-to-lovers trope was poorly executed; the shift from animosity to attraction felt too abrupt and lacked emotional depth.",
            "As the book progressed, the writing style lost its sophistication. The dialogue, particularly in the final quarter, became overly simplistic and lacking in depth. Some scenes felt cringeworthy, marked by awkward language and unnatural pacing. For instance, the flirty banter between Elise and Layla seemed incongruous given their history and the brief duration of their relationship's development.",
            "The book effectively tackles racism in a historically accurate way, enhancing the story's depth and making the world feel more authentic. This treatment of the theme is commendable and something I hope to see more in fantasy literature.",
            "While the story features engaging moments, certain scenes, like the jail sequence, closely resemble those in *Arcane*, which detracts from its originality and pulls me out of the narrative. Additionally, the mystery plotline felt superfluous and uninteresting, diminishing my overall enjoyment of the book."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a solid debut novel with some standout moments, particularly in Act 2.

However, the writing style became less sophisticated as the book progressed, and the ending was disappointing. While I enjoyed parts of the book, the uneven pacing, lack of originality in some scenes, and inconsistent character development made it a mixed experience. I’m still curious enough to consider reading the next installment, but I hope the issues I had with this one are addressed in the follow-up.",

            "The setup of the story was engaging, featuring a classic dynamic of two characters who despise each other yet share a rich history. The first half effectively immerses the reader in the vibrant Harlem of the 1920s and the intriguing reaper scare. However, around the halfway mark, the plot loses its momentum, with revelations and the climax coming off as anticlimactic and poorly executed. Valeriya's death and the portrayal of heightened stakes felt disappointing and lacked emotional weight. Despite the story’s serious tone, it failed to deliver any truly shocking or unpredictable moments.",
            "Elise and Layla's initial dynamic was compelling, marked by genuine hatred and tension. However, Sterling's character felt underutilized, especially given his potential for depth. His abrupt turn against Elise seemed inconsistent and disrespectful. The side characters often came across as mere chess pieces, lacking active roles in the story. Valeriya's traumatic experience was frustratingly summarized in a single paragraph, which undervalued her character. Additionally, the motivations and narration of the characters were predictable and repetitive, lacking depth. While the romance between Elise and Layla started off engaging with conflict and reconciliation, Elise's apology felt inadequate given the weight of their relationship. Although hints of emotional complexity were present, they were not fully explored.",
            "The writing effectively conveys events and features moments of brilliance, such as the comparison of Elise to stars and the universe. Some lines, like the one addressing holiness in mundanity, demonstrate great potential but remain underdeveloped. While the historical context and racial themes are well-integrated, they are only explored at a surface level.",
            "The 1920s Harlem setting and the reaper scare were compelling and effectively integrated in the first half of the story. While the themes of racial bigotry and politics added depth, they remained underexplored. The concept of reaperhood as a looming threat was intriguing but only briefly addressed."

This was engaging and promising.\n   - The first half of the book was compelling, especially the exploration of the 1920s Harlem setting and the reaper scare.\n   - The plot became weaker around the 50% mark, with revelations and the climax feeling anticlimactic and poorly executed.\n   - Valeriya's death and the handling of higher stakes were disappointing and lacked impact.\n   - The story took itself seriously but failed to deliver shocking or unpredictable moments.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Elise and Layla's initial dynamic was delicious, with genuine hatred and tension.\n   - Sterling's character was underutilized, especially given his potential for complexity. His sudden shift against Elise felt disrespectful to his character.\n   - Side characters felt like chess pieces rather than active participants in the story.\n   - Valeriya's traumatic experience was dismissed in a single paragraph, which felt disrespectful to her character.\n   - The characters' motivations and narration were predictable and repetitive, lacking depth.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance between Elise and Layla was fun initially, with fighting, hurt, and eventual reconciliation.\n   - The apology from Elise to Layla felt insufficient, especially given the gravity of their relationship.\n   - The emotional depth and complexity of their relationship were hinted at but not fully explored.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing was generally effective in relaying events but had moments of brilliance, such as the comparison of Elise to stars and the universe.\n   - Some lines, like the one about holiness in mundanity, showed great potential but were not fully developed.\n   - The historical context and racial themes were well-integrated but explored only at a surface level.\n\n- **Setting and Themes:**\n   - The 1920s Harlem setting and the reaper scare were intriguing and well-utilized in the first half.\n   - The racial bigotry and political themes added depth but were not fully explored.\n   - The premise of reaperhood as a ticking bomb was interesting but only briefly touched upon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel had a strong start with an engaging setup, compelling characters, and an intriguing setting. However, the plot weakened significantly in the second half, with anticlimactic revelations and underdeveloped character arcs. The romance and themes showed potential but lacked depth and exploration. While the writing had moments of brilliance, the overall execution fell short of expectations. The historical and racial contexts were promising but not fully realized, leaving room for improvement in the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Plot Development: 6/10\n- Characterization: 5/10\n- Romance: 7/10\n- Writing Style: 7/10\n- Setting and Themes: 8/10\n- Overall: 6.5/10"

            "I wished for Mr. Saint to play a more central role in the evil plot, as the idea of a collective mastermind felt less convincing than a singular villain. Additionally, the breakup in the final twenty pages came across as rushed and forced.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, especially Elise. The internal and external conflicts between the two main protagonists and their living situations were highly engaging. Their dynamic was compelling, and I appreciated the forced proximity trope as Elise and Layla, two former best friends, teamed up to solve a murder.",
            "The world-building felt insufficient. Although I appreciate the 1920s aesthetic, it lacked depth; the story could easily have been set in any other decade. It only touched on typical 1920s elements like jazz clubs, prohibition, and fashion trends. Additionally, some of the dialogue came across as overly modern.",
            "I appreciated how the story used reapers (vampires) to explore themes of racial and class divisions. However, at times, the message felt a bit too overt, and the portrayal of white characters seemed overly sympathetic. Additionally, there was an imbalance between telling and showing, particularly regarding the depiction of discrimination.",
            "The premise of vampires set in 1920s Harlem is unlike anything I've ever encountered, contrasting sharply with the usual full fantasy or realism I expect. I found the plot engaging and intriguing, and I'm genuinely glad I stepped outside my comfort zone to explore this unique story!"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Premise and Plot:**\n   - The premise is unlike anything I have ever read! Vampires in 1920s Harlem, New York, is a bonkers concept compared to what I’m used to (either full fantasy worlds or full realism). I found the plot engaging and intriguing. Overall, I was really glad I dove into something outside my comfort zone!\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - I loved the characters, particularly Elise. The internal and external conflicts between the two main protagonists and their living situations were very engaging. Their dynamic worked well, and I enjoyed the \"forced proximity\" trope where Elise and Layla, two ex-best friends, had to work together to solve a murder.\n\n- **Stakes and Tension:**\n   - The stakes were awesome. Having two protagonists gave me a sense that one of them could die, and there wasn’t extreme plot armor on either of them. I was glad this didn’t end up being a \"bury your gays\" trope. I was totally engrossed by the characters, their pasts, and their progression in solving the murder.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building was lacking. While I love the 1920s aesthetic, I needed more. The story could have taken place in any other decade, as it only mentioned stereotypical aspects of the 1920s (jazz clubs, prohibition, fashion trends). Some dialogue felt very modern at times.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - I liked that the reapers (vampires) were used to tackle conversations around racial and class divisions. However, it felt a little on the nose at times, and it almost seemed like white people were being too nice in the story. There was too much telling and not enough showing when it came to discrimination.\n\n- **Villain and Plot Resolution:**\n   - I wanted Mr. Saint to be more involved in the evil plot. It felt unrealistic that the mastermind was a collective rather than one person. The breakup within the last 20 pages felt rushed and forced.\n\n- **Personal Preferences:**\n   - The gore made me squeamish, and I felt sick at times. For the audiobook, scene changes needed to be made more clear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I had a fun time with this book and would recommend it! It has its issues, but the story and characters are interesting and engaging. I will definitely be coming back for the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4/5"

            "The plot is engaging yet ultimately feels contrived, especially towards the ending. While the mystery the characters seek to unravel is quite simple, the author complicates it unnecessarily, resulting in moments that rely on deus ex machina solutions.",
            "The dynamic between the two heroines, Elise and Layla, is captivating, featuring a well-crafted slow-burn romance filled with longing. Their relationship stands out but occasionally overshadows their connections with others. The interactions with supporting characters, like Elise and Sterling or Layla and Valeriya, feel underdeveloped. As the story progresses, these relationships change significantly but lack sufficient exploration and introspection from the heroines. Consequently, by the end, it appears that they prioritize their own desires, overlooking other meaningful connections.",
            "The Harlem Renaissance setting is vividly portrayed, immersing readers in the vibrant atmosphere of the interwar jazz era.",
            "The book offers a unique and creative take on reapers, exploring their origins and coexistence with humans, setting it apart in the saturated vampire genre. The diverse cast, featuring non-white main characters, refreshes the narrative and challenges traditional tropes."

            "The conflict between Elise and her father seemed forced and could have benefited from deeper development for added believability. The action toward the end was difficult to follow, causing my attention to wane after a pivotal conflict, making the last 45 minutes of the audiobook a struggle. However, the plot itself is thrilling and fast-paced. The author skillfully incorporates themes of racial tension and systemic oppression, enriching the narrative. The interplay between reaper clans and reaper hunters provides an intriguing dynamic that enhances the overall story.",
            "The sapphic romance between Layla and Elise truly delivered. Their friendship is genuine and forms a strong basis for their romantic connection. While the chemistry between them initially seemed weak, it grew more compelling as the story unfolded. However, Elise's parents, especially Mr. Saint, were frustratingly insufferable. He came across as a one-dimensional stereotype, resembling a typical Black male villain, and his exaggerated portrayal detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "The historical background of the reapers is compelling and seamlessly integrated, providing a clear and accessible lore that effectively sets the stage for the story. While the setting aims to evoke 1920s New York, it ultimately falls short of capturing the era's essence, feeling more contemporary despite references like the Cotton Club."

While there are some issues with characterization, setting, and pacing, the story shows immense potential, and I’m eager to see how the series develops.",

            "The plot was generally solid, but the story spent excessive time on scene-setting, detracting from the central mystery. As the narrative progressed, the mystery began to resemble a Scooby-Doo episode, with character motivations becoming muddled and inconsistent. The romantic connection between the main characters felt forced and lacked chemistry, especially when compared to their interactions with side characters. The final confrontation with the all-powerful reaper was resolved too swiftly and unconvincingly, making it feel like a hasty choice. Additionally, Elise’s abrupt decision to sacrifice her best friend, despite their strong bond, seemed random and out of character.",
            "In the final quarter of the book, nearly every character experiences a jarring and unrealistic personality shift. Elise’s father, portrayed as unnecessarily cruel, behaves in ways that contradict his supposed intentions to help her. Similarly, Elise's questionable decision-making undermines her credibility as the mystery solver. Layla's actions are also inconsistent; despite her earlier warnings to Elise about her father, she inexplicably chooses to trust him in the story's climax.",

The author tried to incorporate numerous tropes, but they didn’t quite work. Additionally, the lore and rules of the fantasy world felt underdeveloped and didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romantic subplot was a letdown. It took the main characters about 400 pages to share their first kiss, which felt excessively slow. While I enjoy a slow-burn romance, this one dragged on too long and lacked sufficient chemistry to make the payoff satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise, its execution, world-building, and romantic subplot didn’t live up to my expectations. The pacing and lack of chemistry between the characters made it a disappointing read overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The chapters suffered from inconsistent structure, often feeling overly long, and the point-of-view switches within them were jarring. Act Two dragged on without much progression, leading to uneven pacing. Unfortunately, the plot and themes lacked the depth needed to maintain my interest. The book showed promise but ultimately fell flat in its execution. While the blurb and the author’s online presence initially captivated me, the story ultimately failed to meet my expectations.",
            "The chemistry between the main characters, Layla and Elise, fell flat. I was drawn in by the vampire-human lesbian dynamic but left feeling unfulfilled. Their interactions felt forced, and the enemies-to-lovers trope was poorly executed. In contrast, the romance between Mei and Layla, while unexpected, exhibited stronger chemistry. The side characters lacked depth; although Mei was likable, she felt insignificant and was ultimately killed off. Sterling, initially a laid-back character, became inconsistently portrayed. On a positive note, Jamie and his cat son added some much-needed humor.",
            "The dialogue often felt stilted, functioning more as exposition than as authentic character interaction. Layla’s lengthy monologues, in particular, were heavy on information. While the prose had its strong moments, the frequent repetition of terms like \"gangster\" and \"lair,\" along with the constant use of full names (e.g., Tobias and Analia Saint), became distracting. The phrase \"eyes darkened\" was overused at first but thankfully disappeared midway through Act Two, which was a welcome relief."

While there were a few enjoyable moments and decent prose, the lack of chemistry between the main characters, underdeveloped side characters, unnatural dialogue, and uneven pacing made it a struggle to finish. The potential was there, but the execution fell short. I hope my next vampire-themed read will be better.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Chemistry:**\n   - The chemistry between the main characters, Layla and Elise, was lacking. I came for the vampire-human lesbian dynamic but felt unsatisfied. Their interactions felt forced, and the \"enemies to lovers\" trope was poorly executed.\n   - The romance between Mei and Layla, though unexpected, had better chemistry than Layla and Elise.\n\n- **Side Characters:**\n   - The side characters were underdeveloped. Mei was likable but felt insignificant and was eventually killed off. Sterling started off as a chill character but became inconsistent.\n   - Jamie and his cat son provided some humor, which was a positive note.\n\n- **Dialogue:**\n   - The dialogue felt unnatural, often serving only to inform the reader rather than feeling like genuine character interactions. Layla, in particular, had long, exposition-heavy monologues.\n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**\n   - The prose was decent in some parts, and there were moments I enjoyed. However, the overuse of words like \"gangster\" and \"lair,\" as well as the repetitive use of full names (e.g., Tobias and Analia Saint), was distracting.\n   - The phrase \"eyes darkened\" was overused initially but disappeared midway through Act Two, which was a relief.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The chapters were inconsistently structured, often too long, and the point-of-view switches within chapters were jarring.\n   - Act Two dragged on without much happening, which made the pacing feel uneven.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The overall plot and themes weren’t compelling enough to hold my interest. The book had potential but was poorly executed.\n   - The blurb and the author’s online presence initially drew me in, but the story failed to meet my expectations.\n\n- **Positive Highlights:**\n   - The designs for each act page were visually appealing.\n   - The ends of Act Two and Act Three briefly piqued my interest, though these moments were fleeting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a disappointment, especially as someone who is usually easily entertained. While there were a few enjoyable moments and decent prose, the lack of chemistry between the main characters, underdeveloped side characters, unnatural dialogue, and uneven pacing made it a struggle to finish. The potential was there, but the execution fell short. I hope my next vampire-themed read will be better.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

For example, Elise busts her head open and goes home, but there’s no comment from her parents about her head gushing blood.\n   - I’m a details person, and this book was lacking them.\n\n- **Character Relationships and Chemistry:**\n   - I was more convinced there was a romance between Layla and Hendricks the cat than between her and Elise.\n   - Their actions made absolutely no sense to me, and their chemistry was all over the place.\n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**\n   - I was hopeful about the setting being an integral part of the story, but it felt like an afterthought.\n   - I would have loved to see more of the historical aspects of 1920’s Harlem woven in.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll in all, this just wasn’t my kind of book!

            "Review: \n\nLayla's trust in Stephen Wayne and her optimism about the cure seem at odds with her cynical nature and understanding of reaper history. Similarly, Elise's decisions—partnering with Stephen, injecting Sterling, and killing Valeriya without consulting Layla—lack motivation and feel out of character. Tobias’s motivations remain unclear, especially regarding his alliance with Valeriya and his plan to manipulate both Layla and Elise. \n\nElise’s absence of guilt over her promise to kill Layla is unrealistic given their shared history, which isn’t convincingly depicted. A flashback illustrating the night Layla became a reaper and attacked Elise could have added emotional depth. Their efforts to communicate and reconcile feel inadequate, rendering their banter and subsequent romance rushed and unearned. Furthermore, Elise’s indifference toward her father for his role in Layla’s transformation and her parents’ deaths feels inconsistent. \n\nOverall, Layla and Elise's romance would have benefitted from deeper development, with a delayed culmination to make it feel more authentic.",
            "The story suffers from a lack of descriptive detail, making it difficult to visualize the settings. The narrative perspective fluctuates between close and omniscient third person, resulting in an inconsistent tone. While there are occasional anachronisms and modern dialogue, they don't detract significantly from the reading experience. However, the narration tends to tell rather than show, leading to awkward and inorganic expository dialogue. Although individual scenes are fast-paced, the overall plot unfolds slowly, with some moments lacking suspense and buildup. The depiction of emotional abuse is handled well, and while the portrayal of OCD is good, it feels underutilized. Moments of brilliance in the prose are often overshadowed by these shortcomings.",
            "The Harlem Renaissance setting failed to create an immersive experience, lacking specific cultural details such as music from Black musicians and distinctive Harlem fashion trends. References to ballet suggested a misunderstanding of the art form. While the idea of enslaved people becoming reapers was intriguing, it remained underexplored, missing a chance to deeply address themes of exploitation and abuse. Additionally, the conversation around racism and slavery felt minimized, likely due to external pressures, which represented a significant missed opportunity."

            "The plot is intriguing and filled with exciting elements; however, the pacing is slow, especially given the murder mystery and race against time at its core. The urgency of the mystery feels diminished, which undermines the overall tension. Additionally, the last few chapters are confusing and lack adequate buildup, leaving the resolution abrupt and difficult to fully understand.",

The supporting cast, including Sterling (the friend/brother), Mei (whose age-gap relationship with Layla brings complexity), and the unforgettable cat-dad gangster, are vivid and well-crafted. Elise’s father serves as a compelling antagonist, successfully evoking the reader's disdain. Additionally, the dynamics between Elise and her family, especially regarding her father and deceased sister, are intriguing and expertly written.",
            "While the writing occasionally lapses into repetition, using familiar scenes and vocabulary, the pacing also falters. Some chapters drag due to an excessive focus on Elise’s internal thoughts, which can feel redundant. The transition from enemies to lovers lacks smoothness, as Elise’s change of heart appears sudden and lacks sufficient buildup. Additionally, the romantic tension varies, with certain moments felt powerful while others seem disconnected or underdeveloped.",
            "The sapphic pairing of a vampire and a vampire hunter is captivating and beautifully executed. The exploration of themes such as childhood friendship, found family, toxic family dynamics, and the characters’ complementary dreams of music and dance enriches the narrative. The plot's intrigue deepens with elements of murders, secrets, gangsters, scientists, and the pursuit of a potential cure for vampirism. Additionally, the political undertones add significant depth and engagement to the story."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Concept and Themes:**\n   - The sapphic vampire/vampire hunter pairing was perfect and highly appealing.\n   - The themes of childhood best friends, found family, toxic family dynamics, and complementary dreams (music and dance) were well-executed.\n   - The inclusion of murders, secrets, gangsters, vampires, scientists, and greed around a potential cure for vampirism was intriguing and well-integrated.\n   - The political elements added depth and were incredibly engaging.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - The characters were a standout aspect of the book. Elise and Layla were unique and well-developed, with Layla having a darker edge that was appreciated.\n   - Side characters like Sterling (the friend/brother), Mei (though her relationship with Layla was problematic due to the age gap), and the cat dad gangster were memorable and well-crafted.\n   - Elise’s father was a compelling antagonist, evoking the intended hatred from the reader.\n   - The dynamics between Elise and her family, particularly her father and dead sister, were especially interesting and well-written.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The plot was cool and packed with exciting elements, but the pacing felt slow, especially for a story involving a murder mystery and a race against time.\n   - The murder mystery aspect didn’t feel as central or urgent as it should have, which detracted from the overall tension.\n   - The last few chapters were confusing and lacked proper buildup, making the resolution feel abrupt and hard to fully grasp.\n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**\n   - The writing was repetitive at times, with certain scenes and vocabulary feeling overly familiar.\n   - The pacing was inconsistent, with some chapters dragging due to excessive focus on Elise’s internal feelings, which often felt redundant.\n   - The transition from enemies to lovers was not smooth, with Elise’s change of heart feeling sudden and lacking buildup.\n   - The tension in the romance was inconsistent, with some moments being strong but others feeling disconnected or underdeveloped.\n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n   - Strengths: The originality of the ideas, the well-crafted characters, and the exploration of family dynamics.\n   - Weaknesses: The repetitive writing, slow pacing, and lack of smooth transitions in the romance and plot development.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book had a lot of potential with its unique concept, engaging characters, and intriguing plot elements. However, the execution fell short in terms of writing quality, pacing, and the development of the romance. Despite these flaws, it was an enjoyable read, and I remain hopeful for the author’s future works. If you’re a fan of sapphic vampire stories, it’s worth your time.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars as a gesture of support and encouragement for the author."

            "The plot captivates with a deadly conspiracy that bears significant consequences for both reapers and the United States. Its fast pace keeps readers hooked, often allowing the story to be completed in just two sessions. However, some plot points and character actions come across as contrived and serve more as plot devices than as natural developments.",
            "In this engaging tale, Elise Saint, the privileged heir to an empire devoted to eradicating vampires (reapers), encounters Layla, a vengeful reaper determined to retaliate against Elise's family. Their contrasting backgrounds—the ease of Elise's life versus Layla’s tumultuous transformation into a reaper—create a compelling dynamic. Layla’s acute awareness of societal double standards adds depth to her character. The novel features a diverse cast, each with distinct personalities and subplots, making it easy to follow their intertwined journeys. Notably, Jamie, a supporting character, shines and is poised for a significant role in the series to come.",
            "The vivid descriptions effectively immerse readers in the world and the lives of the characters. However, some character dialogues feel stilted, resembling plot narration rather than natural conversation, which can be distracting. Despite these minor issues, the writing is impressive for a debut novel.",
            "This captivating vampire novel unfolds in 1920s Jazz Age Harlem, following two queer Black women as they confront their tumultuous past to protect their loved ones. The rich worldbuilding creates a vivid and authentic backdrop, enhancing the depth of the narrative.",
            "This novel adeptly explores themes of privilege, racism, and loyalty. Elise's wealth shields her from much of the world's racism, while Layla's strength as a reaper provides her with a unique form of protection. The narrative intricately examines the complexities of identity and power dynamics in a racially charged environment."

While it has some minor flaws in dialogue and plot execution, the strong characterizations, engaging plot, and thoughtful exploration of themes make it a standout read.

            "The main plot presents several implausibilities. For instance, it's hard to believe that Layla wasn't executed immediately after her capture, especially as the prime suspect with no other leads. It's also illogical for Mr. Saint to assign the inexperienced Elise to lead such a crucial investigation, given his concern for appearances. Furthermore, the lack of supervision during the investigation—with Elise working alongside Layla, who had attempted to kill her twice—feels unrealistic. Layla could easily have eliminated Elise and escaped, leveraging her connections. The story lacks a sense of closure, and I was surprised to find that it wouldn't resolve by the end. While I enjoyed the book overall, I'm uncertain about reading the next installment, though I will keep an eye on the author's future works.",
            "The relationship between Layla and Elise felt clichéd, reminiscent of Caitlyn and Vi from *Arcane*. At times, the dialogue seemed to borrow directly from the series, which was disappointing. Elise was particularly frustrating; her frequent breakdowns and sensitivity to minor setbacks contradicted her supposed strength, making her character inconsistent. Layla was passable, but I didn’t have strong feelings about her either way. Sterling and Mr. Saint were unlikable, and I wouldn't mind if they faced unfortunate outcomes.",
            "The book's pacing was engaging, holding my interest from start to finish. As a debut novel, the writing was solid, despite some ARC readers pointing out various errors. I found the prose generally strong, although a few dialogues felt a bit corny or forced."

            "The plot is decent, though some sections feel drawn out. I found the term \"reapers\" for vampires somewhat off-putting, often defaulting to calling them vampires in my mind. While I agree that the villain and ending were predictable, which some reviews point out, I believe it's acceptable for a YA novel to be easier to guess. However, introducing red herrings felt unnecessary. Just because we, as readers, know the identity of the villain doesn't mean the characters should, particularly someone as sheltered as Elise. It doesn't quite fit her character; we have access to all the clues, making it easier for us to connect the dots before she does.",
            "Layla truly stole the show for me—her rage, determination, and conviction are masterfully portrayed. Reading her struggles felt like listening to a friend's heartfelt confessions, making her come alive as a real person. I couldn’t help but empathize with her. In contrast, Elise didn’t capture my interest; I often found myself eager to return to Layla's story. Additionally, I wouldn’t classify their relationship as a classic enemies-to-lovers trope. Instead, it’s more accurately described as rivals-to-lovers or fallen-out-friends-to-lovers. I get that publishers and reviewers often lean on buzzwords, though.",
            "The writing is skillfully executed, with the author adeptly using descriptive language to tell the story. It's not overly dense with prose, which suits the narrative well. Overall, it reads similarly to a young adult novel."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*This Ravenous Fate* is a good read and easily fits into my sapphic vampire collection. I will be reading the second book whenever it comes out, and I look forward to the future books the author will write as well.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I both listened to the audiobook and read it physically, depending on which I had more time for. Overall, it was a good read, and I quite enjoyed it. However, there are some lulls where scenes could have been trimmed down or left out altogether. I think one more round of editing would have served the book well, but I’m just a reader, not a professional author.  \n\n- **Main Characters:**  \n  Layla is more like Bae-la—I LOVED her so much! Her rage, determination, and conviction were so well done. It felt inspired and raw, and I thought Layla was a real person. Reading about her struggles and thoughts was like listening to a friend detail their strife. You couldn’t help but feel for her. On the other hand, I didn’t care much for Elise. I found myself wanting to get back to Layla as soon as possible. Also, they are not enemies-to-lovers, as some have described. They are more rivals-to-lovers or fallen-out-friends-to-lovers. I understand that publishers and reviews use buzzwords, though.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is well done. The author knows how to tell a story through her descriptors. It’s not very prose-heavy, which is completely fine. It reads about as well as a YA novel does.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot is decent but drawn out in some areas. The vampires being called reapers never really stuck with me, so I found myself calling them vampires in my head. The reviews that say the bad guy/ending was predictable are correct, but again, it’s a YA novel, and I think it’s okay for it to be easy to guess. I don’t think there was a need to add several red herrings just for the sake of it. The fact that we, as readers, know who the villain is doesn’t mean the characters can or should. Especially someone as sheltered and involved as Elise—it made less sense. We see all the information and perspectives, so of course, we’re going to spot the clues before the characters do.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  Around Act 4, Chapter 42, the audiobook has a moment where it sounds like papers shuffling or the narrator hit a key on their keyboard. It’s not a huge deal, but I heard it and thought some of my papers had fallen off my desk.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Ravenous Fate* is a good read and easily fits into my sapphic vampire collection. I will be reading the second book whenever it comes out, and I look forward to the future books that Hayley Dennings will write as well.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded to 4 stars)"

Vampires, or reapers, are both hunted and permitted to coexist in relative peace, leading to contradictory rules regarding their treatment and interactions with humans.

            "This story boasts an excellent concept, set in 1920s Harlem, where Elise and Layla, once close friends, become adversaries following Elise's betrayal, which transforms Layla into a vampire (or reaper). The premise of ex-friends compelled to collaborate in unraveling the mystery of reapers reverting to humanity is captivating."

The mystery the characters are trying to solve lacks clarity at times, and certain elements, such as Elise's father and his business partner's sinister agenda, take too long to unfold. Additionally, the pacing feels slow, particularly in the middle of the book.",

Layla’s experiences with trauma and PTSD are depicted with remarkable depth, making her a standout figure. Elise’s struggle with OCD and her path to self-discovery are also engaging, though I yearned for a deeper examination of her compulsions. Layla's motivations are particularly strong; her desire to embrace her humanity despite being a reaper adds significant emotional resonance to her narrative. The portrayal of mental health issues, including OCD and PTSD, is handled with sensitivity and authenticity. \n\nThe slow-burn romance between Layla and Elise is beautifully executed, culminating in Layla's realization that Elise isn’t responsible for her past. Their banter is engaging, though I would have appreciated more exchanges. While the romance unfolds gradually, with key developments occurring near the end, this pacing may feel sluggish for some readers.",

Humans have devised ways to control them through peace treaties and special steel bullets. Elise Saint, the daughter of the bullet's inventor and a music prodigy, returns home after years in France to reluctantly take on her role as heir to her father's empire. Layla Quinn, her ex-best friend turned reaper, is falsely accused of murder and must work with Elise to solve the crimes. Political tensions and unresolved personal conflicts add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - **Representation:** The book features LGBTQ+ representation in the main characters.  \n  - **Themes:** The author effectively addresses racial and sexual discrimination, as well as the unethical medical treatment of Black people, weaving these themes into the story.  \n  - **Accessibility:** The book is easy to read, avoiding the complexity of high fantasy.  \n  - **Setting:** The 1920s vibe is well-captured, adding to the atmosphere.  \n  - **Romance:** The romantic elements feel natural and well-integrated into the plot.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - **Terminology:** The choice to call vampires \"reapers\" feels unnecessary and confusing.  \n  - **Character Development:** Valeriya, the reaper clan leader, has a rich history with the city but is underutilized in the story.  \n  - **Character Complexity:** Elise's father comes across as stereotypical and lacks depth. Additionally, his decision to appoint Elise's 10-year-old sister as heir feels unrealistic given her bubbly and carefree personality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book is an engaging read with strong representation, thoughtful themes, and a well-executed 1920s setting.

            "The story is intense, bloody, and suspenseful, featuring a captivating duo of female protagonists—a human and a reaper—who work together to uncover mysterious deaths in the city. However, it does have its slow moments, and certain chapters could have been trimmed without sacrificing the overall intensity.",
            "This novel offers commendable representation of Black and queer characters, which I truly appreciated. It’s refreshing to see such diversity in a vampire story. Layla, the reaper, stands out as a particularly compelling character. Although she has had to suppress many aspects of her humanity to survive, remnants of her human nature still shine through. The emotional depth of the story is enhanced by the dynamic between Layla and Elise, her childhood friend, as they navigate their shared history while unraveling a mystery.",
            "Set in 1920s Harlem, this book creatively integrates vampires, called reapers, into its rich narrative. It tackles historically accurate themes like segregation, racism, and classism, impacting both humans and reapers alike. The inclusion of prohibition further enhances the historical backdrop, enriching the story's depth and giving it an almost historical fiction feel.",

It’s refreshing to see diverse characters in a vampire story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is intense, bloody, and suspenseful, with the two female main characters (one human and one reaper) teaming up to solve mysterious deaths in the city.

Despite having to shut off many aspects of her human life to survive as a reaper, she retains traces of her humanity. The dynamic between Layla and Elise, her former childhood friend, adds emotional depth as they unravel their shared history while solving the mystery.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  The book balances tension and suspense with emotional exploration, particularly in the relationship between the two main characters.

            "While I don't expect extensive world-building in a YA novel, this book lacked sufficient depth in both its setting and character development. Although it addressed issues of racial divide and disparity, the narrative felt more like a summary of these themes than an immersive exploration.",
            "The dialogue felt somewhat flat, lacking the depth and natural flow that could have enhanced the story. Additionally, I found the audiobook narration by Tamika Katon-Donegal to be overly dramatic, which didn't resonate with me, even if some listeners appreciated it. I personally preferred reading the book in print.",
            "Despite its flaws, the book was a quick and enjoyable read, with an engaging story that kept me hooked until the end. While some of my reading friends chose to abandon it, I persisted and finished it.",

The enemies-to-lovers trope adds an engaging layer to the murder mystery. While the premise is strong and could have resulted in a standout YA novel, it ultimately caters to readers seeking a quick, enjoyable read without a focus on execution. It’s a fit for those who appreciate vampires and queer representation and aren't overly critical of the narrative."

            "Although the premise held promise, the story ultimately fell short of delivering a cohesive narrative. Valeria's defeat felt contrived and left the resolution unsatisfying.",
            "The two main characters were well-developed and engaging, but the supporting cast lacked depth and often came across as caricatures. Relationships were at times confusing, particularly Sterling's dynamic with the protagonist, which shifted between sibling-like and romantic. Valeria, though depicted as powerful and ancient, did not effectively showcase her abilities and was defeated too easily. Elise's father was inconsistently portrayed, abruptly shifting from a seemingly loving parent to a villain, despite his true nature being somewhat predictable. Additional characters like Josie, Elise's mother, and Mae felt underutilized and served little purpose in the narrative.",
            "The novel showcases significant potential with its innovative vampire-human romance that avoids an age gap. The Reapers serve as a metaphor for marginalized groups facing discrimination, enriching the narrative. Additionally, the portrayal of the supposed cure and its testing resonates with the Tuskegee trials, adding a thought-provoking layer to the story."

The 1920s Harlem Renaissance setting combined with a reaper (vampire) outbreak created a unique and captivating backdrop.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The story centered around two amazing characters: Elise, the oldest child of a reaper-hunting empire, and Layla, her former childhood best friend turned reaper. Their dynamic shifted from friends/lovers to enemies and back to friends/lovers, which was incredibly compelling. Even as enemies, they knew each other deeply and knew exactly how to hurt one another. Watching them rediscover each other was beautiful.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery at the center of the story was intriguing. Vicious reaper attacks occurred, but the reapers somehow turned back into humans after death. This raised fascinating questions about the future of the country concerning reapers. Both Elise and Layla brought unique perspectives to this problem, adding depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book included thought-provoking discussions on race during the 1920s, which were seamlessly paired with the reaper storyline. Layla, as a Black woman, was already dehumanized by the white society of the city, and her transformation into a reaper further marginalized her. The parallels between Black reapers being used as test subjects and the historical exploitation of Black humans added a heavy but well-handled layer to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the vampire elements, and the enemies-to-lovers trope. The book was a fantastic read, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel masterfully blends historical context, supernatural elements, and complex character dynamics. The exploration of race, identity, and humanity within the framework of a gripping mystery and a reimagined Harlem Renaissance setting made for an unforgettable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The transitions between scenes felt rough, and the story didn’t flow well initially.  \n\n- **Descriptions and Show vs. Tell:**  \n   - The author could have used more descriptions, especially in the beginning.

The sapphic longing was palpable, and I felt every ache between these characters.  \n\n- **Editing and Typos:**  \n   - There were a few typos throughout the story, which were noticeable but didn’t detract too much from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite the rough beginning and minor issues, I would definitely recommend this book as a must-read for anyone looking for more sapphic content. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next book in the series!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book took me on an emotional roller coaster.

I’m a big fan of sapphic vampires, and honestly, who wouldn’t be?  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Unfortunately, I didn’t connect with the author’s writing style. It felt like they were still finding their voice, which is understandable since this is a debut novel.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The world-building didn’t work for me. It felt underdeveloped and didn’t fully immerse me in the story.  \n\n- **Character Writing:**  \n   - The character writing was also a miss for me. It didn’t feel compelling or well-rounded.  \n\n- **Overuse of Metaphors:**  \n   - The constant use of the \"saint\" metaphor was incredibly frustrating. It was overused to the point of exhaustion, and every time I read the word \"saint,\" my brain just shut down. Referring to Elise as \"saint\" and repeatedly using the phrase \"you're a saint\" became so annoying that it detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n   - The plot felt messy and unclear. I struggled to understand the end goal or direction of the story.  \n\n- **Backstory Integration:**  \n   - The backstory felt disconnected from the present events. It didn’t flow well or add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Final Act:**  \n   - The last third of the book completely lost me. I couldn’t anticipate anything that happened, and it didn’t feel like a clever plot twist—it just didn’t make sense.  \n\n- **Positive Elements:**  \n   - On a positive note, I really enjoyed the blood-drinking scenes. The homoerotic tension in those moments was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the premise and some specific scenes, the overall execution fell short for me. The overused metaphors, messy plot, and disconnected backstory made it hard to fully enjoy the book. I’m unsure if I’ll read the second installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Later, she visited my favorite bookstore, and I was thrilled to grab a signed copy.  \n\n- **Relatability and Emotional Connection:**  \n  Reading this book felt like reading through a life that mirrored mine. I immediately felt connected to Elise and her struggles as if they were my own.  \n\n- **Representation and Diversity:**  \n  I must applaud Hayley for undauntedly writing LGBTQ+ stories and making the majority of her characters Black or POC. This has to be one of the first times I’ve read a Black story as the forefront and not just a side story. Thank you for advocating this book and its BLACKNESS.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  It was genuinely a fun read and a tear-jerker with a heart-sinking ending.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I can’t wait to read what’s next in Elise and Layla’s story and cheer her on as a fellow Black LGBTQ+ woman.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a deeply personal and emotional experience for me, offering both relatability and powerful representation. It was a fun yet heart-wrenching read, and I highly recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND"

Aside from a few references to speakeasies, the setting feels more contemporary than 1920s, with characters speaking like modern teenagers and wearing floor-length gowns that seem out of place. Notably, societal homophobia—an important element in 1926—is entirely missing. While I didn't want to read about homophobia, its absence diminished the setting's realism. Overall, the narrative resembles a fantasy or romantic fantasy that would be better suited to an original world rather than a historical backdrop. \n\nHowever, the worldbuilding is a standout feature. The portrayal of vampirism through \"reapers\" is delightfully gory and innovative. I enjoyed the details about reaper blood, their unique strengths and weaknesses, and other intriguing elements.

It’s refreshing to see a romance between two Black girls, which feels rare and exciting.  \n\n- **Writing and Structure:**  \n   - The story felt convoluted, messy, and confusing. While I understand that the ARC version may have some clumsy writing moments, the overall structure could have benefited from a rewrite or two to tighten things up.  \n   - Characters' motivations often seemed arbitrary and changed abruptly to suit the plot, which was frustrating.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Setting:**  \n   - The book didn’t feel like historical fiction. Aside from a few mentions of speakeasies, there was little to ground it in the 1920s.  \n   - The characters spoke like contemporary teens (e.g., using phrases like \"her ex\") and wore \"floor-length gowns\" to parties, which felt out of place.  \n   - Societal homophobia, which would have been a significant factor in 1926, was entirely absent. While I didn’t necessarily want to read about homophobia, its absence made the setting feel less authentic.  \n   - Overall, the story reads more like a fantasy/romantasy that should have been set in its own original world rather than in a historical context.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The worldbuilding was a highlight. The take on vampirism (\"reapers\") was delightfully gory, fascinating, and fresh.  \n   - I loved the details about the properties of reaper blood, their physical strengths and weaknesses, and other unique elements.  \n   - I would have liked to see even more worldbuilding and hope Book 2 delves deeper into this aspect.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance was average, about what I typically expect from YA. It was readable, and I lukewarmly supported the idea of the characters ending up together.  \n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n   - I felt like there was a good story buried somewhere in *This Ravenous Fate*, but it needed more care and attention to fully bring it to life.  \n   - I’m curious to see how Book 2 turns out and hope it builds on the potential of the first installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Ravenous Fate* has an intriguing concept and strong worldbuilding, its execution falls short due to a convoluted structure, inconsistent character motivations, and a lack of historical authenticity.

I hope she continues to write and find joy in her creative path.  \n\n- **Personal Disclaimers and Preferences:**  \n   - I am not the target audience for this novel. This was my first vampire book, and based on this experience, I don’t need to read more in this genre. The themes of drinking blood and violent feeding are disturbing to me.  \n\n- **Themes and Their Execution:**  \n   - The book attempted to tackle many themes, including racism, politics, girl x2 romance, and the Harlem/Gatsby era. While well-intentioned, the combination of these layers felt muddled and lost their impact.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n   - I wasn’t convinced Elise and Layla had genuine chemistry. Their interactions were unpredictable, and I wanted more backstory to show their history. For example, I wanted to see them running around the estate, Elise playing the piano, and Layla dancing to the music. More emotional depth, eye contact, and subtle touches would have helped.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n   - The pacing felt unnatural, with lots of ups and downs that made it hard to follow. The resolution of the mystery came together abruptly, and I’m still unsure what happened in the final 15% of the book.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting Descriptions:**  \n   - The rules of reaperhood weren’t explained clearly or at the right time, making it hard to understand their impact on the characters. The setting descriptions were lacking—I couldn’t picture places, clothes, or appearances. For example, the interrogation scene with Theo’s mother felt underdeveloped. I wanted more details about the house, her appearance, and the questions asked. The only detailed descriptions were the graphic bloodbaths, which I found gross and wanted to skip.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Character Consistency:**  \n   - The dialogue felt unnatural, especially the father’s. While some reviewers interpreted his responses as hints of abusive patterns, to me, they seemed socially inept and disconnected from the conversation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book felt like a whirlwind, and I struggled to piece together what actually happened.

Overall, it was a deeply enjoyable experience.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - The narrator did an excellent job overall, fully committing to the emotional parts, which I loved.  \n  - There was one voice that felt stereotypical and made me cringe, but it was a minor character with only a couple of lines.  \n  - The choice of accents, particularly for characters from the southern US, might be divisive, but I got used to them and they didn’t bother me after a while.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  - Detailed descriptions of death, emotional abuse, an AH father, racism, grief, and unresolved trauma are present, so readers should be aware of these themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this book and am eagerly waiting for the next installment.

However, the development of their relationship post-reunion felt rushed, leaving me wanting more explanation on key aspects.

Unfortunately, character development faltered after her murder of Valeryia, especially since she manipulated Layla without her awareness.",

I’m interested to see where it’s headed.  \n  - It does basically end on a cliffhanger of sorts, so be aware.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - I didn’t see some of the betrayals/villains coming to be honest.  \n  - While we don’t know for sure if Layla takes Elise back after she murdered Valeryia, it made me hate Elise a little bit.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  - I loved the era that the story took place in and the very honest depiction of that time.  \n  - I also liked that the author didn’t shy away from addressing the racial issues.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - It took almost the whole book for the MCs to get together, but I think that is realistic given everything that happened (a complicated past is an understatement).  \n  - However, the level of their relationship after they get together felt a little rushed. I would’ve liked to see more explanation on certain things.  \n  - I found myself finding it hard to like Elise’s character at times because of her privilege and ignorance of her father and his role in things, but I was beginning to like her.  \n  - I felt like the character building was shot down after she murdered Valeryia and basically used Layla to do it without Layla’s knowledge.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  - Throughout the story, something will happen, and then bam, it goes to the next day or something, and you piece together what happened kinda.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Specific Scenes:**  \n  - I’m also just peeved at the whole Valeryia death. Why give such a powerful statement like Layla did, basically telling her mentor, mother-figure, “you may not be here for me, but I’m here for you,” only to kill her in the next chapter?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite some frustrations with pacing, character development, and certain plot decisions. The historical setting, honest depiction of racial issues, and unexpected twists kept me engaged, though the cliffhanger ending and rushed relationship dynamics left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️"

            "The central mystery of why Reapers are becoming human again is compelling and propels the story forward. Although the solution felt somewhat predictable, an unexpected plot twist added an exciting layer to the narrative. The ending leaves readers eager to see where the story will go next. The pacing effectively maintains engagement, particularly during pivotal moments, such as their first kiss and Elisa's decision to share her blood.",
            "Layla, a Reaper orphaned at a young age and sheltered by her best friend's family, the Saints, serves as a captivating protagonist. The narrative gains additional depth from Elisa, the Saint heir returning from Paris, who brings vital insight into the Reapers' motives. The relationship between Layla and Elisa stands out, particularly their enemies-to-lovers dynamic filled with palpable tension.",
            "The tension between Layla and Elisa is masterfully portrayed, making their interactions particularly engaging.",
            "The 1920s setting offers a refreshing and unique backdrop, heightened by the intriguing presence of lesbian vampires, known as Reapers. The worldbuilding is well-crafted, effectively delineating the roles of Reapers and humans and exploring their complex dynamics."

            "Layla is a compelling character—angry, vengeful, and violent, yet relatable in her longing for happiness and normalcy. She truly drives the narrative. However, the chemistry between Layla and Elise feels inconsistent. Their relationship oscillates between tender moments and ongoing conflict, which complicates readers' ability to fully invest in them. More backstory and insight into their past would have deepened their connection.",

            "Set in 1920s Harlem, this novel masterfully weaves themes of sapphic love, black vampires, and a compelling childhood friends-to-enemies-to-lovers dynamic. The intriguing premise follows Layla and Elise, once best friends and now rivals, as they join forces to unravel a mystery that may hold the key to an antidote for vampirism. The portrayal of Harlem is vivid and immersive, capturing the era's essence beautifully."

            "The novel begins with a strong premise but unfortunately declines in quality as it unfolds, particularly in the middle and at the end. Initially, the central mystery is engaging but becomes overshadowed during the drawn-out conflict between Layla and Elise. The conclusion feels rushed and convoluted, relying on abrupt plot twists that lack sufficient buildup and explanation. Additional subplots, such as Layla's attempts to befriend a mean cat, seem superfluous and detract from the main narrative. The novel could benefit from another round of editing to tighten the plot, eliminate unnecessary content, and clarify confusing aspects. Overall, pacing issues in the latter sections diminish the enjoyment of the story.",
            "Elise and Layla are well-developed characters with intricate backstories and dynamics. Elise, a Black heiress in 1920s Harlem, grapples with her privilege and an emotionally abusive father, enriching her character. Layla, burdened by her trauma as a reaper, evokes sympathy and intrigue through her anger. However, the motivation behind Layla's animosity toward Elise's family remains unclear and poorly explained until the end, which makes it feel contrived throughout much of the story.",
            "The 1920s Harlem setting was initially well-established but gradually faded as the story continued. The dialogue lacked authentic period slang, which diminished the sense of time and made the setting feel more modern.",
            "The novel thoughtfully explores serious issues, particularly the treatment of Black individuals in 1920s Harlem and their displacement despite being essential to the community's identity. The incorporation of reaperhood into these themes adds a compelling and thought-provoking layer to the narrative.",
            "The story seems aimed at an adult audience but has been placed in the YA category, resulting in inconsistencies in character ages and relationships. For instance, Elise’s love for Layla since she was thirteen feels more appropriate for older characters."

        "conclusion": "This novel had a strong start with compelling characters, an intriguing premise, and meaningful social commentary. However, it suffered from pacing issues, a convoluted and rushed ending, and a lack of authenticity in its setting. While the potential for a great story is evident, the execution fell short due to insufficient editing and structural flaws. Despite these issues, the novel is still worth recommending for its strong ideas and character dynamics, though it ultimately lost steam and left me less engaged by the end.",

Numerous inconsistencies detract from its authenticity; for instance, alcohol is readily available without any concern for police presence, regardless of whether the characters are gangsters, vampires, or ordinary drinkers.

The concept of vampires (reapers) and the enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Layla and Elise, whose family is dedicated to destroying reapers, was compelling and well-executed.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers relationship between Layla and Elise was depicted effectively, and their dynamic lived up to the trope. Their connection as childhood best friends and lovers added depth to their interactions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt off, with several parts dragging and making the book feel unnecessarily long. A more thorough round of editing could have streamlined the story by cutting out some sections.  \n\n- **Clarity and Writing Style:**  \n  Some scenes were confusing, particularly in keeping track of who was speaking or acting. This occasionally disrupted the flow of the narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The central mystery that Elise and Layla were trying to solve lacked depth and stakes. It didn’t feel as engaging or high-stakes as it could have, which diminished its impact.  \n\n- **Themes and Highlights:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book had many enjoyable scenes and effectively explored themes of friendship and family. These elements added emotional resonance to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an engaging premise and some strong moments, its pacing issues, lack of clarity in certain scenes, and underwhelming mystery made it just an okay read for me. I enjoyed it enough to finish it but don’t feel compelled to continue with the series. Fans of vampires and mystery might still find it enjoyable, especially for its themes and character dynamics.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "This captivating black sapphic enemies-to-lovers tale set during the Harlem Renaissance expertly weaves themes of race, class, and wealth into its narrative, adding depth and relevance. While the historical backdrop is compelling, I wished for a broader exploration of Harlem, moving beyond key locations like The Cotton Club and The Clarice. The final acts are intense and emotionally gripping, leaving me deeply invested in the characters' fates. However, the pacing suffers from abrupt transitions between dialogues and events, which occasionally caused confusion. I also noticed a few typos and editing oversights, although they didn't significantly affect my enjoyment. An expansion of world-building, particularly regarding the Harlem setting and party scenes, would have enhanced the experience even further.",
            "The main characters, Elise and Layla, are compellingly portrayed. Their bond, strained by misunderstandings and external pressures, feels genuine and resilient. Layla shines as the most realistic and emotionally resonant character; her pain, desires, and strength are palpable, making her my favorite. Elise’s journey from privilege to self-awareness is touching, although her initial behavior can be frustrating. Side characters like Thalia and Sterling feel underdeveloped, with Thalia’s death feeling rushed and Sterling’s loyalty to the Saints lacking depth and consistency. While the chemistry, angst, and tension between Elise and Layla are engaging, I wished for more romantic development between them. The romance between the other pair is more fleshed out, though I hope Elise and Layla's relationship receives more attention in future installments. The best-friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope is executed well, showcasing their deep understanding of each other.",
            "The exploration of race, class, and wealth was a standout element, though I would have appreciated a deeper awareness of these dynamics from Tobias. While Layla provided impactful insights into societal inequalities, other characters, such as Sterling, appeared less attuned to these issues."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this YA, historical, sapphic, vampiric romance. The story’s emotional depth, compelling characters, and unique setting kept me engaged, despite some pacing and editing issues. The final acts were particularly gripping, and I’m excited to see how the characters and their relationships evolve in the next installment. For a debut novel, it was impressive, and with a bit more refinement, it could be even better.",

            "**Layla:** I found Layla captivating—she was cool and intriguing. However, I expected her to possess a more malevolent edge given the enemies-to-lovers premise. Instead, her perceived evil stemmed more from her role as a reaper than from her personality. **Elise:** Elise was passable but often felt lackluster. I struggled to connect with her relationship with Layla, although their banter was decent. **Jamie:** Jamie stood out as a fun and well-rounded character, and he was my favorite; I wished he had more screen time. **Mei:** The dynamic between Mei and Layla was more engaging than that between Layla and Elise. Their chemistry and mutual understanding jumped off the page. **Side Characters (Josi, Valeryia, Sterling):** Several side characters were introduced but not fully developed. Valeryia, in particular, could have added depth but barely made an impact. Sterling’s abrupt transition from loyal friend to adversary felt forced and poorly executed.",

I kept waiting to be entertained, but it never happened.\n   - The story felt underdeveloped, with many plot lines and characters introduced but not fully explored.\n   - The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying, as if the story ended in the middle of a scene.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - **Layla:** I liked Layla a lot; she was cool and interesting. However, I expected her to be more evil based on the \"enemies to lovers\" pitch. Instead, she seemed evil only because she was a reaper, not due to her personality.\n   - **Elise:** Elise was okay but often felt dull. I didn’t get invested in her relationship with Layla, though their banter was decent.\n   - **Jamie:** Jamie was a fun and well-balanced character. He was my favorite, and I wish he had more screen time.\n   - **Mei:** I enjoyed the dynamic between Mei and Layla more than Layla and Elise. Their chemistry and mutual understanding were more compelling.\n   - **Side Characters (Josi, Valeryia, Sterling):** Many side characters were introduced but underdeveloped. For example, Valeryia, who could have added depth to the story, was barely present. Sterling’s sudden shift from a loyal friend to an enemy felt forced and poorly written.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**\n   - The book included tropes I usually enjoy, such as \"no one kills her but me\" and the haunting past of Layla and Elise. However, these were executed poorly and didn’t enhance the story.\n   - The focus on the relationship between Layla and Elise overshadowed the plot, making the story feel unbalanced.\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**\n   - The book was pitched as \"enemies to lovers,\" but Layla wasn’t as villainous as I expected. This mismatch between expectation and delivery was disappointing.\n   - I had high hopes for the book based on its premise, but it didn’t live up to the promises.\n\n- **Writing and Execution:**\n   - The writing felt uneven, with some characters and plot lines abruptly dropped or underdeveloped.\n   - The relationship between Layla and Elise was prioritized at the expense of other elements, leading to a lack of depth in the overall story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I didn’t hate the book, I was disappointed because it didn’t meet my expectations. The slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and abrupt ending made it hard to fully enjoy. If you go into this book without high expectations, you might find it enjoyable, but it wasn’t for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

I appreciated the frequent deaths of characters I had come to like, as they heightened the tension. However, the final 20% of the book became overly convoluted and confusing. The pacing felt rushed, with an overload of confrontations and unresolved plot threads. Key moments, particularly Valeriya’s accusations and Elise’s inconsistent actions, left me questioning what I had missed. The ending was especially challenging to follow, as characters made questionable decisions and the narrative failed to resolve loose ends coherently.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the main characters, Layla and Elise, and their slow-burn romance, transitioning from friends to enemies to lovers. Their relationship was marked by genuine pain, yearning, and complex emotions, which was the highlight of the book for me. The tension stemming from their fractured friendship and opposing sides in the reaper-hunter war, coupled with years of suppressed feelings, was skillfully portrayed. \n\nHowever, the secondary characters fell flat. Apart from Layla and Elise, most were either unlikable or lacked depth. Even those who weren't entirely unappealing often met grim fates, leaving little room for escape or redemption. Elise’s decision to inject Sterling with venom, triggering a murderous rampage, was particularly disturbing. This act felt malicious yet went unexamined by the other characters, which left me feeling conflicted.\n\nThe sapphic yearning between Layla and Elise was a standout aspect of the story. I appreciated the refreshing slow-burn approach, especially in a genre where enemies-to-lovers tropes often resolve too quickly. However, while the romance was compelling, I wished for more development in that aspect; it felt a bit underdeveloped despite its engaging potential.",

The blend of sapphic romance within this backdrop is a standout element, and I find myself yearning for more stories like this. While the themes of corruption, moral ambiguity, and the blurred lines between good and evil are present, they aren’t fully explored. The story misses an opportunity to delve into Elise’s morally questionable actions, leaving these themes feeling underdeveloped."

However, the stakes of their relationship felt flimsy because their shared history was never fully explained.  \n   - Layla and Mei's sudden revelation of an intimate relationship felt inconsistent, as Layla had been dismissive of Mei earlier in the book.  \n   - Elise's relationship with her father was one-sided, reducing the emotional impact of her struggle to earn his respect.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot often forced characters into actions that contradicted their earlier behaviors or thought processes, making the story feel disjointed.  \n   - Key moments, such as Elise stabbing her friend, felt abrupt and lacked proper buildup or justification.  \n   - The original reaper lady's actions, like kidnapping Elise's sister and working with her father, were confusing and inconsistent with her stated hatred of humans.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The novel explored interesting themes, such as eugenics and human experimentation, but these ideas were overshadowed by weak characterization and plot-driven inconsistencies.  \n   - The author's concepts were strong, but the execution lacked depth, particularly in character-driven storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a fascinating premise and explored compelling themes, it ultimately fell short due to inconsistent character motivations, underdeveloped relationships, and a plot that often contradicted character logic. The story had potential, but it needed more focus on characterization and a cohesive narrative to fully deliver on its intriguing ideas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "As the story unfolds, the mystery of the murders and the developing relationship between Elise and Layla become increasingly captivating. The inventive storytelling, combined with gothic horror and noir elements, makes this book an ideal choice for the fall season.",
            "The relationship between Elise and Layla is at the heart of the story, following a friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trajectory. Their interactions brim with homoerotic tension and a magical twist, although the initial banter can feel inconsistent—oscillating between overly aggressive and not aggressive enough. The early lack of clear stakes in their conflict renders their dynamic somewhat uneven, but it strengthens as the mystery unfolds. Elise, a naive yet well-intentioned character, embodies both privilege and struggle, making her growth relatable and endearing despite her flaws. In contrast, Layla is more complex, grappling with her identity as a reaper, battling self-loathing and defensiveness. This internal conflict makes her character harder to pin down but ultimately more compelling.",
            "This novel is a captivating historical fantasy set in 1920s Harlem, where reapers (vampires) and vampire hunters coexist. The story centers on the romantic connection between Elise Saint, the heiress of a vampire hunting dynasty, and Layla Quinn, a reaper and Elise’s childhood friend, who becomes embroiled in a gruesome murder investigation.",
            "The novel delves into themes of privilege, humanity, and prejudice, particularly through the lens of reapers and their violent transformations. Layla's internal struggle and the biased portrayal of reaperhood enrich the narrative, emphasizing the tension between monstrosity and sympathy."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *This Ravenous Fate* is a compelling historical fantasy with a strong focus on character dynamics, social commentary, and mystery. While the initial character interactions felt uneven, the story gains momentum and depth as it progresses. The audiobook narration significantly enhances the experience, making it an enjoyable and atmospheric read, especially for fans of gothic horror and noir mystery.",

            "The story follows Elise and Layla as they reluctantly join forces to investigate the murder of Thalia, despite their strained friendship. It thoughtfully explores themes of family drama, forbidden romance, and societal tensions, including racism and segregation. The inclusion of reapers as both antagonists and sympathetic figures adds significant complexity to the narrative.",
            "In this engaging story, 18-year-old Elise Saint returns home after five years in Paris, where her father pressures her to hunt down reapers, specifically targeting her former friend, Layla Quinn. Layla, also 18, was transformed into a reaper at 13 and holds Elise responsible for her tragic fate. Framed for multiple murders, Layla's character is shrouded in tension. My favorite character, Valeryia—Layla's mentor and clan leader—exudes quiet power and has a compelling backstory that sheds light on her animosity toward the Saints. The dual perspectives of Elise and Layla, combined with their forced proximity and an enemies-to-lovers dynamic, significantly enrich the narrative. The supporting cast, including Tobias, Analia, Sterling, Thalia, and Theo, are well-developed and add depth to the plot.",
            "The nostalgic depiction of Harlem's jazz scene, featuring iconic venues like the Cotton Club and The Savoy, was captivating. The historical context, including references to the Tulsa massacre, added significant depth to the narrative. Set in 1926, the combination of reaper/human agreements and societal tensions crafted a rich and immersive atmosphere.",
            "The story's emotional depth garnered a 4/5, featuring moments of tension, heartbreak, and reconciliation. The romance between Layla and Elise was engaging, also rated 4/5 for their dynamic. The spice level was low (1/5), limited to a kiss and a nibble, which suited the YA tone of the novel."

        "conclusion": "This debut novel by the author is a captivating blend of YA, horror, historical fiction, and fantasy. The immersive setting, well-developed characters, and emotional depth make it a standout read.

The tension and banter between Layla and Elise were enjoyable, though I would have appreciated more flashbacks showcasing their friendship before Elise became a reaper. While the enemies-to-lovers theme was well-executed, I wished for a deeper exploration of both phases. The side characters felt underdeveloped, diminishing the impact of their actions. Additionally, Layla's motivation for taking the antidote was confusing and inconsistent with her character, particularly given her strong commentary on white privilege and the experimentation on Black bodies. Her decision to trust a white man seemed out of place, although one could argue that her desperation for a normal human life clouded her judgment.",

            "The premise of sapphic vampires in 1920s Harlem, featuring a vampire compelled to collaborate with her human adversary, is both intriguing and enjoyable. While the storyline is somewhat predictable, it remains a satisfying read. The pacing, however, is uneven; the narrative tends to drag in the middle, with most of the action and crucial details concentrated in the final quarter.",
            "**Elise:** A largely unlikable character, Elise's only redeeming quality is her genuine care for her younger sister, Josi. Her cringe-worthy need for her father's approval reveals a selfish and privileged nature, making her a tiring presence throughout the story. **Layla:** In contrast, Layla is a strong and likable character. Despite her hardships, she remains compassionate and prioritizes the clan's well-being, handling pressure far better than Elise. **Jamie:** A standout character, Jamie is portrayed with humor and evokes a vivid image reminiscent of a 1920s version of J-Roc from *Trailer Park Boys*.",
            "The author demonstrates promise, and the ending opens the door to future possibilities. However, certain sections of the story could benefit from trimming to allow for more detailed and engaging content.",
            "The book falls short in providing adequate detail regarding the reapers' transformation after the injection and Thalia's mother's research. Additionally, the backstory of Layla and her parents becoming vampires is underdeveloped; a dedicated chapter would have added much-needed depth. Furthermore, the tension between Elise and Layla feels unconvincing, as it hinges solely on Elise informing her father about Layla's parents' alliance with the reapers."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book was an enjoyable read with an intriguing premise and likable characters like Layla and Jamie. However, it suffered from uneven pacing, underdeveloped backstories, and a somewhat predictable plot. Despite these flaws, the story ended on a strong note, leaving room for future possibilities.

Most of the action and missing information was concentrated in the last quarter of the book.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - **Elise:** Not a likable character. Her only redeeming quality was her genuine care for her younger sister, Josi. Her relationship with her father and constant need for his approval was cringe-worthy. She came across as selfish, privileged, and exhausting.  \n   - **Layla:** A likable and strong character. Despite her hardships, she remained compassionate and focused on what was best for the clan. She handled pressure better than Elise.  \n   - **Jamie:** A standout character, described in a way that evoked humor and a specific visual (a 1920s version of J-Roc from *Trailer Park Boys*).  \n\n- **World-Building and Detail:**  \n   - The book lacked sufficient detail about the reapers' transformation after the injection and Thalia's mother's research.  \n   - The backstory of Layla and her parents being turned into vampires was underdeveloped. A chapter dedicated to this would have added depth.  \n   - The reason for Elise and Layla's enmity felt underwhelming, as it was based solely on Elise informing her father about Layla's parents' alliance plans with the reapers.  \n\n- **Writing and Potential:**  \n   - The author, Hayley, shows potential, and the book ended in a way that sets up a sequel.  \n   - Some parts of the story could have been trimmed to make room for more detailed and engaging content.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was an enjoyable read with an intriguing premise and likable characters like Layla and Jamie. However, it suffered from uneven pacing, underdeveloped backstories, and a somewhat predictable plot. Despite these flaws, the story ended on a strong note, leaving room for a sequel. The author has potential, and I look forward to seeing what she writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars)"

While the setup between Layla and Elise includes great tropes, the execution falls short. Their relationship development feels unnatural and abrupt, lacking the chemistry I hoped for. Although predictability can be acceptable, the narrative needed a stronger delivery to make up for it.",

            "The villains are depicted in a cartoonish manner, with exaggerated supervillain dialogue and over-the-top \"evil plan outlining\" that detracts from their seriousness. Additionally, Elise’s father is written as a one-dimensional caricature of an abusive figure, his bombastic antics rendering him less believable and impactful.",
            "The pacing of the story is chaotic, and the dialogue often feels cringeworthy. The writing comes across as melodramatic and amateurish, with overly simplistic phrasing and setups that suggest the book is aimed at a younger audience, despite its mature themes and graphic vampire content. Additionally, the action scenes lack compelling energy.",
            "This novel presents a queer vampire story set against the backdrop of the Harlem Renaissance, showcasing a predominantly Black cast that mirrors the era's multiracial society. Central to the narrative is the theme of systemic racism, which permeates daily life—from street encounters to healthcare disparities and the exploitation of Black bodies in science. Drawing on historical records, the book highlights some of the most egregious examples of hatred in American history. I appreciate the inclusion of diverse characters and perspectives, as well as the exploration of themes that have long needed attention."

This compelling arc left me craving more of this trope! Their shared history added depth to their current relationship and made the resurgence of their old feelings engaging. However, I found Elise frustrating throughout much of the book. While the narrative presented her and Layla's animosity as mutual, I felt Layla's feelings were justified, whereas Elise’s motivations seemed unfounded. Elise's actions, especially killing Layla’s surrogate mother after their reconciliation, undermined the dynamic the story had established and left me feeling disappointed.",

            "This book would greatly benefit from another round of editing to clarify its mystery and tighten the plot. A few additional chapters could help resolve unanswered questions and add depth to certain elements of the story. Set in Harlem during the Prohibition era, it follows Elise Saint, a Reaper hunter heiress, and her reluctant ally, Layla, as they investigate a surge in reaper attacks and work to clear Layla's name. The slow-burn romance between the characters was enjoyable, and I hope the author continues this approach in the next installment. However, the mystery felt somewhat convoluted, leaving some questions unresolved by the end. Additionally, Tobias Saint, Elise’s father, was challenging to understand, as his motivations and ultimate goals remained unclear.",

This progression is skillfully portrayed, with every scene featuring the two of them being dynamic, engaging, and enjoyable. Both characters are well-developed, possessing unique personalities and motivations that extend beyond their connection. Elise’s quest for her father’s approval and her journey toward freedom from familial expectations are compellingly crafted. Meanwhile, Layla’s pain, anger, and longing for Elise make her a deeply sympathetic figure. The dual perspectives of Elise and Layla are seamlessly presented, with distinct voices and narratives that are easy to follow.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n   - The premise of sapphic Black vampires in the USA during the 1920s was incredibly fun and unique.  \n   - The book effectively explores themes of race, gender, wealth, and class, handling each one fantastically.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story is set in Harlem, New York, during the prohibition era.  \n   - It follows Elise Saint, a Reaper hunter heiress, and her reluctant reaper ally, Layla, as they investigate the rise in reaper attacks and clear Layla’s name.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Elise and Layla’s relationship evolves from friends to enemies to reluctant allies to lovers, and this progression was handled very well.  \n   - Each scene featuring Elise and Layla together was dynamic, interesting, and fun.  \n   - Both characters are well-rounded, with distinct personalities and motivations that extend beyond their relationship.  \n   - Elise’s struggle for her father’s approval and her eventual freedom from her family’s expectations were compelling and well-paced.  \n   - Layla’s pain, anger, and longing for Elise made her a deeply sympathetic character.  \n   - The dual perspectives of Elise and Layla were seamless, with distinct voices and stories that were easy to follow.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n   - The slow-burn romance was enjoyable, and I hope the author continues this approach in the next book.  \n   - The mystery and investigation felt slightly convoluted, and some questions remained unanswered by the end of the book.  \n   - Tobias Saint, Elise’s father, was difficult to understand, as his motivations and end goals were unclear.  \n\n- **Editing and Structure:**  \n   - The book could benefit from another round of editing to clarify the mystery and tighten the plot.  \n   - A few extra chapters might have helped resolve some of the unanswered questions and provide more depth to certain aspects of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its unique premise, strong themes, and well-developed characters. While the mystery and some character motivations could have been clearer, the dynamic relationship between Elise and Layla and the exploration of their individual struggles made the story engaging.

The narrative delves into secrets surrounding the reapers, the Saints, and the city’s complex power dynamics. However, the story feels overly long, with a slow burn that failed to captivate my interest. The pacing lingered too much, lacking sufficient action or paranormal elements to keep me engaged.",
            "Elise and Layla are central characters, but their development feels inadequate. I didn't sense the chemistry between them, particularly during the transition from friendship to romance. It would have been more satisfying to see their friendship repaired before delving into romance. While the morally grey characters and their dynamics had potential, they were not thoroughly explored. Overall, the romance between Layla and Elise felt rushed, lacking the depth needed to make it believable.

The transition from friendship to enemies to lovers was not adequately developed, making it difficult to grasp why the characters felt such strong emotions for one another. I typically enjoy the enemies-to-lovers trope, but here it fell short. There was no exploration of misunderstandings or the journey of recognizing the worst in someone and still coming to love them.

Their actions often didn’t align with their established personalities, leaving me confused about their motivations.  \n   - The romance, billed as a key element, lacked depth. The transition from friendship to enemies to lovers was poorly developed, making it hard to understand why the characters felt strongly about each other.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The enemies-to-lovers trope, which I usually enjoy, fell short here. There was no exploration of misunderstandings, misrepresentations, or the process of seeing the worst in someone and still coming to love them.  \n   - The lack of setup for why the characters liked or hated each other made their relationship feel unconvincing and forced.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - I appreciated the book’s focus on Black lesbians and its social commentary on segregation, aligning real-world struggles with the fictional vampiric narrative. This was a standout aspect of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a promising concept and meaningful representation, it ultimately fell short for me due to weak character development, lackluster pacing, and an underdeveloped romance. The setting didn’t live up to its potential, and the plot became less engaging as it progressed. Despite its strengths in representation and themes, the execution left me frustrated and disconnected from the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating was provided, but the overall sentiment suggests a lower rating due to the issues highlighted."

            "The story's execution left much to be desired. The murder mystery felt lacking in urgency, and the pacing occasionally dragged. I found myself more drawn to Elise and Layla's relationship and backstory, yet I wished for a deeper exploration of their early friendship.",
            "The romance between Elise and Layla is thoughtfully crafted, transitioning from childhood friends to enemies, allies, friends, and ultimately lovers. Their relationship is rich with angst, tension, and anger, reflecting the complexities of their shared history. Notably, the representation of Black queer relationships stands out. However, the side characters fall flat, leaving little emotional investment in anyone beyond Elise, Layla, Elise’s family (to a limited extent), and the leader of the reapers, whose depth only emerges late in the story.",

While Elise's perspective didn't resonate as strongly with me, I still appreciated her character.

The concept of Black lesbian vampires in 1920s Harlem is exceptionally compelling, pulling me in right from the start. The historical setting of Harlem in 1926, paired with supernatural elements, provides a unique and captivating backdrop for the narrative."

However, the remainder of the book resembles a rough draft, plagued by plot holes and logical inconsistencies that feel like placeholders for further development.

Some conflicts involve characters, like Valeriya and Layla, who are not adequately developed or introduced in relation to the story's main themes.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The first 100-150 pages are excellent, with a strong introduction, rich descriptions, and intriguing historical details. This section feels like a 5-star read.\n   - The rest of the book feels like a rough draft, with plot holes and jumps in logic that seem like placeholders for more development.\n\n- **World-Building and Immersion:**\n   - The initial chapters provide beautiful, immersive descriptions of the scenery, but this level of detail is lacking in the latter parts of the book.\n   - The timeline and context surrounding key events (e.g., the older sister's death and Elise's attack) are underdeveloped, leaving the reader wanting more detail.\n\n- **Character Development and Representation:**\n   - Elise's OCD is introduced abruptly in a bathroom scene, with little to no prior indication of her struggles. More subtle hints or indicators of her condition earlier in the story would have been appreciated.\n   - Arguments between characters feel poorly framed and unresolved, often starting abruptly and shifting topics without resolution. Some arguments involve characters who haven’t been sufficiently developed or introduced in the context of the conflict (e.g., Valeriya and Layla).\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Partitions:**\n   - The use of \"Part 1,\" \"Part 2,\" etc., feels unnecessary, as there is no clear change in narrator, POV, or setting to justify the divisions. The story simply continues without any noticeable shift.\n   - The \"Part Titles\" are confusing and don’t seem to add meaning or clarity to the narrative.\n\n- **Aesthetic Elements:**\n   - The page dividers are beautifully designed, adding a visually appealing element to the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel starts strong with a captivating introduction and rich historical details, but it loses momentum in the latter half, feeling underdeveloped and disjointed. While the representation of OCD and character dynamics could have been handled more effectively, the book does have some visually appealing design elements. Overall, it’s a mixed experience with moments of brilliance overshadowed by structural and narrative flaws.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Current rating: 3.5/5."

            "The story centers on Elise Saint, the unwilling heir to the Saint family, and Layla Quinn, a reaper betrayed by Elise. Together, they must investigate a series of brutal killings linked to rumors of a reaper cure. The plot is rich with conspiracies and secrets from Elise's father, his associates, and older reapers, creating a tense and dangerous atmosphere. The stakes are high, as the fragile alliance between humans and reapers hangs in the balance, threatening the lives of reapers at the hands of the Saints. The developing love between Elise and Layla is poignant, yet it cannot shield them from the harsh realities of their world; their relationship serves as an emotional undercurrent rather than the main focus amidst the unfolding conflicts. The narrative unfolds at a brisk pace, with multiple plots interweaving, and Elise's limited understanding of these schemes heightens the suspense. Although some questions remain unanswered, they are likely to be explored in the next installment.",
            "Elise is a compelling protagonist haunted by past traumas and driven to shield her younger sister from the burdens of the Saint empire. Her anxiety is intensified by her rigid father, who values results and the empire’s legacy over her well-being. Meanwhile, Layla grapples with her identity as a reaper and the betrayal she has faced. The shift in their relationship—from former friends to hesitant allies—adds significant emotional depth to the story.",
            "Set in an alternate 1926 New York, this novel introduces a world where vampires, referred to as reapers, pose a continuous threat. The richly detailed setting reveals the vulnerability of reapers to specific types of steel and highlights the daily struggles faced by both police and hunters. Societal dynamics, including prevalent prejudices against Black individuals, the poor, and dissenters of the reaper cure, add significant depth to the narrative. The influence of the Saint family, with their empire of bullets and reaper research, further enhances the story's complexity.",
            "This novel adeptly examines themes of prejudice, racism, and power dynamics, particularly as they affect marginalized groups. It also engages with the moral complexities surrounding the eradication of reapers versus the pursuit of a cure, showcasing the ethical dilemmas faced by the characters."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*This Ravenous Fate* is a gripping and atmospheric novel that combines rich world-building, complex characters, and layered conflicts. The story is both bloody and emotionally charged, with themes of prejudice and power adding depth. While the romantic subplot is compelling, it doesn't overshadow the high-stakes plot. The novel sets the stage for an intense conclusion in the next half of the duology.",

The societal dynamics, including prejudices and racism against Black people, the poor, and those opposing the reaper cure, add depth to the setting.

I also hope the paperback edition features a cover that better reflects the story and its characters.",
            "The dialogue felt overly formal, with instances like \"I will\" instead of \"I'll\" and \"does not\" rather than \"doesn't.\" This choice made the speech sound unnatural, even for a 1926 setting. The absence of conjunctions contributed to a stiff and unrealistic tone.",
            "The story includes some anachronisms, such as the casual mention of terms like osmosis, IQ tests, and commercial flights, which feel out of place for 1926. Although these concepts existed at the time, they weren't colloquial in the way presented. Additionally, the worldbuilding is somewhat lacking, particularly with the absence of homophobia; while it's refreshing to see a lack of prejudice, the absence of more gay characters feels unrealistic. Nevertheless, the engaging narrative and compelling characters make it possible to overlook these inconsistencies."

The first quarter of the book simply rehashed what was already stated in the synopsis, while the following sections dragged on with repetitive and uneventful exchanges between the main characters, Elise and Layla, as they pursued the murderer. Unfortunately, these scenes felt dull and unengaging.",

Insufficient flashbacks fail to establish their past friendship or the reasons behind their conflict, leaving their dynamic feeling strained and their romantic evolution perplexing. Additionally, Elise, one of the protagonists, comes across as unlikable. While some readers appreciate unlikable narrators, Elise was not presented as such in the marketing, resulting in a disappointing characterization.",
            "The worldbuilding in the story was weak and underdeveloped. Although it is set in 1920s New York, the setting lacked vivid descriptions and integration into the narrative. Despite occasional references to the Prohibition era, the world felt unconvincing, and the characters often seemed more suited to 2024 than to the 1920s.",

These elements drew me to the book initially.  \n   - The politics, mythology, lore, and the influence of science were well-executed and added depth to the story.  \n   - The Saint family and their complex dynamics were intriguing and well-developed.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n   - Layla and Elise are portrayed as young and emotionally volatile, which felt authentic. Their emotions shift dramatically, reflecting their youth and the external pressures they face.  \n   - Their love is fickle due to their opposing sides in the conflict and external forces driving them apart, which added tension to their relationship.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing was uneven, which affected the romance, mystery, and emotional scenes. Some parts felt slow, while others had abrupt scene changes that made it hard to process events.  \n   - Point-of-view changes within chapters were occasionally confusing and disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - While I enjoyed the book and found it entertaining, I didn’t fully fall in love with it due to the pacing issues.  \n   - Despite its flaws, I’m interested in reading the sequel and will keep an eye on its release date.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had many elements I loved, such as its themes, mythology, and complex family dynamics, but the uneven pacing and abrupt scene changes hindered my full immersion. While I didn’t fall in love with it, I found it entertaining enough to look forward to the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While the premise was intriguing, the execution left much to be desired. The story failed to delve deeply into relationships and character motivations, ultimately diminishing my investment in the narrative.",
            "Layla's character offered some intrigue, particularly through her relationships within the reaper clan, but she ultimately failed to fully engage me. Elise, on the other hand, was dull, and her actions often came across as confusing or unconvincing. The bond between Layla and Elise felt underdeveloped, lacking sufficient depth to support their supposed closeness prior to the accident. While secondary characters like Jamie and his cat were enjoyable, Jamie’s depiction as a ruthless gangster conflicted with his actions throughout the story. Elisa's father resembled a one-dimensional villain, making her rebellion against him feel delayed and unsatisfying. Valerya had little presence, rendering the ending inconsequential. Although Sterling started off as an interesting character, he suddenly turned against Elise, creating an abrupt and underdeveloped shift in the narrative.",
            "The story, set in the 1920s, falls short in creating a vivid atmosphere. The lack of descriptive details means it could easily take place in any era, as the setting fails to significantly contribute to the plot or tone.",

            "The romance, a central aspect of the story, was well-developed. Although I didn't fully grasp the characters' specific grievances, their gradual resolution felt authentic. The reaper venom subplot did raise concerns about Elise’s ability to consent, which slightly undermined the abrupt shift in their relationship. Nevertheless, this complexity aligned with the story's overall tone.",
            "The conflict between Elise, her father, and Layla became repetitive by the midpoint, as the same dynamics were revisited without much growth. I found it difficult to grasp why Elise's father was so protective of his family and legacy yet held such animosity towards her. Additionally, Layla’s reasoning for blaming Elise for her family's death was unclear, and her acceptance of the reapers as her new family, despite their role in the tragedy, felt inadequately explored. Sterling's character arc was particularly confusing, with his sudden and complete transformation occurring around 70% into the story, which came across as unsatisfying and poorly justified.",
            "The writing is heavily focused on atmosphere, emphasizing character emotions, backstories, parties, outfits, sex scenes, and murders. As a result, the plot can be condensed into a short list, as the narrative prioritizes mood over complex storytelling.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the historical setting and the unique take on vampirism—termed \"reapers\" in this book. It evoked memories of *Dread Nation*, but with a lighter tone. The portrayal of 1920s gangsters and the vibrant atmosphere of NYC were exceptionally well-crafted and immersive."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed the historical setting, the concept of reapers, and the immersive 1920s vibes. However, the repetitive character conflicts, underdeveloped motivations, and confusing character arcs (particularly Sterling’s) detracted from the experience. The romance was a highlight, though the consent issues surrounding reaper venom added complexity. This book is best suited for readers who appreciate atmospheric storytelling and messy, dramatic relationships.",

However, this messiness fit the overall tone of the story.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I would recommend this book for fans of *A Tempest of Tea*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the historical setting, the concept of reapers, and the immersive 1920s vibes.

            "In this tale set in 1920s Harlem, Elise, the heir to the Saint Empire, joins forces with her childhood friend, now a reaper, to unravel a series of mysterious murders targeting reapers and others. However, the story's pacing is sluggish, and the urgency to solve the mystery is lacking. The stakes, including the disappearance of reapers, fail to create a compelling motivation. Additionally, the plot feels predictable, with the antagonists’ identities becoming apparent early on.",
            "The 1920s Harlem setting, complete with speak-easies and gangsters, comes across as unnatural and anachronistic. It lacks authenticity, feeling as though modern elements could intrude at any moment.",

The novel skillfully weaves together themes of generational family drama, racial tensions, and the atmosphere of prohibition-era Harlem. Central to the narrative is a slow-burn romance between two girls who have loved each other for years but have yet to confess their feelings.",

While the political workings of the world aren’t deeply explored, it doesn’t detract from the narrative, as the story is told from the perspectives of Layla and Elise.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Layla and Elise are broken, flawed, and incredibly lovable. Their evolving relationship is the heart of the book and the best part of the story. Elise’s father is another standout character, with his mysterious connections to powerful figures adding intrigue. Layla’s involvement with her vampire clan and gangsters in the speakeasy world adds another layer of complexity to her character.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery surrounding the deaths of reapers as humans drives the plot forward, forcing Layla and Elise to work together despite their complicated past.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n   - The story is a sapphic tale featuring a vampire and a vampire hunter who were once childhood best friends, then enemies, and now reluctant allies (possibly lovers).  \n   - The concept is ambitiously brilliant, set in 1920s Harlem, with a war between vampires and humans, where the Saints' empire seeks to exterminate reapers to restore peace.  \n   - The idea of former best friends seeking a cure to end vampires' existence is intriguing.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n   - The setting in 1920s Harlem is interesting, but the world-building feels incomplete.  \n   - There is potential for more depth in the next book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**  \n   - The pacing is average.  \n   - The plot has excellent ideas, but not all are executed properly, including some plot twists.  \n   - The ending is a good cliffhanger, though there is a sense of indecision in how it was handled.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The author effectively weaves in themes of racism, privilege, class, and wealth, reflecting the time period.  \n   - The main characters' handling of these issues adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The chemistry between Layla and Elise is intense, with palpable yearning, angst, and emotional depth.  \n   - However, their past together feels underexplored, leaving their relationship lacking in depth.  \n   - Layla and Elise are well-liked, but other characters (except Jamie and Josie) are less compelling.  \n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n   - The book has the potential to be a good start to a series.  \n   - Despite some flaws, it is a strong debut, and the sequel is highly anticipated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sapphic vampire-hunter story set in 1920s Harlem has an ambitious and intriguing premise, with strong themes and intense character chemistry. While the world-building and plot execution could be improved, the book shows promise as a debut and leaves readers eager for the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot feels nearly absent, reduced to a buddy cop murder mystery featuring only one true suspect: Stephen Wayne. Surprise, it's Stephen Wayne! The conclusion is a chaotic jumble that unravels upon even a moment's consideration of the characters' locations and the events that should be taking place.",
            "I found it challenging to connect with many of the characters or their relationships. Elise comes across as a stuck-up, melodramatic brat with no real problems. Layla, Sterling, and Mei deserve a far better plot than they were given. The inclusion of Jamie, a white gangster, felt unnecessary and confusing. Elise's father is depicted as a cliched caricature of emotional abuse, while her mother is practically absent. The romance was trite and forced, lacking any genuine chemistry. I would much prefer to see Layla and Mei in a romantic storyline rather than endure another 10,000 words of Elise and Layla's toxic dynamic flipping from hatred to reluctant attraction.",
            "The writing style is overly direct and lacks nuance, opting to tell rather than show, resulting in a lack of intrigue. While the book presents an interesting premise and several thought-provoking ideas, they ultimately feel superficial and unfulfilled.",
            "The story's intriguing worldbuilding ultimately misses the mark due to a lack of clear direction and purpose. The idea of reaper venom being sold as a drug is a fascinating concept that could have opened up exciting plot possibilities. However, it is overshadowed by a muddled murder mystery and an poorly executed romance that detracts from the overall narrative."

        "conclusion": "This Ravenous Fate delivers on its promised enemies-to-lovers sapphic vampire premise in the most technical sense, but it was a painful read due to poorly developed characters, a lackluster plot, and a writing style that lacks nuance.

Elise was a stuck-up, melodramatic brat with no real problems. Layla, Sterling, and Mei are characters deserving of a better plot. I don't know why this white gangster Jamie is so relevant, but he is. Her father is a wack caricature of emotional abuse, and her mother is nonexistent. The romance was so trite and forced that it had no real chemistry. I'd rather see Layla and Mei together romantically than read another 10k words of Elise or Layla's seething-hatred-turned-reluctant-lust towards each other.\n\n- **Worldbuilding and Plot Execution:**\n  - Potentially interesting worldbuilding falls flat due to a lack of direction and intention. Reaper venom being sold intentionally as a drug is a genuinely insane concept (in a good way) that could have led to cool plot threads, but that, along with the rest of the lackluster murder mystery(?) plot, is stretched thin by the back-and-forth between this awfully written romance.\n  - The plot is basically nonexistent. It's a buddy cop murder mystery with only ONE actual suspect, and that's Stephen Wayne. Guess who it was? STEPHEN WAYNE. The ending was an all-over-the-place mess that falls apart if you take 5 seconds to think about where characters are in a room and what should be happening.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n  - The writing style is so direct, on the nose, and tell-instead-of-show that there's no nuance or intrigue in anything. The book had an interesting premise and some interesting ideas, but that's all it is: concepts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis Ravenous Fate delivers on its promised enemies-to-lovers sapphic vampire premise in the most technical sense, but it was a painful read due to poorly developed characters, a lackluster plot, and a writing style that lacks nuance. While there are some interesting ideas, they are not executed well. An additional star is given for effort and attempt, which I appreciate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5 stars, rounded down."

            "The story follows childhood friends Elise and Layla, whose paths diverge in the face of the Harlem reaper, a vampire menace. While the premise is captivating, particularly for vampire enthusiasts, the execution falls short. The central mystery is predictable, with the resolution becoming evident as soon as the first murder takes place.",
            "Initially, I thought I would dislike Layla and side with Elise, but my views changed as the story unfolded. Elise's elitist attitude and lack of self-awareness made her increasingly unlikable, diminishing any sympathy I felt for her, even as her father's cruelty was revealed. In contrast, Layla evoked genuine empathy, particularly after her transformation into a reaper and the loss of her family. The romantic chemistry between Elise and Layla felt forced and unconvincing, as both characters exhibited greater tension and compatibility with the side characters.",

            "Each character is richly developed with a complex backstory, making their motives, beliefs, and morals easy to understand. Even the monster characters exhibit human qualities. However, there was a moment in the middle of the story when I struggled to feel the chemistry between the protagonists, despite my efforts to notice it. While it wasn't a slow-burn issue, I felt the romance could have blossomed earlier. Fortunately, the author ultimately crafted the slow burn beautifully.",
            "I started the book with no prior knowledge and, after a few chapters, felt compelled to explore its premise. It seemed like fate that I picked this title—vampires, sapphic romance, and protagonists who despise each other? It was precisely my kind of story."

It was exactly my cup of tea.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook was executed brilliantly. Tamika, the narrator, did an incredible job with her voice, conveying emotions vividly. I hope to hear more of her work in the future.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n   - Once I understood the story, I found the plot quite interesting. The book grabs you from the beginning, both with its story and its characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n   - Each character has a complex backstory, and their motives, beliefs, and morals were portrayed in an understandable way. Even the \"monster\" characters had a human aspect to them.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry and Pacing:**  \n   - There was a moment in the middle of the story where I didn’t feel the chemistry between the protagonists, no matter how much I looked for it. It wasn’t a slow burn issue—that was clear—but I felt the romance could have developed sooner. Fortunately, the author managed to build the slow burn fantastically afterward.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure (Critique):**  \n   - In the last chapters, I found myself absolutely lost. I feel the conflicts could have been summarized in fewer chapters to avoid making the book feel longer than necessary. This is a personal opinion, though.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn short, this is a fantastic book that I highly recommend.

However, I really didn't see any of that, which was the most disappointing part. I like my enemies-to-lovers stories to have great banter and loads of angst, but there was just none of that here. While it didn't affect the chemistry between the two, I still felt like it was missing.\n\n- **Plot and Genre:**\n   - I did not expect the book to be a murder mystery kind of story. The whole time, they were trying to figure out why vampires were turning human and dying. I thought the concept of vampires turning human was interesting, especially since the book portrayed most vampires as humans who were infected and didn't want to be what they are. I sympathized with their desire to return to their former lives.\n\n- **Pacing:**\n   - The pacing was off. It really dragged in some parts, and I found myself bored and zoning out while listening to the audiobook. When I refocused, I realized I hadn't missed much, which happened quite often. I don't know exactly what made me lose focus, but I found those parts boring overall, and this was the second biggest disappointment.\n\n- **Potential vs. Execution:**\n   - The concept of a sapphic vampire and vampire hunter had so much potential, but the book fell flat for me.

It felt so fresh and glittery that it could have been my first vampire book, which was incredibly refreshing.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The story started a bit slow, but it picked up significantly once the girls began working together. I think it might have been more engaging if they had been forced together sooner.\n   - The ending felt rushed, which diminished the impact of the plot twist and the ensuing arguments/tension. I didn’t fully grasp the emotional weight of the conclusion.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance was a standout element, with its sapphic enemies-to-lovers dynamic and the added angst that made it all the more intriguing. It’s swoon-worthy and beautifully executed.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Both characters undergo significant self-growth, and the story includes meaningful commentary on worthiness and self-love. Their journeys were compelling and added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Originality:**\n   - The book takes a familiar (and sometimes overdone) vampire trope and transforms it into something entirely new and captivating. The infusion of Black girl magic and unique twists made it feel like a fresh take on the genre.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - Despite some pacing issues, this was a wonderful debut novel with a lot to love. I’m excited to see where the story goes next!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a refreshing and unique take on the vampire genre, with stunning world-building, a swoon-worthy romance, and compelling character growth. While the pacing had some issues, particularly with the rushed ending, it’s a strong debut that leaves me eager for more.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The novel is set in the vibrant 1920s Harlem, which adds a fun and immersive jazz-age atmosphere to the story.  \n   - The urban fantasy world, with its reapers (vampires) and the societal issues of racism and black history, creates a unique and engaging backdrop.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Layla, a young reaper and former best friend of Elise, is a complex and compelling character. I found myself rooting for her throughout the book due to her built-up anger and frequent misunderstandings.  \n   - Elise Saint, the good-girl protagonist from a wealthy family, contrasts well with Layla, and their intense feud adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot revolves around Elise and Layla teaming up to solve gruesome murders, which keeps the story intriguing.  \n   - However, the pacing feels uneven at times. Some sections are gripping, while others, particularly the repetitive conversations between Elise and her father, drag the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Dennings' writing is enjoyable and contributes to the overall appeal of the book.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - The novel is a fresh twist on urban fantasy, blending vampires, romance, and bloody scenes. It tackles serious themes like racism and black history while maintaining an entertaining tone.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite the pacing issues, the book is worth reading for fans of urban fantasy. It’s a cool take on the genre, and I’m excited to read the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis 1920s Harlem-set urban fantasy offers a unique blend of vampires, romance, and social commentary. While the pacing is uneven at times, the compelling characters, immersive setting, and fresh take on the genre make it an enjoyable read. I look forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Some of the deaths were sad, but the vicious tone aligned perfectly with the enemies-to-lovers vampire theme.  \n\n- **Romantic Development (Slow Burn):**  \n   - The romance was a proper slow burn, with the main characters hating each other for about 70% of the book. However, I felt the transition from enemies to lovers was more like a switch being flipped rather than a gradual shift. That said, this might have been influenced by my lack of sleep while reading.  \n\n- **World-Building and Supernatural Elements:**  \n   - I loved how vampirism (or reaperhood) was deeply connected to history. The supernatural elements interacted with the setting in a purposeful way, which I appreciated. I’m excited to see how this develops further in the next book.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (Side Characters):**  \n   - I wasn’t entirely satisfied with where some of the relationship dynamics went, particularly involving side characters rather than the leads. However, since this is the first book in a duology, I’m hopeful these issues will be resolved in the next installment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I’ve been eagerly anticipating this book, and while I had a few minor quibbles, it also delivered some delightful surprises. I was thoroughly invested and would definitely recommend it. I’m looking forward to reading the next book in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a few minor issues, this book delivered a bloody, slow-burn enemies-to-lovers vampire story with strong world-building and purposeful supernatural elements. While some relationship dynamics involving side characters left me wanting more, I remain hopeful for resolution in the sequel.

Layla shines as a standout character, embodying a complex blend of ruthlessness and inherent kindness reminiscent of a Fanon Kaz Brekker type.

I appreciated how she called Elise out on her prejudiced views and didn’t let her get away with anything.  \n   - Elise was harder for me to like. While she was complicated, she seemed blind to her privilege.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of a lesbian vampire x vampire hunter romance in 1926 Harlem was intriguing, the execution fell short for me. The pacing was slow, the world-building lacked depth, and while I enjoyed certain aspects of the character dynamics, I wished for more development in their relationship and backstory. Layla stood out as a strong character, but Elise’s flaws made her less likable. Overall, the book had potential but didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel was marketed as a sapphic vampire story, but the interactions between the two women were minimal.

She carried the book with her strength and complexity. I wish there had been more of an enemies vibe between her and Elise, though.  \n  - Elise’s father was unlikable, as he seemed more concerned with public image and having a worthy heir than anything else.  \n  - Sterling’s storyline broke my heart, and I felt deeply for his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The mysterious killings and the investigation into a potential cure for vampires were intriguing plot points.

            "The transition from enemies to allies was well-paced, and I appreciated the angst between the characters. However, the ending felt flat, lacking clear resolution, and the first book didn’t sufficiently encourage me to continue. Despite my frustrations, I’m still curious about the direction of the second book. At times, the characters' actions and motivations seemed inconsistent, as if influenced by reaper venom. The plot also had several inconsistencies, particularly regarding characterization and logic. For example, Layla and Elise made out while Layla's sister was still missing, and their mother was unaware, which felt like a baffling lack of priority. Additionally, Layla killing Valeriya—who might have known her sister's whereabouts—seemed illogical; it felt like her father was the one who truly deserved retribution.",
            "Layla emerged as the standout character who truly carried the story; without her, I probably would have stopped reading. The other characters, including the second female lead, Elise, were largely insufferable. Initially, I found Sterling to be my second favorite, but he ultimately became just as frustrating as the rest. Jamie, however, remained consistent and earned my favor instead. The characters' decision-making and dialogue often felt confusing and disruptive. For instance, Valeriya advised Layla to cooperate with the Saints and police, only to later question whether Layla was prioritizing the Saints over her own clan.",

            "Layla and Elise’s relationship captivated me with its intensity—they were profoundly in love and yearning for one another. As a fan of sapphic vampires and the friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope, I found their dynamic enthralling. Their past traumas added depth to their bond, making their love feel even more urgent. I appreciated both Layla's and Elise’s perspectives, often finding myself relating to their experiences more than I anticipated. The intricate layers of their personal histories and present lives, alongside their home situations, kept me thoroughly engaged.",

            "I loved how Haley depicted toxic and manipulative parental relationships; every time Tobias Saint spoke, I felt on edge.",
            "Elise's relationship with her father evoked profound emotions in me, leaving me both screaming and crying. It strikingly mirrored my own troubled relationship with my mother, resonating in all the wrong ways.",

Even then, I didn’t find myself rooting for the romance.  \n   - I felt more potential chemistry and romance between Jamie and Layla than between the main characters.  \n   - I was more invested in seeing the characters repair their friendship and uncover the specifics of their fallout than in their romantic relationship.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story had good bones and an interesting new perspective on vampires, but it suffered from wild pacing issues.  \n   - The pacing made it difficult for me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - There was a lack of character development and understanding, particularly for the secondary characters.  \n   - This lack of depth made it harder for me to connect with the story and its characters.  \n\n- **Overall Expectations**  \n   - Don’t come into this expecting an incredible enemies-to-lovers plotline, as you might be disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise and a fresh take on vampires, it fell short of my expectations due to genre misalignment, pacing issues, and underdeveloped characters. The romance didn’t resonate with me, and I found myself more interested in the friendship dynamics and backstory than the romantic plotline.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the author demonstrated an understanding of her vampire-like creations, this knowledge did not translate effectively into the writing. As a result, the intricacies of these creatures and the world they inhabit remained unclear, leaving me unable to explain key aspects of the narrative.",

            "The mystery element was confusing and lacked clarity. I struggled to understand the actions and motivations of the characters. There were vague references to a serum in the alcohol, a mayoral candidate's power ambitions that were never fully explored, and a scientist whose motives seemed muddled. Furthermore, something was affecting Elise’s family, but it was unclear what it was or how long it had been occurring."

The idea of vampire-adjacent creatures in 1920s Harlem, combined with queer protagonists and a mystery to solve, was excellent. It had so much potential.  \n- **Execution:**  \n  Unfortunately, the execution of the novel was horrible. The story was confusing, and I rarely understood what was happening throughout the entire read.  \n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was extremely hard to follow. I was confused from start to finish. The author seemed to understand her vampire-adjacent creations, but this understanding didn’t translate well into the writing. I couldn’t explain how these creatures worked or what the world knew about them.  \n- **Mystery:**  \n  The mystery element was equally unclear. I had no idea who was doing what to whom. There were vague references to something in the alcohol, a serum (with no explanation of its purpose), a mayoral candidate seeking power (but it was unclear what they were doing to achieve it), and a scientist whose motivations and actions were muddled. Additionally, something was happening to Elise’s family, but I couldn’t grasp what it was or how long it had been going on.  \n- **Editing:**  \n  The editing was a major issue. The author is clearly a first-time writer, and the lack of thorough editing was glaring. The writing quality was poor enough that it stood out to me, which is rare. With better editing, this book could have been engaging, but as it stands, it’s just a confusing and frustrating read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of the book was intriguing and full of potential, the execution fell flat.

            "This book features dual narrators: Elise Saint, an 18-year-old exiled to France after being attacked by her former best friend turned reaper, and Layla Quinn, an 18-year-old reaper who has been part of Valeriya's clan for five years. Set in 1920s Harlem during Prohibition, the story offers a refreshing perspective with a predominantly Black cast. However, the parents of the main characters feel underdeveloped, lacking depth that could have enriched the story. Additionally, the narrative suffers from repetitiveness, as events are often reiterated through the inner monologues of both Elise and Layla, disrupting the flow. The frequent death threats throughout the narrative also become tiresome and lose their impact over time.",
            "The historical fiction elements are commendable, especially in how the book addresses themes of segregation and racial challenges of the period. However, I would have liked to see more extensive worldbuilding and a deeper exploration of Harlem during that time."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book offers a unique and refreshing take on historical fiction with its 1920s Harlem setting and predominantly Black cast. The dual narrators provide interesting perspectives, though the repetitive nature of their inner monologues and the underdeveloped parental characters detract from the story. The inclusion of queer elements is a highlight, and while I won’t continue with the duology, I remain open to exploring other works by the author.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Characters:**\n   - The book features dual narrators: Elise Saint, an 18-year-old who was attacked by her former best friend turned reaper and exiled to France for safety, and Layla Quinn, an 18-year-old reaper who was turned five years ago and now lives with Valeriya and her clan.\n   - The story is set in 1920s Harlem during prohibition, offering a refreshing take with a predominantly Black cast.\n   - The parents of the main characters feel underdeveloped and lack depth, which could have been improved.\n\n- **Historical Context and Representation:**\n   - The historical fiction aspect is impressive, particularly how the book weaves in themes of segregation and racial difficulties of the time.\n   - However, I would have appreciated more detailed worldbuilding and a deeper exploration of Harlem during that era.\n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**\n   - The book suffers from repetition, with events being recounted through the inner monologues of both Elise and Layla, which hampers the flow of the story.\n   - There are also numerous death threats throughout the narrative, which become repetitive and lose their impact over time.\n\n- **Queer Representation:**\n   - I loved the inclusion of queer elements in the book, which added depth and diversity to the story.\n\n- **Series Potential and Author's Work:**\n   - While this book is part of a duology, I do not plan to read the second installment. However, I would be interested in reading other works by the same author.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book offers a unique and refreshing take on historical fiction with its 1920s Harlem setting and predominantly Black cast. The dual narrators provide interesting perspectives, though the repetitive nature of their inner monologues and the underdeveloped parental characters detract from the story. The inclusion of queer elements is a highlight, and while I won’t continue with the duology, I remain open to exploring other works by the author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book features a captivating and intricate plot with multiple layers. Elise Saint faces significant challenges, such as being blamed for her sister Charlotte’s death and sent to Paris to study music. The central conflict revolves around Elise and her best friend Layla, who has become a reaper, as they investigate why reapers are transforming into humans before dying. Tension simmers between them; despite vowing to kill each other once their mission concludes, their shared goal compels them to collaborate. While some early predictions about Sterling’s role proved accurate, this did not diminish the story's enjoyment. Additionally, the narrative leaves intriguing possibilities for future developments, particularly concerning Jaime/Vex and other characters, heightening anticipation for the next installment.",
            "In this story, Elise emerges as a strong protagonist, fiercely protective of her younger sister, Josi. Layla, now a reaper, resides with a clan that claims to reject harm toward humans—though this promise remains questionable. The relationship between Elise and Layla is complex, marked by hatred and unresolved tension, yet they find themselves needing to collaborate. Adding to the conflict, Elise's father, who oversees the Saint empire, manipulates events to eradicate reapers. Valeriya, the head of the reaper clan, significantly influences Layla's motivations. Meanwhile, Sterling and Jaime (or Vex) are compelling characters whose hinted futures create an air of anticipation.",
            "The story revolves around the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and sacrifice. Emotional stakes soar as Elise fights to protect her sister while Layla grapples with her identity as a reaper. The tension between promises and the potential for unforeseen complications keeps me thoroughly engaged."

The tension between Elise and Layla, along with the overarching conflict involving reapers and humans, keeps the story engaging. While some elements were predictable, the overall narrative leaves plenty of room for future surprises and developments.",

They go from being enemies due to Layla almost killing Elise to becoming teammates to uncover why a boy named Theo was a reaper but died a human.  \n  Probably the best character with the most energy was Layla.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  - The premise of the book was highly intriguing and one of my most anticipated reads of the year. The idea of Black queer vampires in Jazz Age NYC was incredibly appealing and full of potential.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - I actually enjoyed the writing itself. The author’s prose had moments of promise and creativity.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  - The flow of the plot was clunky and disjointed. I often found myself confused from one paragraph to another because significant issues were left undiscussed or poorly explained.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The relationships between characters, particularly Elise and Layla, felt underdeveloped and unconvincing. I had a hard time rooting for their relationship or even for them as individual characters.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  - The dialogue often felt out of place or unnatural, which disrupted the immersion in the story.  \n\n- **Editing and Pacing:**  \n  - The book desperately needed another round of editing. The pacing and structure of the story were inconsistent, which detracted from the overall reading experience.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Works:**  \n  - Despite my issues with this book, I believe the author, Hayley Dennings, has potential. With a solid editing team, she could release some wonderful books in the future. I’m willing to try another one of her works, though not in the *This Ravenous Fate* universe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *This Ravenous Fate* had a captivating premise and moments of strong writing, its execution fell short due to clunky plot flow, underdeveloped relationships, and unnatural dialogue. The book would have greatly benefited from additional editing. Despite these flaws, I remain hopeful about the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The initial friends phase lacked depth, and while the transition to enemies was well-defined, the shift to lovers was unconvincing.

The book might still resonate with young adult fantasy fans who enjoy mystery-driven plots.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her internal conflict over her reaperhood (vampirism) and her complex love-hate relationship with Elise are stunning and deeply engaging.\n\n- **Character Development (Elise):**  \n  Elise, however, often makes decisions that don’t make sense. She fails to think things through and repeatedly alienates her allies, even when she knows better. This aspect of her character was frustrating.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing is uneven. The middle of the book feels very long, while the ending rushes through important developments. This imbalance could have been improved by condensing or rearranging some scenes.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Setup:**  \n  The ending leaves several questions unanswered, which works well as a setup for a sequel but feels less satisfying as a standalone read. I hope the sequel delivers on the potential established here.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite some pacing issues and frustrations with Elise’s character, there were parts of the book I really loved. The unique premise and Layla’s character kept me invested.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a captivating premise and a compelling protagonist in Layla, though it struggles with pacing and some character decisions.

Additionally, a scene featuring Elise's drunk father was confusing, as her parents appeared inconsistent with their established personalities. While Elise's motivations rooted in family and her obliviousness to certain issues, along with her privilege, added depth to her character, her father occasionally came off as almost cartoonishly villainous.",

He has such a good position in the story but seemed to be a bit confusing with his motivations and behavior.  \n\n- **Character Development and Consistency:**  \n  There was a scene with Elise's drunk father that was a bit confusing since her parents seemed out of character. Elise's character trait of family motivation and often blindness to issues and her privilege made her more interesting, though her father was almost cartoonishly evil at times.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The general plotline was a little slow, but I enjoyed the drawn-out nature of Layla and Elise's relationship.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation and Critique:**  \n  Overall, I'd recommend this, but there were a few spots that felt a bit confused that could easily be fixed by the final cut of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable read with a compelling mix of themes and character dynamics.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Appeal and Initial Expectations:**  \n   - I really wanted to like this. I love vampires. Anything with vampires is an auto-read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Elise's character seemed to be that of the sheltered-annoying-privileged-make-stupid-decisions-that-don't-make-sense kind of personality. I tend to struggle with those, especially in how she treated her supposed second best friend, Sterling.  \n   - I have no idea what the heck happened with HIS character. He 180° so fast I got whiplash.  \n   - Layla was cool though. I vibe with her.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n   - The atmosphere of the story was great—a little dark and gritty.  \n   - The ideas and themes about racism, classism, etc., were fairly well done.  \n\n- **Execution and Overall Quality:**  \n   - I did enjoy parts of it, but it needed more polish.  \n   - The overall execution was just lacking.  \n\n- **Interest in Sequel:**  \n   - I'm not sure if I'll pick up the sequel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling atmosphere and tackled important themes like racism and classism effectively, the execution fell short, and the character development, particularly for Elise and Sterling, left much to be desired. Despite enjoying certain aspects, the lack of polish and inconsistent character arcs made it difficult to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\nThank you NetGalley and Sourcebooks Fire for the ARC.

The first book feels like a setup for the second, which left me wanting more development in this installment.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters include a spoiled rich heiress with a dysfunctional family and a crappy best friend, and a vampire with an untrustworthy surrogate mother. The heiress idolizes her father and takes the entire book to finally stand up for herself and say \"no.\" While the characters have potential, their growth felt slow and incomplete in this book.  \n\n- **Themes and Dynamics:**  \n  The story explores themes of betrayal, trust, and self-empowerment. The dynamic between the two protagonists shifts from friends to enemies to something resembling friends or lovers. However, the relationships and character motivations sometimes felt underdeveloped or inconsistent.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was uneven, with much of the book feeling like a setup for future events rather than a fully realized story on its own. This made the narrative feel incomplete and left me unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has potential with its intriguing premise and character dynamics, it falls short in execution. The first installment feels more like a setup for the second, with slow character development and an incomplete narrative. I didn’t love it, but I see promise for the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3⭐"

            "I enjoyed both protagonists, Layla and Elise, but I agree with most opinions that Layla was the stronger character. Elise's arc was well-developed, showcasing her complexity and depth. I found myself particularly drawn to the dynamic between Layla and Mei, which felt more engaging. Nonetheless, I appreciate Layla and Elise's relationship and look forward to its further development. I do wish the supporting characters, especially Valeriya and Sterling, had received more depth and attention.",

The connection to slavery and the exploitation of Black bodies, particularly Black women, adds a profound and thought-provoking layer. However, I wished the author had fully embraced the 1920s setting, as some writing—especially the dialogue—felt somewhat jarring for the period, possibly due to the constraints of the YA genre.",

I was genuinely excited about the concept.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing was a significant drawback. It felt clumsy, with poor sentence structure and unnatural dialogue choices. The author often didn’t trust the reader to infer who was speaking or the tone of the conversation based on context, which made the narrative feel awkward and disjointed.  \n\n- **Editing:**  \n  The novel desperately needed at least one more editing pass. The lack of polish in the writing was a major issue and detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audio narrator was not a good fit for me. Her style didn’t align with my preferences, and it was disappointing to hear her voice on yet another book I was excited about.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the strong concept, the execution fell short, and I didn’t enjoy the book as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a fantastic premise, the clumsy writing, lack of editing, and subpar audiobook narration made it a disappointing read overall. I wanted to love it, but the execution didn’t live up to the potential of the idea.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 (rounded up to 3 based on the concept and vibes)."

The way Elise and Layla’s relationship cycled around each other, their past, and the 5-year gap between them created the foundation of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked Layla’s POVs more and felt she was the stronger character. However, Elise’s relationship (or lack thereof) with her father had me emotionally invested—I hate that man so much.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and World-Building:**  \n  The switch between POVs, while confusing at times, helped expand on their story and the world around them.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I like the setup for the next book and can’t wait to see more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, particularly the dynamic between Elise and Layla and the strong foundation their relationship provided.

It was right up my alley, and I found it easy to get sucked in and enjoy it.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The story was engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially as it aligns with my interests in black sapphic representation and the fantasy/murder mystery genre.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  Where it started to lose me a bit was towards the end. The way things were wrapped up didn’t feel entirely complete, leaving me wanting more closure.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Anticipation:**  \n  I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in black sapphic stories within the fantasy/murder mystery realm. I plan on getting my own copy when it releases and can’t wait for the second book, which I believe is part of a duology and will hopefully tie up any loose ends from the first book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its premise, plot, and representation, though the ending felt slightly incomplete. I’m excited for the sequel and would recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 (rounded up to 4)."

It kept me engaged and interested throughout.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters fell kind of flat for me. I would have loved to see more of Layla and Elise being enemies, as it felt like their dynamic was told rather than shown. Additionally, I could not stand Elise. She came across as a spoiled rich girl, and I felt the author could have done so much more to develop her character.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The concept of sapphic Black vampires was a standout element for me. It’s a unique and compelling premise that I truly appreciated.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my issues with the characters, I will be picking up the next book in the series because the premise is too intriguing to pass up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had mixed feelings about the characters, particularly Elise, the engaging plot and the unique representation of sapphic Black vampires made the book worth reading. I’m looking forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating score was mentioned in the review."

It seemed like it was only included to create tension between her and Layla, especially since they had just reconciled. This made the conflict feel forced and less believable.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues with pacing and character decisions, I found the story engaging and enjoyable overall. It held my interest and had compelling elements that made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had its flaws, particularly in pacing and some character decisions, it was still an engaging and enjoyable story. The inconsistent pacing and Elise’s abrupt decision detracted from the overall experience, but the narrative’s strengths made it a satisfying read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their lack of consistency made it difficult for me to feel invested in their journeys.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The ending felt rushed and unfulfilling. It didn’t provide the closure or satisfaction I was hoping for after investing time in the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I absolutely loved the atmosphere of Black lesbians in 1920s Harlem. The setting was vibrant and immersive, and it was one of the strongest aspects of the book for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for this book and adored its unique setting, the inconsistent character development and rushed ending left me feeling disappointed. The atmosphere was a standout, but it wasn’t enough to make up for the other shortcomings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The predictable mystery and obvious villains diminished the thrill of guessing, while the characters' cluelessness about their surroundings caused the story to drag, even as the reader was left in the know. Additionally, the world-building felt underdeveloped, relying too heavily on unnatural exposition through dialogue.",

While Elise grew on me, the rest of the cast felt forgettable, serving primarily to support or oppose the main characters without any depth or lives outside their interactions with Layla and Elise. The childhood friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope was underdeveloped; the glimpses into their past friendship became repetitive and lacked emotional resonance. Their romance suffered from a lack of chemistry and tension, particularly during the forced proximity scenes. Additionally, the dialogue between Elise and Layla often felt unnatural, lacking the necessary buildup for their exchanges. Although the ending featured some sweet moments, the romance ultimately fell short of its potential.",

The story would have benefited from a deeper exploration of these complexities alongside the theme of humans exploiting reapers."

The narrative expertly weaves between the present and flashbacks, deepening the characters and their shared history.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel tackles racial injustice in America, using the creation of reapers as a metaphor for the violence and oppression inflicted on Black people. It also explores privilege, as Elise confronts harsh truths about her family’s role in perpetuating systemic harm while working alongside Layla.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  A dark, sapphic romance simmers between Layla and Elise, marked by tragedy and unresolved desire. Their evolving relationship takes center stage, sometimes overshadowing the murder investigation in the middle section of the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing is generally strong, with Dennings skillfully balancing the present-day narrative and flashbacks. However, the murder investigation occasionally gets lost amidst the focus on the romance and character development.  \n\n- **World-Building and Genre:**  \n  The urban fantasy world is vibrant and violent, blending historical elements with supernatural twists. The reaper mythology is deeply tied to America’s history of racial violence, adding depth and complexity to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*This Ravenous Fate* is a gripping, twisty urban fantasy that combines a dark sapphic romance with a powerful exploration of racial injustice. While the murder investigation occasionally takes a backseat to the romance, the novel excels in character development, world-building, and thematic depth. It’s a compelling start to a young adult duology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Set in 1926 New York, the story follows the Saint family, leading figures in the reaper-hunting business, as they confront the rising threat of vampire-like creatures called reapers. Elise Saint, the reluctant heir, teams up with Layla Quinn, a reaper burdened by a tragic past, to investigate a series of mysterious killings tied to rumors of a potential cure for reapers. While the premise is compelling, the plot lacks clarity and fails to deliver a memorable experience, despite its promising foundation.",

            "The story begins strongly and captivates the reader, but Act 2 struggles with pacing. The investigation lacks urgency, resulting in a drawn-out narrative that can feel tedious and confusing. Additionally, some elements, such as Layla’s passion for dance, are introduced but not fully developed.",
            "While the sapphic romance is heavily promoted, it ultimately disappoints. The transition from enemies to lovers feels sudden and shallow; a deeper exploration of longing and pining would have strengthened the emotional connection. The backstory between Layla and Elise is insufficiently developed, rendering their love declaration unconvincing. Elise's father comes across as a manipulative character, while Sterling's actions make him feel entirely unlikable. The antagonists are also predictable, lacking any real depth or complexity.",

While the lore feels slightly underdeveloped and the pacing uneven, the mystery and fantasy elements shine. The romance, though not a personal favorite, adds to the story. Overall, it’s a promising start to the series, and I look forward to the sequel.",
