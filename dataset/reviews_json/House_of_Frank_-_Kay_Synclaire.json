Her kindness mirrored the emotional depth of this story. It felt like a kind gesture, but the book amplified that feeling even more. People need this story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Beyond the unique and lovable characters, the story showcases many different kinds of love, making it truly precious.  \n\n- **Author and Publisher's Choice:**  \n  Jaysen couldn't have chosen a more perfect story.

The cozy tone and emotional depth seem like they would lend themselves well to a visual medium.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I’d like to thank Bindery Books and NetGalley for providing me with a complimentary copy of the book. It was a delightful read overall.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cozy and enjoyable read, though I had mixed feelings about certain character interactions. The story’s emotional depth and tone make it a strong candidate for an animated adaptation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Instead, it focuses on themes of grief and healing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters are working through grief, both their own and that of the people who come to Ash Gardens for burial ceremonies.  \n  - While I liked most of the relationships in the book, the large number of characters made it difficult to fully get to know each one.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - I loved the writing style and will definitely read Kay Synclaire’s books in the future.  \n  - The second-person interjections at the beginning were initially challenging, but I eventually got used to them.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story was very sweet and made me cry just the right amount.  \n  - I had some minor nitpicky issues, like wishing Phil had access to a piece of paper and a pen.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite a few small complaints, I found the book to be a heartfelt and emotional read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*House of Frank* is a touching and cozy fantasy that beautifully explores themes of grief and healing. While the large cast of characters made it hard to connect deeply with everyone, the writing style and emotional depth of the story left a lasting impression. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from Kay Synclaire.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

This approach didn’t work for me—it was distracting at first and eventually became very annoying.  \n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  I see what the book was trying to achieve, particularly with the found family aspect.

The main character felt a bit underwhelming in comparison, which is a common issue in novels.  \n\n- **Diversity:**  \n  The diversity in the story was well-executed and something I truly appreciated.  \n\n- **Themes and Handling of Loss:**  \n  The way the novel dealt with loss was touching and well-handled, adding depth to the emotional core of the story.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  While the worldbuilding was interesting, it lacked some depth, leaving room for further exploration.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was cute and enjoyable, though it could have benefited from more development to make it even more impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws, *House of Frank* is a heartfelt and emotionally resonant novel that offers comfort and warmth. Its strong emotional impact, diverse characters, and touching exploration of loss make it a highly recommended read, especially for those seeking solace.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific numerical rating was provided, but the reviewer expressed a strong recommendation (\"100% recommend\")."

Despite being repeatedly told that the characters cared for each other, their actions suggested otherwise. There was a lack of genuine connection or chemistry among them.  \n\n- **Plot Consistency and Logic:**  \n  - The story suffered from inconsistencies and illogical character behavior. For instance, Frank’s situation was glaringly problematic, yet no one seemed to address it. Additionally, characters who should have known each other well appeared to be strangers, including Frank and his wife, which made the relationships feel unrealistic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - The pacing failed to hold my interest, and I ultimately decided not to finish the book.

The idea of Ash Garden, where loved ones' ashes are transformed into living trees, is both charming and original.

Frank, the owner of the garden, offers her a job until she is ready to fulfill her task. The concept of Ash Garden, where loved ones' ashes are turned into living trees, is sweet and unique. The casual integration of magic into the world is also a refreshing element.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Saika, the main character, is portrayed as unlikable, judgmental, and self-centered. While her grief over her sister's death is understandable, her inability to take responsibility for her actions, particularly how she hurt Frank, makes her difficult to root for. Her co-dependent relationship with her sister further complicates her character.\n\n- **Found Family Trope:**  \n  The found family dynamic, which is a favorite trope of mine, falls flat in this book. The group feels disjointed rather than cohesive. Characters make teasing comments that come across as mean-spirited, and there is a lack of meaningful connection among them. For example, Phil, a ghost who cannot speak, is not helped by the others to communicate, and the group seems unaware of basic details about each other despite living together for years.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The time period of the story is unclear, with moments that feel modern and others that feel old, creating a disconcerting effect. This inconsistency detracts from the immersion in the world.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the promising premise and glowing reviews, the book did not meet my expectations. The unlikable protagonist, disjointed found family, and inconsistent setting made it difficult for me to enjoy the story. However, I acknowledge that others may find it appealing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of Ash Garden and the casual use of magic are intriguing, the unlikable protagonist, disjointed found family, and inconsistent setting made the book fall short for me.

It explores themes of loss, healing, and reconnection through the lens of a magical arboretum.  \n\n- **Plot & Pacing:**  \n  The story follows Saika, who fulfills her sister’s final wish to be buried in the House of Frank’s arboretum. She becomes a caretaker there, joining a chaotic staff and navigating strange events, including a storm that threatens the arboretum and the owner’s odd behavior. The last quarter of the book is stronger and more fast-paced compared to the slower first three-quarters.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are relatively bland, which seems common in the cozy genre. Saika’s grief makes her subdued, but the other characters lack memorability and fail to balance her out. Olivie, a Nature witch, stands out as a complex figure who initially dislikes Saika but shares a connection with her.  \n\n- **Setting & World-Building:**  \n  The arboretum as a funeral facility and a place of healing is a unique and enjoyable concept. The magical elements, such as witches and dragons, add depth to the world. The exploration of the owner’s wife’s story parallels Saika’s past and enriches the narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The narration style is unusual, with the heroine addressing her dead sister throughout the story. This approach feels jarring at first but becomes poetic over time. It’s a creative decision that may not resonate with all readers.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact & Themes:**  \n  The story effectively portrays grief, healing, and the importance of found family. Saika’s journey of embracing new love, reconnecting with family, and finding purpose is emotionally resonant. The parallels between her past and the owner’s wife’s story add depth to the themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The House of Frank* is a cozy fantasy with a unique setting and heartfelt themes of grief and healing.

While it deals with themes like death and losing a loved one, I found it wasn’t overly sad or heavy. I felt sympathy for the main characters, Saika and Frank, but I didn’t emotionally connect with them, which affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n- **Concept and World-Building:**  \n  I appreciated the unique concept of a magical arboretum where loved ones’ ashes are planted to grow into beautiful, unique trees. The world-building was well-executed, and the story included diverse representation among the characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven, particularly because it took too long to reveal Saika’s full backstory. Additionally, the frequent switching between first and second-person narrative was distracting and disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Many of the characters felt one-dimensional and seemed tailored for a younger audience, which made it harder for me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a compelling concept and strong world-building, the uneven pacing, lack of emotional connection with the characters, and distracting narrative shifts made it just an okay read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The pacing felt uneven, and I struggled to stay fully engaged throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Saika’s grief and continuous struggle to grow from, or perhaps through, the death of her sister, Fiona, didn’t grab me.
