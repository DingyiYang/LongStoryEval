One is determined to share his authentic narrative, rooted in his family's experiences and showcasing the realities of indigenous life, but faces rejection and forced edits that dilute his message.

The haunted castle and the town’s history add a perfect spooky atmosphere, making it an ideal fall read.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Two of the authors have a history of conflict. One dreams of publishing his true story, inspired by his own family experiences, which highlights realistic tales of indigenous people. However, his work has been rejected and edited to be “palatable” to readers. The other author is angry at him for being a sellout and struggles to get her voice heard in her own writing. Their dynamic evolves from enemies to lovers as they are forced into close proximity during the retreat, fighting off ghosts and their growing feelings for each other.  \n\n- **Narration and POV:**  \n  I enjoyed the alternation between narrators and POVs, which allowed us to see firsthand what the two main characters were thinking and feeling as the story progressed. The book is narrated by Curtis Michael Holland and Kyla Garcia, and they both did a great job bringing the characters to life.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This was a cute, fun fall read with all the right vibes—spooky, romantic, and engaging. It’s a perfect blend of being deliciously haunted with a side dose of romance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a delightful spooky read with a rich setting, compelling characters, and a well-executed enemies-to-lovers romance.

            "The romance between Penelope and Neil feels rushed, moving too quickly from mutual dislike to intimate moments, which detracts from the emotional depth and steaminess of their relationship. I tend to favor slow-burn romances that allow characters to gradually fall in love. Additionally, the characters often make questionable, almost comical decisions, reminiscent of classic horror movie archetypes. Their antics inject a layer of humor that kept me entertained.",

            "The book is marketed as a steamy enemies-to-lovers romance and a chilling horror story, but it falls short on both fronts. Instead, it reads more like a romcom or parody of a haunted house. Best suited for readers who enjoy lighthearted romcoms and are comfortable with clichés, this book makes for a fun autumn read but may disappoint those looking for a genuine romance or horror experience."

It feels more like a romcom/parody of a haunted house rather than a genuine romance or thriller.  \n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance between Penelope and Neil lacks buildup. They transition from disliking each other to intimate scenes too quickly, which diminishes the emotional depth and steaminess. I prefer slow-burn romances where characters gradually fall in love.  \n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings, the book is a massive page-turner. I finished it in two days and found myself revisiting it even during short breaks. The pacing keeps you hooked.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is well-written, and while it leans into clichés, it embraces the haunted house trope in a way that feels intentional and enjoyable.  \n- **Character Decisions:**  \n  The characters often make questionable, almost comical decisions, reminiscent of the \"How to not survive a horror movie\" archetype. Their antics add a layer of humor and kept me entertained.  \n- **Target Audience:**  \n  This book is best suited for readers who enjoy romcoms and don’t mind clichés. It’s a light, fun read, especially for autumn, but may not appeal to those seeking a genuine romance or horror experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book doesn’t fully meet its advertised promises of being a steamy romance or a chilling horror, it excels as a humorous, cliché-filled romcom with a haunted house twist.

You don’t need to be enrolled, you don’t need to look Native to be Native. You’re Native, and so long as you know, that’s enough. There will always be someone who says otherwise, but they’re buying into a system created by colonizers. You’re enough, Penelope Skinner.”  \n  - “And where her mind was normally filled with noise, the only thoughts flitting about were of him.”  \n  - “Are you looking?” she called.

You didn’t really specify.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a delightful and spooky read that combined cozy and creepy elements effectively.

            "The story revolves around Pen and Neil, two Native authors with differing approaches to reclaiming Native stereotypes. Their rivalry escalates publicly, prompting Pen to go into hiding while Neil grapples with writer’s block. The two eventually reunite at a haunted castle retreat, where they are partnered for writing activities and encounter real spirits.",
            "This book features a diverse cast, prominently showcasing two main characters who represent American Indian populations. It effectively amplifies the voices of previously marginalized groups, particularly within traditional publishing. The story allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of others' experiences, and I appreciate the awareness and advocacy it fosters. Neil Storm embodies a range of admirable qualities: he is apologetic, caring, thoughtful, generous, and honest. While the characters initially felt somewhat flat and one-dimensional, the audiobook brought them to life, making them more relatable and engaging. The friendship between Pen and Neil evolves into a deeper connection, enriched by well-executed romantic and spicy elements that add significant depth to their relationship.",

The representation of American Indian voices and the haunted castle setting were standout elements. Though not for everyone, it’s a thought-provoking and enjoyable read for those who appreciate its themes and genre blend.",

            "The story primarily focuses on Neil and Penelope, who are the only characters with significant backstories. While one ghost is briefly explored, I wished for more depth in her narrative and further development of the other characters to enhance their believability. I found Penelope to be an unlikable character; she often wallows in self-pity and shifts blame for her disappointments onto others. Her tendency to victim-shame Neil, particularly after assaulting him, was particularly frustrating. Although there is some character growth, it fell short of my expectations. Penelope owed Neil a more genuine apology for her actions and for attempting to deflect responsibility onto him.",

Despite these flaws, it’s a fun read that will likely resonate with fans of the horror genre, especially around Halloween.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Originality:**  \n  The premise of the book is great and not something I've seen before, which made me excited to read it. The idea of a haunted castle in Scotland and the dynamic between the two main characters, both struggling with writer's block, was intriguing and unique.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The only two characters who receive significant backstory are Neil and Penelope. While we learn a bit about one ghost, I would have liked more depth in her backstory and more development for the other characters to make them feel more alive.  \n\n- **Romantic and Steamy Scenes:**  \n  There were a lot of steamy scenes, and they were well-written for the most part. However, the portions from Penelope's point of view in these scenes were consistently better than Neil's.  \n\n- **Character Likability and Growth:**  \n  I didn't find Penelope a particularly likable character. She often feels sorry for herself and blames others for her disappointments. Her tendency to victim-shame Neil, especially after assaulting him, was frustrating. While there is some growth in her character, it wasn't as much as I would have liked. She owed him a more sincere apology for her actions and for trying to shift the blame onto him.  \n\n- **Pacing and Entertainment Value:**  \n  The book was entertaining and a quick read. With its mid-October release date, I think it will appeal to readers looking for a spooky, seasonal read, even though it’s not specifically about Halloween.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book has a strong and original premise, with an engaging setting and entertaining pacing. However, the character development, particularly for secondary characters, felt lacking, and Penelope's unlikable traits and insufficient growth detracted from my enjoyment. Despite these flaws, it’s a fun read that will likely resonate with fans of the horror genre, especially around Halloween.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded up to 4."

Both Penelope and Neil initially made mistakes, but I appreciated their willingness to communicate and grow. Penelope took time to recognize her missteps, while Neil wrestled with his own internal conflicts. However, the side characters were underdeveloped, leaving me with no strong feelings about them. Laszlo and Daniela came across as weak friends and felt irrelevant to the main plot. Given their limited interactions, it seemed like the story could have benefited from additional characters, as the conversations primarily revolved around just two of the main four, making the cast feel sparse.",

Penelope and Neil were initially in the wrong, but I was glad they talked things through. It took Penelope a while to admit her reaction was wrong, and Neil had his own internal struggles to overcome.  \n\n- **Paranormal/Horror Elements:**  \n  The paranormal aspect of the book fell a little flat for me. Ghosts are a hard sell for me, and the haunting left me confused with more questions than answers. The way it all played out didn’t feel believable, which kept me from fully loving it.  \n\n- **Side Characters and Character Interactions:**  \n  The side characters didn’t get much page time, so I don’t have strong opinions about them. Laszlo and Daniela kind of suck as friends and ended up being irrelevant to the plot. It felt like there should have been more characters, especially since Daniela and Laszlo barely interacted with each other. With only two of the four characters seemingly having conversations, the cast felt \"empty.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the issues with the paranormal elements and side characters, I enjoyed reading the book overall. I loved the writing style and will certainly be reading more from this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the paranormal aspects didn’t work for me and the side characters felt underdeveloped, the romance and character dynamics were strong and enjoyable.

While the pacing of the romance feels a bit rushed, the humor and unique setting make it an entertaining read. It has the potential to be the start of a series, which could further explore its themes and characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their arguments/conversations throughout the book initially felt repetitive, but there was incremental progress made each time, which allowed them to both grow and see beyond their own worldviews to understand each other more deeply.  \n\n- **Character Behavior:**  \n  Pen's tendency to run headfirst into questionable situations, and Neil's tendency to follow after her, were kind of concerning, especially given the warnings the groundskeeper gives them at the start of the retreat.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  I loved Laszlo's support of both Pen and Neil. He and Daniela definitely could have used more screen time and development.  \n\n- **Paranormal/Mystery Elements:**  \n  The paranormal/mystery elements added a fun dimension and helped build the relationship of the main characters, but I did feel like it was underdeveloped. The story of the ghosts was haphazardly put together. There was no real explanation for the connection between Pen and the ghost, or why Neil was able to see them as well.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The setting of the retreat in an old Scottish castle added to the allure of the mystery. I also loved the nod to *Outlander* toward the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable romcom with a touch of paranormal mystery. While the character dynamics were engaging and the setting was charming, the paranormal elements felt underdeveloped, and some supporting characters could have been given more depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This enemies-to-lovers story features a haunting twist. Native authors Penelope Skinner and Neil Storm begin as adversaries but find themselves spending time together at a writing retreat in a creepy castle. As their relationship develops, paranormal events add an intriguing layer to the romance. The narrative is both unique and provides a deeper insight into Native writing culture.",
            "The dynamic between the main characters, Skinner and Storm, is engaging, yet their development falls short. A slower build in their relationship and greater depth in their personal growth would have added layers to the narrative. Additionally, the side characters lack sufficient development, which detracts from the overall richness of the story. The book features a moderate level of spice (3/5) and a subtle amount of paranormal elements (2.75/5). While these aspects are well-integrated, amplifying their presence could enhance the overall experience.",

Penelope Skinner and Neil Storm, both Native authors, start off as adversaries but are forced to spend time together at a writing retreat in a creepy castle. As they grow closer, paranormal events unfold, adding a spooky element to the romance. The storyline is unique and offers deeper insight into Native writing culture.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main characters, Skinner and Storm, have a compelling dynamic, but their development feels somewhat flat. I would have liked to see a slower burn in their relationship and more depth in their personal growth. Additionally, the side characters could have been more developed to enrich the story.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book is well-written, with a good balance of romance, tension, and paranormal elements. The author effectively builds sexual tension between the main characters and creates an eerie atmosphere in the castle.\n\n- **Spice and Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The book has a medium level of spice (3/5) and a moderate amount of paranormal activity (2.75/5). These elements are well-integrated into the story but could have been more pronounced to heighten the overall impact.\n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope is executed well, and the exploration of Native writing culture adds a meaningful layer to the narrative. The paranormal twist sets it apart from typical romcoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to fans of romcoms with a paranormal twist.

Penelope, despite her flaws, has a loud and brash personality that feels authentic. In contrast, Neil starts off as somewhat arrogant but quickly shifts to a sad, insecure character.

Laszlo and Daniela served as decent side characters, though I felt they lacked development. I would have liked more insight into Fanny and her family, as they seemed underexplored. The book features commendable BIPOC and queer representation, which I valued. Penelope's struggles with her Native American identity and her critique of Neil’s stereotypes enriched the narrative. While the romance leaned towards cheesy, it was nonetheless enjoyable, with a spice level of around 2.5-3/5 stars.

            "In this story, Pen and Neil escape by jumping a fence, but Pen struggles due to her height. Neil hoists her up, and during the process, his hand accidentally brushes her thigh, leaving her feeling more intrigued than she expected. As they delve into the mystery of the haunted castle, creepy occurrences escalate. By the end, they uncover the truth and discover what they want to write for their own books.\n\nInitially, I expected a light-hearted rom-com with some spooky elements, but it turned out to be much more—a thrilling blend of romance and comedy that was thoroughly enjoyable. The retreat consists of just four attendees: Pen, Neil, Laszlo, and Louise. Neil and Pen are understandably angry and try to avoid each other, but they eventually reach the castle, which certainly has a spooky ambiance.\n\nTo their surprise, they learn that it's genuinely haunted, and they received a substantial discount for that reason. Overall, I found this book delightful and far beyond my initial expectations.",

Sharing the stage is Neil, a bestselling author whom she despises for his negative portrayal of Native characters.

Their mutual anger leads them to agree to keep their distance, but when Neil unexpectedly lifts her, his hand brushes against her thigh, igniting feelings she didn't anticipate.",

The side characters, Laszlo and Daniela, lack depth and serve primarily as plot devices to bring Penelope and Neil together before fading into the background.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The romantic connection between Penelope and Neil develops gradually, adding an engaging layer to the story. Their journey from adversaries to potential partners is believable and adds emotional depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Horror and Mystery Elements:**  \n  The haunting mystery is predictable from the start and lacks genuine scares. The ghost’s characterization as malevolent and dangerous feels inconsistent, with Penelope and Neil oscillating between fear and indifference. This uneven portrayal diminishes the tension and impact of the supernatural elements.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is enjoyable overall. The engaging dynamic between Penelope and Neil, along with their personal growth, compensates for the weaker aspects of the plot and side characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *If I Stopped Haunting You* has its shortcomings, including predictable horror elements and underdeveloped side characters, it remains an enjoyable read due to the compelling relationship between Penelope and Neil and their individual growth. The book’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses, making it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  \n\nThank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the electronic ARC of this novel for review."

            "I appreciated the plot's premise, centering on rival writers at a haunted castle retreat. The commentary on the challenges faced by Indigenous authors in the publishing industry struck a chord with me, particularly the struggle to modify their work to cater to mainstream tastes, often at the expense of the original draft's authenticity and depth.",
            "I found the romance in the story enjoyable and entertaining. However, I wasn't fond of the manipulative traits of the female main character (FMC). She and the male main character (MMC) repeatedly have the same conversation, with her stubbornly revisiting the same argument despite his attempts to explain his perspective. Additionally, her behavior, such as blaming the MMC for her career struggles while disregarding her own impulsive actions (like throwing a book at him in public), felt immature and overshadowed her valid points. I would have preferred a more mature FMC who could consider both sides of the discussion rather than being fixated on her own viewpoint.",
            "The author's writing style truly impressed me.",
            "The horror elements felt rushed and disconnected from the main narrative. With too many competing themes—romance, writing and publishing tension, and the horror itself—the paranormal aspect appeared muddled and underdeveloped."

        "conclusion": "While I appreciated the plot concept, romance, and writing style, the rushed horror elements and the FMC’s immature behavior detracted from my overall enjoyment. This book is a good choice for fans of contemporary romance with a hint of the paranormal but falls short as a horror novel.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Concept:**  \n  - I liked the idea behind the plot, which revolves around rival writers at a writing retreat in a haunted castle.  \n  - The commentary on the challenges of being an indigenous author in the publishing industry resonated with me, particularly the struggle of having to alter writing to make it more digestible for the masses, even when the original drafts hold more soul.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The concept of the romance was enjoyable and made for a fun read.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - I appreciated Colby's writing style.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  - The horror elements felt rushed and out of place.  \n  - There were too many ideas competing for attention (romance, writing and publishing tension, and the horror story), which made the paranormal element feel muddled and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  - I didn’t love the manipulative characteristics of the female main character (FMC).  \n  - The same conversation between the two main characters was repeated multiple times, with the FMC stubbornly rehashing the same argument despite the male main character (MMC) explaining his perspective.  \n  - The FMC’s behavior, such as blaming the MMC for her career downturn while ignoring her own violent actions (e.g., throwing a book at his head in public), came across as childish and overshadowed her valid points.  \n  - I would have preferred a more mature FMC who could view both sides of the argument rather than being stuck in her own perspective.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  - If you’re looking for a contemporary rivals-to-lovers romance, this is a solid choice.  \n  - If you enjoy slightly spooky books for the fall season or a sprinkle of paranormal, you’ll likely enjoy this book.  \n  - However, if you’re looking for a true horror novel, this likely won’t meet your expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the plot concept, romance, and writing style, the rushed horror elements and the FMC’s immature behavior detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The opening scene, where Pen throws the book, comes across as a bit forced; portraying it as an accident that escalates would have made it feel more believable. Additionally, the repeated comments about Pen's height felt unnecessary and detracted from the narrative. The story follows Pen and Neil, horror authors and friends of Lazslo, as they navigate a haunted castle during a writing retreat. With their careers wobbling after a disastrous panel at a book festival, their initial animosity creates tension. The ghost's backstory and the use of the portrait as a creepy element were effectively executed, enhancing the spooky atmosphere.",
            "I appreciated the representation of Native and bisexual characters in the book, which added depth and inclusivity to the story. However, the romance between Pen and Neil felt a bit rushed for my taste; I prefer a slower build and wished the book had been longer to allow their relationship to develop more fully. I enjoyed Pen's tenacity and her struggles with self-doubt, although some readers might find her annoying. Neil took time to grow on me because of his initially smug attitude, possibly influenced by Pen's perspective. I also wished for more interactions between the main characters and their two friends at the retreat."

            "The story is engaging, but it feels incomplete, especially regarding the ghost subplot. While the resolution of Pen and Neil's relationship is satisfying, the supernatural elements lack depth. The narrative opens with a dramatic confrontation between Pen and Neil at a panel of Native authors, culminating in Pen throwing her book at him. Four months later, struggling with writer's block, Pen is persuaded by her friend Lazlo to attend a writers' retreat in a haunted castle in Scotland. This retreat includes Neil, another Native horror author, and Lazlo, the group's only non-Native member. The tension and intrigue are heightened by the snowstorm trapping them in the haunted castle.",

These elements enrich the narrative while shedding light on critical issues within the literary community."

            "I was pleased to see Penelope and Neil happily settled by the end of the story. I'll certainly be on the lookout for more books from this author! The mystery and history surrounding the castle were enjoyable, and the foreshadowing allowed me to anticipate the plot's direction. I was surprised that Archie Sr. returned, as I had assumed he had perished in the war. However, I wished for a definitive answer regarding Penelope's connection to the family; I assume she is related, given her grey eyes, similar to Georgina's.",
            "I really liked Penelope from the start and enjoyed the opening scene. Neil took some time to win me over; initially, he felt somewhat two-dimensional. However, as Penelope got to know him, his personality emerged. I struggled to connect with Neil at first because his point of view seemed redundant given their frequent interactions, mostly centered around his feelings for Penelope. Laszlo and Daniela were excellent side characters, though I wished they had been more involved in the story. It felt counterproductive that Penelope and Neil had so little opportunity to develop their feelings for each other before she became resistant to acknowledging them. The romance would have benefited from a longer retreat, allowing them to see each other in various situations and challenge their assumptions. A friends-to-lovers dynamic might have also worked better. This is my first read featuring two Native main characters, and I found their struggles with belonging to their tribe very compelling.",

Despite this, I was enthralled by the book.\n\n- **Pacing and Repetitiveness:**  \n  Some parts of the story felt a bit repetitive, but I was so invested in the enemies-to-lovers dynamic that the repetitiveness didn’t bother me much—it was just noticeable.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Pen is an incredibly relatable character. While I am not Native and can’t fully understand her experiences in that regard, her struggles with self-doubt and the need to prove herself resonated deeply with me. Neil was equally multidimensional and realistic. I appreciated that he wasn’t portrayed as a stereotypical muscle-bound hero but rather as someone with a bit of a belly, which felt authentic for an author with a sedentary job.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope was more about a lack of communication and fear of rejection than true animosity. Watching Pen and Neil learn to open up to each other while dealing with literal ghosts was adorable and had me kicking my feet and giggling. The flash-forward 15 months into the future was a sweet touch that added depth to their relationship.\n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The ghost story was creepy enough to keep me on edge but not so terrifying that I had to sleep with the lights on (I’m not a horror fan). I liked that both Pen and Neil independently encountered the ghost before seeing her together, and that her mystery ultimately brought them closer. It was a bit odd that the ghost only wanted to talk to Pen, but it worked within the story. The resolution of the haunting was satisfying and well-executed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI really enjoyed this book! It exceeded my expectations with its blend of relatable characters, a heartwarming romantic arc, and just the right amount of paranormal creepiness. I’ll definitely be reading more from this author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25/5"

Set in a haunted Scottish castle, the novel masterfully blends a cozy yet eerie atmosphere with themes of forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers, and a slow-burn romance between two Indigenous writers. Penelope Skinner, an Indigenous author, attends a writer's retreat to overcome her writer's block, only to find herself sharing the space with Neil Storm, the author responsible for her career setbacks.

However, the pacing falters in the final third, where the characters’ decisions feel inconsistent and illogical, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this novel for its compelling premise, complex characters, and exploration of important themes. However, the final third of the book felt weaker due to inconsistent character decisions, which slightly diminished my overall satisfaction.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I appreciated that both the MMC and FMC were flawed, relatable characters. The author skillfully balanced their personal struggles with the horror and romance plots, ensuring neither overshadowed the other. I was pleasantly surprised by the representation of Native American culture, which the blurb didn’t highlight. While I’m not Native and can’t assess the authenticity of the issues surrounding the protagonists' identities, it felt genuine and truthful to me.",
            "The spicy scenes were well-crafted, though I found myself wishing for more. The slow-burn buildup was satisfying, but I would have liked a bit more payoff. The resolution of the horror elements felt too neat, leading to a “wait, that’s it?!” moment for me at the end. While this could be a personal preference, as I’m not a regular horror reader, I also believe it may be a pacing issue. Most of the horror unfolds in the last third of the book, and I would have appreciated more horror elements introduced earlier on."

The novel is tightly paced, hitting beat after quick beat that seamlessly transitions between romance tropes and horror tropes.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked that both the MMC and FMC were flawed people—real, relatable individuals like the rest of us. Wilkens never let their personal foibles overshadow either the horror or the romance plots, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  The blurb completely buries the lede on the Native American representation, so it was a happy surprise. While I’m not Native myself and can’t speak to the authenticity or accuracy of the issues she writes about regarding the protagonists' identities, it seemed authentic and truthful from my perspective.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The spicy scenes were well-written, though I personally wished there had been more. The slow-burn buildup was satisfying and worth it, but I would have enjoyed a bit more payoff.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  I felt the horror aspect was too easily and neatly wrapped up. Toward the end, I had a “wait, that’s it?!” moment. This could be a personal issue since I’m not a regular horror reader, but I also think it might be a pacing issue. Most of the horror plot is concentrated in the last half to a third of the book, and I would have appreciated more horror elements earlier on.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I really enjoyed this novel, and it will be a perfect, refreshing October recommendation among all the other paranormal romances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues with the horror plot and a desire for more spicy scenes, *If I Stopped Haunting You* is a brilliantly executed horror/romance mashup with well-developed characters and meaningful representation.

I can relate when you’re seen as “not _____ enough.” Not trying to get deep or anything, but I felt that those perspectives were pretty realistic and relatable. Even Neil’s perspective of losing sight of his own work. The industry/audience has a lot of influence, and sometimes you start to change without realizing it.  \n- **Personal Touch:**  \n  And side note: Cute tie-in with the dedication.  \n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley for providing an arc in exchange for my honest opinion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite mixed reviews, I found this novel enjoyable and relatable, with strong tension and themes of personal growth. The characters, while immature, had room for development, and the story resonated with me on a personal level.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their growing understanding of each other deepens their connection, making their romance compelling and believable.  \n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The hauntings in the castle are introduced in creepy and engaging ways, such as cold fingers grazing necks, whispered names, and Pen's compulsion to explore the forbidden west wing. These elements add mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader invested in uncovering the secrets of the trapped spirits.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel explores the challenges faced by Indigenous writers in traditional publishing, highlighting the industry's tendency to whitewash or stereotype their stories. It also emphasizes the importance of staying true to one's authentic voice, as seen through Pen and Neil's struggles and growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*If I Stopped Haunting You* is a captivating blend of romance and paranormal mystery, perfect for fans of the enemies-to-lovers trope who enjoy a touch of spookiness. The novel's exploration of Indigenous representation in publishing adds depth to the story, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The book was by turns funny, romantic, and poignant. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I’m glad I gave it a chance.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  I struggle to describe the central relationship without sounding generic, but Neil and Pen were truly compelling.

They had great chemistry and were good together.\n\n- **Influences and Comparisons:**  \n  While Mike Flanagan’s *The Haunting of Hill House* is name-dropped in the book, the storyline more closely resembles *The Haunting of Bly Manor*. It’s not derivative but feels like a nice nod to the series, with shades of Henry James showing through.\n\n- **Themes and Ambition:**  \n  The book’s scope is ambitious—it’s an enemies-to-lovers romance, a gothic horror, and a statement about the limited opportunities for Native authors in the publishing industry. It accomplishes these elements reasonably well, though I would have appreciated more time spent on Georgina and Archie’s story and a slower transition from enemies to lovers for Neil and Pen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a unique and ambitious blend of genres, with strong character dynamics and a compelling central relationship.

I really like the concept of a bit of romance and some ghost story vibes. The haunted house concept is great, and the plot was well thought out and worked. However, I would not categorize this as horror in the least. It reminded me of a cozy mystery with hauntings and sexy times.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The female lead character was really kind of a jerk. While her initial anger at Neil could’ve been justified, she did not articulate it to him at all. It was a burst from nowhere, as there was not any in-depth backstory. She was also a little wishy-washy when deciding between her anger and lust. The other two supporting characters really did not impact the book other than some comic relief. They were not memorable characters.\n\n- **Romance Execution:**  \n  The building romance started rather abruptly after the female lead had so much anger towards Neil, which was odd. Some of the romance pieces appeared at weird times in the story, like when they were supposed to be haunted but instead got hot and heavy. It felt kind of odd, though there were quite a few romantic moments, which I enjoyed.\n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**  \n  There was lots of repetition in spots, which detracted from the flow of the story. Some parts of the story just didn’t jive well together.\n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Overall, I did like the story as it is entertaining and different. There are plenty of entertaining parts for a well-rounded good story. With some tweaks, I think this could’ve been a 4-5 star read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*If I Stopped Haunting You* is an entertaining blend of romance and ghost story elements, though it falls short of being a true horror novel. While the concept and plot are well thought out, the execution of character development and romance pacing could be improved. Despite its flaws, the story offers a unique and enjoyable reading experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nWith some tweaks, this could’ve been a 4-5 star read.  \n\n*I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

            "The story centers on four horror authors attending a writer's retreat at a supposedly haunted Scottish castle. However, two of the authors feel almost irrelevant to the plot. Penelope and Neil uncover the reality of the haunting and must navigate their writer's block, address the ghostly presence, and manage their romantic tension.

Their dynamic is engaging, but the other two writers often feel extraneous throughout the story. While I don't believe Pen and Neil's Native identities were as essential to the plot as suggested, I still appreciate their representation. As a member of a racial and ethnic minority, I value seeing myself reflected in literature, especially in a narrative that doesn't center on racial trauma."

The romance definitely outweighs the horror here, and that’s okay.  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows a group of four horror authors, two of whom might as well not even be in the story, as they go to a Scottish castle reputed to be haunted for a writer’s retreat. Penelope and Neil discover that the haunting is real, and they have to balance breaking through their writer’s block, fixing the ghost problem, and their romantic tension. I read it in two sittings, so it’s a fun, fast-paced read.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  Penelope and Neil have a contentious relationship (read: repressed longing/lust, and also she threw a book at him at a convention). Their dynamic is engaging, though the other two writers feel lost or extraneous for most of the book, which isn’t great.  \n- **Representation:**  \n  I don’t feel like Pen and Neil’s Native identities were as strictly necessary as they’re billed as. But as a racial and ethnic minority myself, I still love that that piece was there, because there’s nothing like actually seeing yourself represented on the page, especially in a book that isn’t about racial trauma.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This is a nice, cozy read. The balance isn’t always right, but if you just want an escape, this is a very good bet.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the balance between horror and romance isn’t perfect, and some characters feel underutilized, the book is a fun, engaging escape with strong romantic tension and meaningful representation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The haunting elements are both enjoyable and well-executed.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Setting:**  \n  - A slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance between two horror writers set in a haunted castle in Scotland.  \n  - The mixture of romance and horror was great.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - I really liked both main characters (Pen and Neil).  \n  - Their backstory added depth to their relationship.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  - Enjoyed following Pen and Neil as they tried to uncover the truth about the Woman in Black while navigating their feelings for each other.  \n  - Felt a little let down by the conclusion to the ghost story; I was hoping for something more sinister.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance developed quickly, literally in a day, but the spice was good.  \n\n- **Representation:**  \n  - Would recommend this to anyone looking for Indigenous representation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and spooky story with a unique premise and engaging characters. While the ghost story’s conclusion felt underwhelming, the blend of romance and horror, along with the representation, made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\nThank you to St. Martin’s Press for the ARC!"

            "The story opens with a humorous altercation between two horror authors at a book event, instantly capturing my attention. However, after this engaging start, the pacing slows considerably, leading to moments of boredom. While there isn’t unnecessary filler, the narrative drags, making it hard to stay engaged. The ghost scenes come off as so campy that they lose their impact, which I assume was intentional. Although the writing itself is solid, the story ultimately lacks the depth to be truly memorable.",
            "The characters, Penelope and Neil, are intentionally absurd, contributing to a campy tone reminiscent of *Scooby Doo*. However, I found it difficult to engage with them or their romance, which felt shallow and uninteresting.",
            "Initially, I approached the book with reservations due to mixed reviews, but I found myself enjoying it more than anticipated. While I understand why some readers may have negative opinions—given the book's flaws—it still managed to entertain me. The premise intrigued me, reminiscent of a Tim Burton creation: ghosts in a haunted Scottish setting, infused with a silly, campy tone rather than genuine scares. I appreciated the unique blend of ghosts and romance, a combination I haven't encountered often, though it leaned more towards romance than horror."

However, it wasn’t a true genre blend since it leaned more into romance than horror.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story started strong with a humorous fight between two horror authors at a book event, which immediately grabbed my attention.  \n  - However, after the strong start, the pacing slowed down significantly, and I found myself getting bored. It wasn’t filled with unnecessary filler, but it moved too slowly to hold my interest.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  - The characters, Penelope and Neil, were intentionally ridiculous, which I interpreted as part of the campy tone, similar to something like *Scooby Doo*.  \n  - Unfortunately, I couldn’t bring myself to care about the characters or their romance, which felt uninteresting and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Tone and Execution:**  \n  - The ghost scenes were so campy that I couldn’t take them seriously, which I believe was intentional.  \n  - While the book wasn’t badly written, the story itself didn’t captivate me enough to make it memorable.  \n\n- **Expectations and Reception:**  \n  - I had reservations going into the book because of mixed reviews, but I ended up enjoying it more than I expected.  \n  - I understand why some readers might have negative opinions, as the book has its flaws, but it still managed to entertain me to some extent.  \n\n- **Desire for Genre Innovation:**  \n  - This book sparked a desire for a genuinely scary horror novel with a strong romance subplot. I’d love to see someone combine the two genres effectively, creating a story that’s both terrifying and emotionally engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a promising start and a unique, campy tone, it ultimately fell short due to slow pacing and unengaging characters.

I found it difficult to connect with Pen, the female main character, particularly in her treatment of Neil during the early chapters. Her verbal and physical aggression crossed a line for me, and the rapid shift from animosity to love felt jarring and unrealistic. It raises questions about how a relationship can thrive when it begins with violence. \n\nOn a positive note, the story does feature some steamy scenes, and the chemistry between Pen and Neil is palpable, whether they're bickering or expressing affection. The secondary characters added a fun dynamic, and I enjoyed their banter and collaborative writing tasks. Overall, while there were elements I appreciated, the central relationship left me wanting more.",

I didn't really like Pen, the FMC, and the way she treats Neil, especially in the first chapters of the book. The way she verbally and physically assaulted him went too far. Plus, their relationship went too quickly from total hatred to love with a rather abrupt transition. It didn't make sense to me. And how does the relationship continue when it begins with violence? That being said, they do have some pretty sexy scenes, and their chemistry is strong. Whether they are bickering with each other or loving on each other, you can tell there are strong feelings between them.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Going to a haunted Scottish castle on a writing retreat sounds amazing, and it's a wonderful backdrop for the story. I think it's my favorite part of the novel, and the author definitely created a vivid setting.\n\n- **Secondary Characters and Interactions:**  \n  The secondary characters were fun and had some great banter.

Neil's passive acceptance of her insults and his self-hatred can be frustrating, though his awkwardness and appreciation for Pen add a touch of charm. While Pen's transformation into a more likable and responsible character by the story's end is rewarding, it sometimes feels overly dramatic. Daniela, on the other hand, is portrayed as excessively antagonistic, which comes across as over-the-top and unnecessary.",

            "The secondary characters lacked depth and failed to enhance the story. Despite the dual point of view, I struggled to differentiate the main characters' voices, often confusing whose perspective I was reading. Both the romance and horror elements felt underdeveloped; I experienced neither fear nor the thrill of new love. The transition from enemies to lovers seemed abrupt given their complicated history, and sudden shifts—like moving from encountering a ghost to seeking intimacy—were hard to follow.",
            "Both main characters in the novel have indigenous heritage, though only one possesses a tribal card. The book thoughtfully addresses the absence of native voices in publishing, the representation of indigenous people in media, and the pressure on underrepresented writers to fit a “perfect” minority image. These themes are elegantly explored and raise valid concerns, such as the need to “tone down” work for broader appeal.\n\nAs someone with limited familiarity with tribal identity politics, I found the subplot engaging and felt inspired to conduct further research. However, the novel fails to clarify that the character without a tribal card cannot legally claim a native identity—a significant point to consider.\n\nIt’s also important to mention that the author’s identity has faced scrutiny in the media, prompting her to alter her biography. While her identity is not the focus of my reading experience, I hope her publisher will outline strategies to uplift stories from those who politically identify as native in the future.",

The mysterious aspect of the castle interacting with its occupants was my favorite part of the book, giving it a Scooby Doo-like vibe that I enjoyed.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book didn’t feel like horror; instead, it was more intriguing than scary. While I appreciated the lack of fear, I expected a stronger balance between the spooky and romantic elements, which felt uneven.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  The connection between Neil and Pen fell flat for me. Pen’s misplaced anger and bitterness toward Neil made their enemies-to-lovers dynamic feel sad rather than engaging. While there was physical attraction, the emotional connection was lacking, making it hard to believe Neil would want to give her a second chance.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The attempt to address inequalities in the publishing industry, particularly concerning indigenous peoples, was commendable. However, the message was overshadowed by Pen’s inability to control her actions, which detracted from its impact.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Potential:**  \n  Despite my reservations about this book, I believe the author has a strong writing future ahead and would be willing to read her next work.  \n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  Kyla Garcia’s narration as Pen was excellent, and I enjoyed her delivery. Curtis Michael Holland’s performance as Neil was fine, but I wasn’t as impressed with his voices for the supporting characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and mysterious elements of the book were engaging, the romance and character dynamics fell short for me.

In contrast, Neil's patient and reserved demeanor, though initially unremarkable, highlighted Penelope's fiery personality. His admiration for her work suggested deeper layers, and I found myself eager for his development, hoping he would stand up to her confrontations.

The idea of a haunted castle author’s retreat was fun, but again, it didn’t fully deliver.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance felt rushed and was purely based on lust.

The group also attempts to uncover the mysteries of a castle with a centuries-old history.  \n- **Pacing:** The ending of the novel feels overly drawn out, which detracts from the overall experience.  \n- **Tone and Atmosphere:** The book has a light, cute vibe that makes it suitable for a Halloween read.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:** The novel is neither exceptionally good nor bad; it falls squarely in the middle, offering a decent but unremarkable reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel blends elements of mystery and romance with a touch of humor, making it a lighthearted Halloween read. While the concept is engaging and the atmosphere is charming, the pacing issues, particularly the dragging ending, prevent it from standing out. It’s a middle-of-the-road story that’s enjoyable but forgettable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"

This isn’t typically a genre I’m drawn to or choose to read, so that influenced my perspective on the story.\n\n- **Romantic Trope and Relationship Development:**  \n  I love a good enemies-to-lovers trope, and I felt this one had a mature evolution into a relationship. The forced proximity, combined with the terrifying ghosts, created an interesting dynamic for the characters to talk about their feelings and examine prejudice.\n\n- **Ghost Storyline and Plot Strength:**  \n  The actual ghost storyline wasn’t my favorite, which brought down my rating a bit. I wanted a stronger reason for why Georgina haunted the castle so aggressively. I felt the reasoning behind her actions could have been more compelling.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for the opportunity to read this novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was intriguing and the enemies-to-lovers trope was well-executed, the ghost storyline fell short for me due to its lack of depth. The creepiness of the story was unexpected and not entirely to my taste, but the mature relationship development was a highlight.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "I found the character of Neil compelling, likely inspired by a notable Native/Indigenous horror writer. However, I was left unsatisfied with Georgina’s arc. Despite her happy ending in life, her choice to remain a ghost felt inconsistent and raised questions about her character's development.",

Although the book primarily focuses on romance, I believe the setting could have been further developed to enrich the story.

This commitment to authenticity adds depth and significance to the narrative.",

            "**Penelope Skinner:** Pen emerges as the novel's most compelling protagonist, grappling with her passion for storytelling while challenging harmful literary stereotypes. Her journey from righteous anger to romantic interest in Neil, however, occasionally feels rushed. **Neil Storm:** Neil's character arc presents more challenges. His struggle to balance artistic integrity with commercial success is intriguing, yet his development often lacks consistency. The swift shift from adversary to potential love interest strains credibility. The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Pen and Neil serves as the heart of the romantic plot, and while the initial tension is well-captured, the pacing of their relationship feels uneven. The transition from hostility to physical desire occurs abruptly, with some intimate moments appearing more driven by plot necessity than by authentic character growth.",
            "The author excels in descriptive prose, masterfully establishing the eerie atmosphere of the castle. However, the novel suffers from inconsistent pacing; some segments drag on while others rush by. Additionally, the balance among the romantic, paranormal, and mystery elements is uneven, resulting in a disjointed narrative experience.",
            "The author masterfully creates an evocative backdrop for the story. The castle, with its narrow passageways, forbidden wings, and centuries-old secrets, becomes a character in its own right. The mist-shrouded grounds, flickering candles, and eerie nighttime sounds effectively cultivate a pervasive sense of unease throughout the narrative.",
            "**Indigenous Voices in Publishing:** This novel effectively highlights the challenges Indigenous authors encounter in the publishing industry. Through the contrasting storytelling approaches of Pen and Neil, Wilkens raises critical questions about authenticity, cultural responsibility, and the pressures of market demands. **Artistic Integrity vs. Commercial Success:** The struggle to balance artistic vision with the expectations of publishers and readers is a central theme. Both characters navigate this dilemma in unique ways, providing readers with insight into the complexities of the publishing landscape."

        "conclusion": "If I Stopped Haunting You is a promising but uneven debut that showcases the author's potential as a voice in paranormal romance. While the novel doesn't fully capitalize on its intriguing premise, readers will find value in its atmospheric setting, discussions of Indigenous representation in literature, and moments of genuine romantic tension. Those who enjoy their love stories with a spectral twist may find enough here to satisfy, but readers seeking a more cohesive blend of romance and supernatural suspense may be left wanting.",

The castle, with its cramped passageways, forbidden wings, and centuries of secrets, becomes a character in its own right. The descriptions of mist-shrouded grounds, flickering candles, and inexplicable sounds in the night effectively build a sense of unease that permeates the narrative.\n\n- **Characters:**\n  - **Penelope Skinner:** Pen emerges as the novel's more compelling protagonist. Her struggle to reconcile her passion for storytelling with her desire to challenge harmful stereotypes in literature feels authentic and timely. However, her journey from righteous anger to romantic interest in Neil occasionally feels rushed.\n  - **Neil Storm:** Neil's character arc proves more problematic. His inner conflict over compromising his artistic vision for commercial success is interesting, but his development often comes across as inconsistent. His quick transition from adversary to potential love interest strains credibility.\n\n- **Romance:**\n  - The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Pen and Neil forms the core of the novel's romantic plotline. Wilkens captures the initial tension well, but the pacing of their romantic development feels uneven. The shift from hostility to physical desire happens rather abruptly, with some intimate encounters feeling more driven by plot necessity than organic character growth.\n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**\n  - The supernatural elements are where the novel struggles most to find its footing. The initial build-up of spectral activity is promising, but as the ghostly encounters escalate, they begin to feel more like interruptions to the central romance rather than an integral part of the story. The resolution of the historical mystery feels rushed and somewhat disconnected from the main characters' journeys.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**\n  - **Indigenous Voices in Publishing:** The novel's strengths lie in its exploration of the challenges faced by Indigenous authors in the publishing industry. Through Pen and Neil's conflicting approaches to storytelling, Wilkens raises important questions about authenticity, cultural responsibility, and the pressures of market demands.\n  - **Artistic Integrity vs. Commercial Success:** The tension between staying true to one's artistic vision and meeting the expectations of publishers and readers is a recurring theme. Both Pen and Neil grapple with this dilemma in different ways, offering readers a glimpse into the complex realities of the publishing world.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n  - Wilkens demonstrates a flair for descriptive prose, particularly when it comes to setting the mood and describing the castle's eerie atmosphere. However, the pacing of the novel is inconsistent, with some sections dragging while others feel rushed. The balance between the romantic, paranormal, and mystery elements is not always successful, leading to a sense of narrative whiplash.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"If I Stopped Haunting You\" is a promising but uneven debut that showcases Colby Wilkens's potential as a voice in paranormal romance. While the novel doesn't fully capitalize on its intriguing premise, readers will find value in its atmospheric setting, discussions of Indigenous representation in literature, and moments of genuine romantic tension. Those who enjoy their love stories with a spectral twist may find enough here to satisfy, but readers seeking a more cohesive blend of romance and supernatural suspense may be left wanting.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Strengths: Evocative setting, engaging exploration of Indigenous representation, moments of genuine chemistry.\n- Areas for Improvement: Uneven pacing, underdeveloped supernatural aspects, rushed character development, inconsistent balance between romance and paranormal elements."

            "Set in a haunted castle during a writing retreat, this story effectively combines the themes of writer's block and spooky intrigue. The opening scene, which takes place months before the retreat, establishes Pen's animosity toward Neil, creating immediate tension. However, some moments, such as the rapid development of lust between Pen and Neil, feel rushed; this could be better explained by the haunting intensifying their emotions. The ghostly elements and mystery are engaging, particularly given that the main characters are horror writers.",
            "The main characters, Pen and Neil, are well-developed, with their identities as Native authors and their contrasting experiences significantly shaping the narrative. While Pen's actions may seem immature, they appear influenced by the haunting, suggesting a lack of control. In contrast, the side characters, such as Daniela and Laszlo, lack depth, serving primarily as comic relief or plot devices. Greater development of the other writers at the retreat would have enhanced the story. The narrative focuses on Pen's struggles with identity and belonging as a mixed Indigenous person, and the author authentically represents Native characters without whitewashing, which is commendable.",
            "This novel offers a delightful blend of spooky atmosphere and romantic comedy, featuring ghosts in a cozy, mysterious setting. With elements of enemies-to-lovers, haunted castles, and a touch of spice, it’s an engaging read that perfectly balances romance and intrigue."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a cozy, spooky, and romantic mystery with a unique blend of genres and themes. While the side characters could have been more developed, the main characters and their journey, both romantically and through the haunting, are engaging. The representation of Native identities is authentic and thoughtfully integrated into the story. The audio narration is a standout feature, making it a great choice for audiobook lovers.",

            "The story follows Pen and Neil, initially rivals, who evolve into a romantic couple as they explore the mysteries of a haunted castle. The paranormal elements, particularly the ghosts, enrich the narrative, leaning more towards the supernatural than horror.",
            "**Penelope Pen Skinner** is a biracial horror writer (white and Native American) who grapples with unwarranted anger and jealousy towards her more successful counterpart, **Neil Storm**, an indigenous horror writer. Throughout the story, Pen undergoes a journey of redemption, learning to embrace her own voice. Neil, in turn, discovers the importance of writing from the heart rather than seeking external validation. \n\nThe supporting cast includes Laszlo, a mutual friend and fellow writer; Daniela, a bisexual writer with whom Pen shares a brief romantic encounter; and the ghosts Georgina and Archibald \"Archie\" Skinner, who add depth to the narrative. \n\nThe romance between Pen and Neil is well-crafted, featuring a compelling transition from rivals to lovers that feels both believable and engaging, with a spice level of 4/5.",

The narration was excellent, and the story's themes of authenticity and redemption resonated well. However, the emotional impact and horror elements were somewhat lacking, making it more of a paranormal tale than a true horror story.",

            "The buildup to the ending was disappointing, lacking the depth and creativity I had hoped for. A more thoughtfully crafted conclusion could have elevated this book to a 5-star read. However, I was immediately drawn in by the intriguing plot, which begins with a flashback at a Comic-Con-style event featuring indigenous horror authors. The story follows Penelope Skinner, a passionate yet struggling author, and her arrogant rival, Neil Storm, as they find themselves at a haunted writers' retreat. The vividly described haunted house setting creates a spooky, immersive atmosphere. The premise of four writers attempting to craft a best-selling horror novel in such a setting is engaging, filled with eerie elements like moving paintings, cold rooms, and creepy cellars.",

Ultimately, it’s a book better suited for fans of paranormal fiction than romance readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Paranormal Plot: 4/5  \n- Romance: 2/5  \n- Character Development: 2/5  \n- Themes and Social Commentary: 4/5  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 3/5"

            "The slow-burn romance was captivating and became quite steamy as it reached its peak. The emotional connection between the leads stood out as a highlight of the story. While the romance was the primary focus, it somewhat alleviated my disappointment with the ghost-mystery resolution. The supporting cast featured charming and humorous friends, though one character felt underdeveloped and lacked sufficient page time. Overall, I enjoyed the dynamic among the characters.",

It’s chilling enough to enhance the atmosphere and the emotional (and physical) vulnerability of the two leads as they slowly open up to each other, yet not too disturbing to lose its coziness.  \n  - The ghost-mystery side of the book carried enough suspense and dread for most of the story, though the resolution felt anticlimactic and left me with unanswered questions about the ghosts’ motivations.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The slow-burn romance was engaging and got quite steamy as it climaxed. The emotional connection between the leads was a highlight of the story.  \n  - The romance was the main focus, which offset most of my disappointment with the ghost-mystery resolution.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  - The novel included surprising and insightful commentary on the state of indigenous authors in the book industry.  \n  - While I agreed with the message, I found the execution clumsy, with heavy-handed, didactic dialogue that sometimes clashed with the characters’ voices and lacked the creativity and charm of their banter.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  - The cast included funny, charismatic friend characters, though one of them felt underdeveloped and didn’t get enough page time.  \n  - Overall, I enjoyed the dynamic between the characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Potential:**  \n  - The author is an interesting new voice in the romance/horror sphere, and I’m looking forward to her next book and seeing her further develop as a storyteller.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis cozy adult romance-horror hybrid is a quick, breezy read with an engaging slow-burn romance and a chilling ghost-mystery.

            "The haunted castle subplot felt secondary to the romance and lacked a genuine sense of threat, though it did gain momentum in the second half. While Laszlo's writing exercises were somewhat silly, they effectively advanced the plot. The mutual decision by Penelope and Neil to quit writing if they couldn't overcome their writer's block generated more tension than the supernatural elements. Additionally, the excerpts from fictional texts, including Laszlo's novel, seemed to detract from the overall story.",
            "I appreciated that both Penelope and Neil are Indigenous authors, which adds depth to their characters. Penelope’s struggle with her biracial identity and her fear of not being seen as Native enough resonated with me. Neil’s conflict over accepting edits that clash with his vision underscores his internal struggle with authenticity. The transition from enemies to lovers between Penelope and Neil was engaging, though I found it hard to fully embrace their roles as horror authors. Laszlo and Daniella, the other retreat participants, were delightful additions, especially as they navigated the tension between Penelope and Neil. The inclusion of LGBT+ elements enriched the story, adding valuable diversity.",
            "The dual point of view offered valuable introspection but often felt repetitive, as the characters tended to revisit the same issues. Additionally, the book's structure left little room for Penelope's fluffy black cat, Apawllo, which was disappointing."

            "The haunting's backstory exudes strong gothic vibes, reminiscent of a Regency mystery. The spooky elements strike a balance between playful and genuinely frightening, echoing the tone of Jane Austen's *Northanger Abbey*. The seamless blend of humor, romance, and horror makes the story both engaging and immersive.",

As rival horror authors, their initial misunderstandings give way to a beautifully evolving dynamic. I particularly enjoyed the \"he falls first\" trope and how their relationship deepens amid the haunting and a snowstorm. \n\n**Supporting Characters (Daniela and Laszlo):**  \nDaniela and Laszlo inject humor and drama into the narrative. Laszlo, serious about his writing retreat, clearly values his friends, while Daniela revels in the tension between Neil and Penelope.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Concept:**  \n  The novel features a unique plot about rival writers who end up at the same writers' retreat in a haunted Scottish castle. They team up to solve the mystery of why the ghosts are targeting them. While the concept is intriguing, the execution falls short of its potential.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  The relationship between the protagonists is not a true enemies-to-lovers trope, as they are merely rivals with a disagreement over their shared genre. The male lead is clearly infatuated with the female lead early on, but her feelings come across as more lust-driven than emotional. Their chemistry is present but lacks depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  The book is a quick, chill read that doesn’t demand much from the reader. It’s not complex or scary, which might disappoint those expecting a more intense ghost story. However, it’s enjoyable for a light, fun experience.  \n\n- **Smut/Intimacy:**  \n  The intimate scenes are frequent and lust-driven, often catching the reader off guard. While they add a layer of passion to the story, they sometimes feel out of place given the haunted setting.  \n\n- **Horror Element:**  \n  The ghost story aspect is underwhelming and not scary, even for someone sensitive to horror. It’s unclear if the author intended it to be frightening, but the lack of a strong horror component makes this element feel lackluster.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is still enjoyable. It’s a quick, fun read with a cute concept that doesn’t require deep analysis or harsh criticism.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a unique and lighthearted take on a haunted castle story with a romantic twist. While the execution of the plot and horror elements could have been stronger, it’s an enjoyable, quick read for those seeking something fun and unchallenging.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The mix of horror, paranormal, mystery, and romance vibes was intriguing and had a lot of potential.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt shallow and not fully fleshed out. Their inner monologues were repetitive, and the dynamic between the two main characters, who were supposed to be enemies, lacked the expected conflict. Instead of a gradual build-up of tension, there was an instant attraction, which made their relationship less compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot lacked clarity in terms of stakes—it was unclear what would happen if the mystery wasn’t solved. The ending felt abrupt, and there wasn’t a strong driving force compelling the characters to solve the mystery. More spooky scenes and a stronger motive would have improved the story.\n\n- **Genre Balance:**  \n  While I enjoyed the mix of genres, I felt the balance was off. The book leaned too heavily into lustful thoughts rather than building tension or delivering more horror elements. As someone who usually avoids horror, I surprisingly wanted more spooky scenes.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Potential:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I liked the book enough to keep an eye on the author’s future works. I’m curious to see how her writing style evolves. I appreciated the opportunity to read this ARC through NetGalley and the publisher.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a strong concept and an interesting mix of genres, but it fell short in character development, plot execution, and genre balance.

The complexity of the narrative, coupled with an abundance of characters involved in the haunting, detracts from the overall experience. It seems that only the two main characters are essential to the haunting, while the backstories of others feel excessive and unnecessary.

I found the main characters engaging, though Penelope's resentment towards Neil and his writing felt somewhat superficial. Throughout her internal monologues, she often concludes that her feelings stem from jealousy, but she never fully explores this. I appreciated her eventual decision to read Neil's original book, which empowers him to fight against the industry's racist ideals. However, I found Daniela's character annoying and unnecessary; her subplot about writing a book on Penelope and Neil added little to the main narrative.

The story is a bit too complicated, with many characters in the haunting who don’t all serve a purpose.

During her internal monologues, she often talks herself into just being jealous of Neil. However, I’m glad she eventually reads his original book and helps him see that he can fight for what he wants to be published without the industry imposing their racist ideals on it.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between Penelope and Neil is pretty well resolved.

The haunted, secluded castle in Scotland had the perfect dark, almost gothic vibes that I love in a ghost story.  \n\n- **Ghost Story Elements:**  \n  I really liked the ghost story part of the book. The scene where the two characters go to the basement and see the ghost for the first time was so intense that I think I may still have nightmares about it. I thought this storyline was really good.  \n\n- **Main Character (Penelope):**  \n  I pretty much hated the main character, Penelope. I couldn’t stand how she treated Neil; she came across as petty, mean, jealous, and rude most of the time. I just couldn’t understand her hatred of Neil. The enemies-to-lovers trope in this book felt super forced and contrived. She really had no reason to hate him, and I had a hard time with the chapters that were in her point of view.  \n\n- **Secondary Character (Neil):**  \n  I did like Neil. I found his character relatable, especially his struggles with giving up his true story to his publisher for one that is more \"saleable.\" This idea of selling out to be successful and how he coped with it felt very real and relevant.  \n\n- **Secondary Character (Daniella):**  \n  The character I loved the most was Daniella. Her constant betting and her over-the-top, amazing personality were highlights for me. The scene where they interrupt her on her FaceTime call may live rent-free in my brain for a while.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**  \n  Overall, there were lots of good things about the book, but I felt it was a little all over the place. It was a spicy, paranormal story with intense scary scenes, laugh-out-loud funny moments, and some deeper themes about life and love. However, the mix of tones made it feel a bit disjointed.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance felt a little forced, and the characters were a little weak in this aspect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I loved the setting, the ghost story, and the gothic vibes, the romance felt forced, and some characters were weaker than others. It’s not a bad read for a rainy autumn afternoon, but it could have been more cohesive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The romance between Neil and Pen felt underdeveloped. While I appreciated their complexity and shared history, the story didn't fully explore their individual or collective pasts, making their sudden romantic shift less believable. Their chemistry was decent, but the pacing of their relationship and the rapid transition into intimacy felt rushed and less convincing than the supernatural elements. I appreciated the Native representation and the exploration of identity politics, especially given the author's biracial background (white/Native American). However, I believe this aspect could have been handled with greater nuance.",

While it leaned more heavily into horror than I anticipated or preferred, it remained entertaining and concluded nicely. This book is perfect for readers who enjoy stories that are more scary than spooky and appreciate the enemies-to-lovers trope. Its release timing is ideal for this type of story."

            "The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Penelope and Neil felt resolved too quickly, leaving me wishing for a longer buildup of tension. Their relationship seemed rushed and, at times, bordering on abusive, as Penelope physically and emotionally assaults Neil while blaming him for her actions. I struggled to connect with Penelope; she came across as immature and annoying, showing little growth by the end. Neil was more intriguing but also lacked significant character development. In contrast, the supporting characters, Lazlo and Daniela, were entertaining and added depth to the story. Lazlo maintained order during the retreat and organized writing activities, while Daniela brought a cheeky, mischievous energy that was refreshing.",

Penelope comes off as selfish and angry, whereas Neil is a misunderstood pushover. I didn’t love either of the characters, but Neil was more enjoyable than Penelope. Regardless, I enjoyed how things developed between them.  \n\n- **Narrative Elements (Excerpts from Penelope’s Book):**  \n  I wasn’t really into the excerpts from Penelope’s book; they didn’t add to the story and just felt like filler. There is a tiny link between her book and Neil’s tattoo, but not enough to where it needs to be more than referenced during a conversation between characters.  \n\n- **Horror Aspect:**  \n  The biggest disappointment of this novel was the horror aspect. It felt like a missed opportunity. The ending lost the book a fourth star. The big reveal the entire story built up to wasn’t much of a reveal at all. The reason for the haunting didn’t make sense. The scenes were crafted well in the moments of horror, but the backstory was the issue. It felt like the story behind the ghosts was a second thought. The first 3/4ths of the book painted a tragedy (and I was hooked), but the reader is left with a haunting from a societal norm of the time period.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  If you read this, read it for the romance, not the horror.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong premise and enjoyable slow-burn romance, the horror aspect fell flat, particularly due to the underwhelming backstory and ending.

Thankfully, the pacing improved in the second half, where things started moving more quickly.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  This is a debut novel, so the uneven writing and pacing issues might be growing pains for the author. There’s promise in the story, and I appreciated that the main characters evolved to be supportive rather than adversarial by the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and concept are strong, the execution fell short for me. The characters were hard to connect with, the narrative felt uneven, and the pacing was slow in the beginning. However, there’s potential in the author’s storytelling, and I hope to see growth in future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

One of the main characters’ self-description of not feeling “native enough” resonated with me personally.\n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The inclusion of two additional authors, Daniella and another unnamed character, felt unnecessary. They didn’t contribute meaningfully to the plot and often detracted from the story. Their presence, especially at inconvenient times, added confusion, particularly since Neil and Penelope were sometimes referred to by only their first or last names.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The haunting element was too simplistic and didn’t make much sense by the end. The retreat setting, involving all four authors, didn’t effectively advance the plot. It would have been more impactful if Neil and Penelope were sent by their PR teams or publishers to publicly reconcile after the BookCon incident, rather than being part of a retreat that felt irrelevant.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I enjoyed the quick, light read, but the story wasn’t memorable enough for me to revisit it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some enjoyable elements, such as the relatable character dynamics and the light romance, it was hindered by unnecessary supporting characters, a weak haunting plotline, and a retreat setting that didn’t serve the story well.

However, she engages in self-reflection throughout the story and eventually recognizes the true roots of her anger. I believe her character arc would have been stronger if her feelings towards Neil had been explored earlier. Despite her initial flaws, I appreciated how the story concluded. Both Neil and Penelope experience significant growth, emerging as better individuals. Their relationship evolves meaningfully, even if it starts off on a rocky note.",

While I understand the importance of background information and context, I’m not sure how much of that first section actually contributed to the rest of the story.\n\n- **Character Development (Penelope):**  \n  I found Penelope to be incredibly frustrating early on. While she has valid reasons to be upset by the status quo, she doesn’t handle things appropriately. Her early actions towards Neil felt excessive and misplaced. However, she does engage in self-reflection throughout the story and eventually acknowledges the true roots of her anger. I think her character arc could have been more effective if her anger towards Neil had been examined earlier.\n\n- **Romance and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  Despite Penelope’s initial flaws, I liked how everything wrapped up. Both Neil and Penelope undergo significant growth and come out of the story better than they went in. Their relationship progresses in a way that feels meaningful, even if it starts off rocky.\n\n- **Genre Expectations and Supernatural Elements:**  \n  This book may not satisfy traditional horror readers, as the supernatural elements are never fully explained. However, I see these elements as tools to facilitate and support the romance rather than being the focus of the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite some flaws and its unconventional approach to the genre, I ended up enjoying the book more than I initially expected to.

The repetitive writing, awkward sexual language, and lack of chemistry between the leads left me wanting more. However, fans of cozy, atmospheric romances with a touch of the supernatural may still find it enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the intriguing characters and their backgrounds, especially the male main character—he was fantastic! I would love to see more of him in the future. However, I felt the relationship development between Penelope and Neil was lacking. While it's clear they have a history, we only get a glimpse of it during the scene where she throws a book at him. Additionally, the female main character physically assaults the male lead multiple times. Although some of these moments are intended to be humorous, her lack of remorse made it fall flat for me.",

Despite my minor critique about the romantic elements, I would gladly read additional works by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I liked the enemies-to-lovers trope in itself, I wasn’t satisfied with how it developed.\n\n- **Mystery and Horror Elements:**  \n  The mystery and horror aspects of the story were the most intriguing parts for me. However, I felt the romance often outweighed the horror elements, causing the latter to get lost. There were several scenes where the characters encountered ghosts, but then they inexplicably got horny right after they disappeared, which I couldn’t comprehend.\n\n- **Backstory and World-Building:**  \n  The reason for the ghosts haunting the castle was also lacking, in my opinion.

The characters were well-developed, and the story kept me engaged with its surprises and emotional depth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While the ending provided some redemption, the romance aspect, which is central to the story, left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The second half was more interesting as they investigated the castle and learned more about its former inhabitants.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I didn’t really buy into Penelope and Neil being enemies since their dislike for each other didn’t seem to last long. I also didn’t feel the chemistry between them.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  I did love the detailed descriptions of the castle. It made the book more atmospheric and spooky, which I liked.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The spicier scenes took me out of the book and felt rather abrupt. One page it would be talking about the characters interacting with the ghosts, and the next they were making out.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  I was hoping the reveal would be more interesting, but it kind of let me down.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had an intriguing premise and a well-described, atmospheric setting, but it fell short in terms of pacing, character chemistry, and plot resolution. While the second half was more engaging, the abrupt romantic scenes and underwhelming reveal left me feeling that the book was just okay.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

She blamed others for things that were very obviously her own fault. Additionally, she was unnecessarily violent.  \n\n- **Character Development (Neil):**  \n  I liked Neil enough, but I wasn’t sold on their romance.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  I usually enjoy enemies-to-lovers and forced proximity tropes, but in this case, the romance felt abrupt and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  I enjoyed the mystery part, particularly the haunting, which was introduced in the last 40% of the book. I think if this element had been intertwined throughout the entire story, it would have enhanced my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  If the romance had been better developed, Pen had been more likable, and the mystery had been integrated earlier, I would have enjoyed the book much more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the book’s important message about representation and opportunities for indigenous and BIPOC writers, I found the execution lacking in several areas.

While the first half was somewhat enjoyable, the overall experience was a challenge.\n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  Many of the characters were unlikeable, and the audiobook narration exacerbated this issue. Their personalities made it difficult for me to connect with or root for them.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book included political discussions that often pulled me out of the story, disrupting the flow. However, I appreciated the thoughtful conversations about Native American culture, authors, and the complexities of cultural identity.\n\n- **Writing and Plotting:**  \n  The book is well-written and well-plotted, with some genuinely funny banter that added moments of levity. Despite my struggles, I recognize the author’s skill in crafting the narrative.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I believe this book has an audience, but it’s not for me. While it has merit, it didn’t resonate with my personal preferences.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book is well-crafted with strong writing and plotting, I found it difficult to engage with due to unlikeable characters and disruptive political themes. The discussions about Native American culture were a highlight, but overall, the book didn’t align with my tastes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The forced proximity of the writing retreat provided a great opportunity for their relationship, but it fell short in delivering the necessary tension and development.\n  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wasn’t invested in Penelope and Neil as individuals or as a couple. Their characters felt underdeveloped, which made it hard for me to connect with them emotionally.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the initial setup of their rivalry was clear, the story lacked the buildup and banter that I expected. The pacing felt off, and the relationship progression didn’t feel as satisfying as it could have been.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, while the premise had potential, the execution fell short in delivering the emotional depth and character development needed to fully engage me in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For instance, the inclusion of discussions about colonizers felt out of place in what appeared to be a romance or YA novel.\n\n- **Plot Coherence:**  \n  Many elements of the plot didn’t make sense to me. The premise of authors arguing in a group felt disjointed, and the setting—whether a writers' retreat or a haunted castle—was unclear.

The author demonstrated skill in crafting sentences and maintaining a readable style, which is a positive aspect of the book.\n\n- **Appropriateness for Target Audience:**  \n  If the book is intended as a YA novel, the inclusion of steamy content felt inappropriate for that audience. This mismatch further added to the confusion about the book’s intended genre and audience.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment vs. Objective Evaluation:**  \n  While I found the book challenging to enjoy due to its lack of focus, I tried to judge it objectively based on what it aimed to be rather than solely on my personal preferences. This effort highlights the complexity of rating such a multifaceted book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a challenging read due to its unclear genre, incoherent plot, and mismatched themes.

The discussion of Penelope’s struggles with not feeling \"Native enough\" due to her fair skin and lack of tribal enrollment resonated deeply with me. It’s a very real issue that many of us face, and I appreciated how the book addressed it, along with the broader issue of whitewashing Native stories or making them more palatable for a white audience. Overall, the exploration of social and cultural issues was well done.\n\n- **Character Development and Accountability:**\n  - I appreciated Neil’s acknowledgment that he hadn’t stood up for himself or his community enough and his desire to do better in the future. However, I was disappointed that Penelope never fully apologized for physically assaulting him at a public panel. While she apologized for hating him and not understanding his perspective, she never addressed the scar she caused or expressed a desire to grow and do better. This lack of accountability made her character feel less redeemed and left me wanting more growth from her.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n  - The haunted castle setting and the overall plot were intriguing, but I felt the resolution was a bit underwhelming. The characters made a lot of assumptions, and I wished for more concrete clues. Instead, the ghosts simply revealed everything, leaving the question of Penelope’s potential relation to them unresolved. This made the ending feel a bit flat.\n\n- **Character Depth and Emotional Range:**\n  - While I enjoyed the book, I felt the characters lacked depth outside of their anger or romantic tension. I would have liked to see more complexity in their personalities and emotions. That said, I’m really rooting for Colby and plan to reread the book once it’s published to see the final version.\n\n- **Potential and Future Expectations:**\n  - Despite some shortcomings, I see great potential in the author’s writing. First books are always challenging, and I’m excited to read the next installment in the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I had fun reading *If I Stopped Haunting You* and appreciated its focus on Native and queer representation, as well as its exploration of cultural issues.

            "This horror romance expertly balances spooky and sexy elements. As someone who is easily frightened, I appreciated how the intimate scenes and resolution alleviated the tension. The story follows Penelope and Neil, rival Native horror authors, who are lured to a haunted castle for a writer’s retreat. The castle's genuine hauntings force them to confront their personal and professional issues while unraveling the ghost's mystery. The forbidden door in the west wing adds an intriguing twist to the plot. The enemies-to-lovers and forced proximity tropes are well-executed, and the atmospheric setting of the haunted castle enhances the overall experience.",
            "Penelope and Neil are intricately crafted characters with compelling backstories. Penelope, a one-hit-wonder author, grapples with her identity and career, while Neil, a popular writer, faces accusations of perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Their relationship is marked by tension, but as they confront their issues and acknowledge their feelings, it deepens. I appreciated that their conflicts remained unresolved, reflecting the complexity of their characters. Their banter, particularly Neil’s humorous comment about having sex in a haunted castle, added a lighthearted touch to the narrative.\n\nInitially, I loved this book, but I recently discovered that the Tribal Association Against Fraud has investigated the author for misrepresenting their Native identity. Given that Native identity is central to the story, if this report is accurate, the narrative may not be the author's to tell. While I’m not Indigenous or Native, I found the themes of representation and identity thought-provoking. Penelope’s struggle with her mixed-race identity and lack of tribal documentation enriched her character, while Neil’s internal conflict about writing for the white gaze versus his own truth was compelling. For more context, this blogger provides an insightful explainer: [link].",
            "This debut impresses with a writing style that seamlessly blends humor, romance, and horror. The jump scares are effective, while the lighter moments provide a nice balance to the spooky atmosphere. The dialogue feels natural, and the pacing keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. I also came to appreciate the Jennifer Prince cover, which I initially overlooked but now find captivating."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Authenticity and Representation:**  \n  I loved this book initially, but I recently learned that the Tribal Association Against Fraud has investigated and found that the author is not actually Native. Native identity is a core part of this book, and if this report is true, this story is not Wilkens' to tell. I don’t know much about the situation, but this blogger has an explainer: [link]. As a POC (though not Indigenous or Native), I found the tension around representation and identity in the story to be thought-provoking and worthy of exploration. Penelope’s struggle with her mixed-race identity and lack of tribal documentation added depth to her character, while Neil’s internal conflict about writing for the white gaze versus his truth was compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n  This is a horror romance that perfectly balances spooky and sexy elements. As someone who is easily scared, I appreciated that the sex scenes and resolution helped ease the tension. The story follows Penelope and Neil, rival Native horror authors, who are tricked into a writer’s retreat at a haunted castle. The castle is genuinely haunted, and they must confront their personal and professional issues while unraveling the mystery of the ghost. The forbidden door in the west wing added an intriguing layer to the plot. The enemies-to-lovers and forced proximity tropes were executed well, and the haunted castle setting was atmospheric and fun.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Penelope and Neil are complex characters with rich backstories. Penelope is a one-hit-wonder author who struggles with her identity and career, while Neil is a popular author accused of perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Their dynamic is fraught with tension, but as they work through their issues and admit their feelings, their relationship evolves into something deeper. I appreciated that their conflicts weren’t neatly resolved, as it felt realistic and true to their characters. Their banter, especially Neil’s humorous remark about having sex in a haunted castle, added levity to the story.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Wilkens’ debut is strong, with a writing style that blends humor, romance, and horror seamlessly. The jump scares were effective, and the lighter elements balanced the spooky atmosphere. The dialogue felt natural, and the pacing kept me engaged throughout. I also loved the Jennifer Prince cover, which I initially missed but now appreciate even more.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had a lot of fun reading this book. It’s the perfect blend of spooky, sexy, and heartfelt, making it an ideal read for the Halloween season. Despite the concerns about the author’s identity, I found the story itself to be engaging and thought-provoking. I’m glad I read it and will be preordering a copy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis horror romance is a strong debut that skillfully combines spooky elements with a heartfelt enemies-to-lovers story. While the controversy surrounding the author’s identity raises important questions about representation, the book itself is an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. The characters are complex, the plot is engaging, and the balance of humor, romance, and horror makes it a standout.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 ⭐"

The mix of humor within a creepy castle atmosphere was particularly well done, and I’m hoping to read more like it in the future. The spooky setting was very well written, and the ghost felt threatening, with a backstory that pulled me in.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character was interesting, but the shifting of their relationships didn’t feel natural to me. I struggled with the amount of internal dialogue and debate, which made it difficult to follow the intensity of their feelings, both good and bad. I didn’t enjoy being in their heads as much as I would have liked.\n\n- **Plot Progression and Resolution:**  \n  While the ghost and backstory were engaging, the progression and resolution of the haunting fell short. I’m still not entirely sure what happened with the ghosts in the end, which left me wanting more closure for that part of the storyline.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, it was an easy, enjoyable, and offbeat read. I’m looking forward to finding future works by Colby Wilkins.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a lot to love, particularly its unique blend of genres and well-crafted spooky atmosphere. However, the excessive internal dialogue, unnatural relationship shifts, and unresolved haunting storyline kept me from giving it a higher rating. Still, it was a fun read, and I’m excited to see more from the author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The tone between the romance and the horror elements did not mesh well for me, feeling underdeveloped and gimmicky. For instance, every time something tragic or scary happened with the ghosts, the main characters, Pen and Neil, seemed more interested in each other romantically than in the haunting. This disconnect made me question the purpose of the supernatural side plot.\n\n- **Character Reactions and Plot Cohesion:**  \n  The characters’ lack of genuine reaction to the haunting was a major issue for me. Despite the scary events, they seemed unaffected, which undermined the horror aspect. This inconsistency made the supernatural plot feel unnecessary and poorly integrated into the story.\n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  I believe the novel would have worked better if it focused solely on either romance or horror. If the author had chosen to develop the horror element more thoroughly, it could have been compelling. The mystery behind the ghosts had potential, but it wasn’t explored enough to justify its inclusion.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While I was able to finish the book, it was not an enjoyable experience for me. The conflicting tones and underdeveloped elements left me confused and unsatisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel struggled to balance romance and horror, resulting in a disjointed and underwhelming read.

However, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Main Character (Pen):** I found Pen to be immature, petty, childish, wildly self-centered, and lacking empathy. I couldn’t identify a single redeeming quality in her.  \n  - **Neil:** While I liked Neil, his character lacked depth and personality, leaving little to truly connect with.  \n  - **Side Characters:** The other characters weren’t much better, failing to stand out or add significant value to the story.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The writing showed potential, and I believe the author has talent. However, the pacing was a major issue. It felt like a lot was happening, yet nothing substantial occurred, leaving me overwhelmed and unable to recall key plot points even at the 60% mark.  \n\n- **Plot and Execution:**  \n  I liked the concept of the plot, but the execution didn’t work for me. The story didn’t feel serious enough, which detracted from the horror elements. Additionally, the romance fell flat and didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my high hopes, this book wasn’t for me. I can see why others might enjoy it, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its premise and writing, the underdeveloped characters, uneven pacing, and lackluster execution of both the horror and romance elements made it a miss for me.

I finished the book in one day, but the pacing and plot development in the second half left me confused and unsatisfied.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers dynamic between Penelope and N- started strong, with great tension and conflict. However, their transition from hatred to intimacy felt rushed and forced. Penelope’s shift from aggressively demeaning and assaulting N- to suddenly wanting to be with him was jarring. Similarly, N-’s pining for someone who had verbally and physically abused him lacked believability and raised questions about self-respect.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The horror aspect had potential but fell short. The ghost’s motivation—wanting someone to speak her name—felt underwhelming and silly. The few horror moments, like N- being thrown down the stairs, were not enough to create a compelling horror atmosphere, especially in a book marketed as a romance-horror hybrid.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  I cannot comment on the accuracy or validity of the Native American cultural elements portrayed in the book, as it is not part of my cultural background. However, the dynamics between the two Native American authors and their rivalry were central to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and a strong start, the execution fell flat in the second half.

The blend of genres feels unbalanced, with neither the romance nor the horror elements being fully developed. The horror, in particular, is so subtle that it’s barely noticeable, akin to a faint flavor in a drink. The romance also lacks depth, with the characters transitioning from hatred to lust too quickly, making it hard to believe or invest in their relationship.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Penelope, the protagonist, is not very likable due to her strong victim complex, which makes it difficult to connect with her. The side characters are underdeveloped and feel more like props than actual people, to the point that their names are forgettable. This lack of depth in character development detracts from the overall story.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n  The pacing feels rushed, especially in the romance arc, where Penelope and Neil go from enemies to lovers within a short span of pages. Additionally, certain plot elements, like the ghost encounter, are not given enough weight or impact, which undermines the horror aspect and makes the characters’ reactions feel unrealistic.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the promising premise, the book became increasingly frustrating to read. The annoyance built up over time, making it difficult to continue. While I genuinely wanted to like the book, the flaws in execution and character development overshadowed its potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting concept and potential, its execution fell flat.

I received an ARC before this controversy came to light, and I decided to read it since it was already published and the author wasn’t profiting from my copy.  \n\n- **Character Likability and Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Pen, is extremely unlikable and, at times, physically abusive. She physically assaults Neil and verbally tears him down without justification. While she feels some guilt, she never apologizes and instead blames him for her being canceled. Pen’s character lacks development throughout the story, and Neil ends up groveling for minor issues when Pen should be the one repenting and addressing her anger management problems.  \n\n- **Author’s Justification of Characters:**  \n  The author repeatedly tries to justify Pen’s actions, which made me so angry and frustrated that I couldn’t focus on the plot. Pen felt like a self-insert of the author, especially given her white-passing appearance and unverified claims of Native heritage, which mirrors the author’s own controversy.  \n\n- **Representation of Native Identity:**  \n  Pen constantly complains about Neil, an actual tribal member, having an easier time in publishing while she struggles due to her inability to prove her Native heritage. This narrative felt tone-deaf and offensive, especially since Pen hasn’t written or submitted a book in over five years. The representation of Native characters was poorly done and felt offensive at times.  \n\n- **Sensitivity and Editorial Oversight:**  \n  It’s surprising that no sensitivity reader flagged the problematic aspects of this story. I’m guessing a sensitivity read wasn’t conducted at all.  \n\n- **Recommendation for Alternative Reads:**  \n  If you’re considering reading this book, I’d recommend picking up a romance by an actual Indigenous author, such as *The Truth According to Ember* by Danica Nava.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was deeply frustrating due to its unlikable protagonist, lack of character development, and poorly handled representation of Native identity. The author’s attempts to justify Pen’s actions and the absence of sensitivity reading made the reading experience unpleasant.

            "I found it difficult to connect with Penelope, the female main character. The novel begins with her throwing a book at Neil, the male main character, and she never truly redeems herself in my eyes. Penelope's stubbornness and lack of genuine remorse for her actions are off-putting. She tries to justify her behavior by criticizing Neil and his writing, but her leap to deeming it acceptable to physically assault him feels bizarre and hard to overlook.\n\nThe two other author friends at the retreat are one-dimensional, serving only to facilitate Penelope and Neil’s interactions. Their treatment of these friends is disappointing, as they fail to warn them about the real and potentially dangerous ghosts in the castle. Involving these characters in the mystery could have added depth, but this opportunity is missed.\n\nThe romance between Penelope and Neil feels rushed and unconvincing. Their transition from enemies to lovers occurs within a day, lacking the simmering tension typical of the enemies-to-lovers trope. The author attempts to retcon their initial animosity by suggesting a mutual attraction at literary events, but this contradicts the first half of the novel. Additionally, some of their dialogue, particularly regarding the publishing industry, comes across as stilted and inauthentic, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the romance.",
            "I appreciated the visceral and creepy horror moments, which were surprisingly manageable for someone like me who generally dislikes the genre. However, the blend of horror and romance felt jarring.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise vs. Execution:**  \n  I was excited by the premise of the novel, but I found the execution lacking.  \n\n- **Character Development (Penelope):**  \n  I struggled to like Penelope, the FMC. The author opens the novel with Penelope throwing a book at Neil, the MMC, and never manages to make her overcome this mistake in the eyes of the reader (or at least, in my eyes). Penelope is super stubborn and never seems to genuinely regret physically assaulting someone. She justifies her actions by explaining why she disliked Neil and his writing, but her leap to claiming it was acceptable to throw a book at his head was bizarre and hard to get over.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  The two other author friends at the retreat are entirely two-dimensional and exist solely to facilitate Penelope and Neil’s interactions. Penelope and Neil treat these friends poorly by not warning them about the real and potentially murderous ghosts in the castle. Involving them in solving the mystery could have made them more well-rounded and interesting, but this opportunity was missed.  \n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  I appreciated that the horror moments felt visceral and creepy at times, and I liked that the horror aspect wasn’t overwhelming for someone who generally dislikes horror. However, the juxtaposition of horror and romance was bizarre and jarring. There were at least three occasions where Penelope and Neil would have a close encounter with a ghost and then immediately make out or have sex, which felt completely out of place.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance between Penelope and Neil felt rushed and unconvincing. They go from enemies to lovers in the course of a day, which lacked the simmering tension expected in an enemies-to-lovers trope. The author tried to retcon their initial hatred by suggesting they had mutual attraction at literary events, but this didn’t align with the first half of the novel. Additionally, some of their dialogue, especially about the publishing industry, felt stilted and inauthentic, making it hard to enjoy the romance.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n  The writers’ retreat setting was a missed opportunity for a cool story-within-a-story, as no writing actually gets done. The lack of depth in the supporting characters and the bizarre mix of horror and romance further detracted from the potential of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I would not recommend this book. While the horror elements had some effective moments, the execution of the premise, character development, and romance fell short for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The story felt rushed, particularly with the insta-boner aspect. The mystery was underwhelming and left me disappointed. The author seemed to include ghostly encounters purely for shock value, raising questions about their purpose—why would ghosts engage in such acts? The concept of ghostly cum was absurd, and the payback at the end fell flat. Neil and Pen deliberately withheld information about the hauntings from Lazlo and Daniela, which undermined the tension. With all the focus on physical encounters, the central conflict could have been resolved in about 30 minutes. The last twenty pages dragged on, prompting frequent eye rolls. Additionally, there was little buildup from the initial incident to their meeting in Scotland; more character development prior to their arrival would have enhanced the story.",

It would have been better to know more about them before they reached Scotland.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**  \n  - I'm not prudish by any means, but every other word is f*ck, so it's overused on the verge of being annoying. \"Hero\" was another repetitive word.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The insta-boner is a bit rushed in my opinion.  \n  - The mystery was lackluster and disappointing. The author just had the ghosts have sex for the sake of doing it. What was the purpose? Why would ghosts have sex? The ghost cum was ridiculous.  \n  - The \"payback\" at the end was lame. Their friends didn't \"make them suffer the hauntings all on their own.\" Neil and Pen purposefully omitted the hauntings to Lazlo and Daniela.  \n  - Between the actual screwing and thinking about it, everything could have been solved in like 30 minutes.  \n  - The last twenty pages were a drag, and I couldn't help rolling my eyes.  \n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  - Honestly, Pen and Neil's novel about Archie and Georgina would have been more interesting.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  - The title, cover art, and blurb drew me in.

            "The premise of two rival writers entwined with a ghostly twist is both intriguing and engaging. Set in a castle, the story captures the atmospheric essence of fall, making it a perfect seasonal read. The ghost's storyline is particularly poignant, especially the heartbreaking revelation of her separation and pregnancy. The line, “I feel it growing inside me, and there is nothing I can do to stop it,” is devastating and resonates deeply.",
            "In this story, the female main character, Penelope, is quite frustrating. She frequently projects her insecurities and jealousy onto others, especially the more successful male lead, Neil. Penelope's actions as a friend are disappointing; she abandons her friends during a writing retreat to chase after a man and constantly laments her supposed struggles in the publishing industry. Her obsession with feeling oppressed, despite not actually facing any real challenges, is both unsettling and poorly developed.",
            "The exploration of the publishing industry comes across as shallow and unrealistic. Penelope's complaints about her struggles feel exaggerated, particularly given her relative success. The author's projection onto the female main character is too evident, resulting in a narrative that feels self-indulgent and lacking in nuance."

            "About 60 pages in, I felt compelled to Google the author, as Native identity was so integral to the story and its characters that I assumed she must be Native herself. I was curious to see if she had written other books, given the rarity of Native-authored romance novels. However, I found that the author claims Cherokee and Choctaw descent based solely on family stories. She is not a tribal citizen, did not grow up in a Native community, and a third-party organization could not trace any Cherokee or Choctaw ancestors in her family history over the last 10 generations. This revelation left me deeply disappointed.",
            "I was eager to read a spooky romance novel, especially after the cancellation of the queer archaeology romance, *If I Dig You*. The premise of this book was promising, and I was excited to explore a story that focused on Native identity—a theme still rare in romance novels."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations and Initial Interest:**  \n  I was really excited to read a spooky romance novel, especially since I was looking forward to Wilkens’ now-pulled queer archeology romance, *If I Dig You*. The premise of this book seemed promising, and I was eager to dive into a story that centered on Native identity, which is still rare in romance novels.\n\n- **Authenticity and Representation:**  \n  About 60 pages in, I decided to Google the author because Native identity was so central to the story and characters that I assumed the author must be Native herself. I wanted to see if she had other books, as it’s uncommon to find Native-authored romance novels. However, I discovered that the author widely claims to be of Cherokee and Choctaw descent based solely on family stories. She is not a tribal citizen, did not grow up in a Native community, and a third-party organization was unable to identify any Cherokee or Choctaw ancestors in her family history over 10 generations. This revelation deeply disappointed me.\n\n- **Ethical Concerns:**  \n  Even if the author is ultimately able to demonstrate Native ancestry (which she claims she will, though it seems unlikely), I wouldn’t feel comfortable reading a story that so clearly centers on being Native and Native-specific experiences from someone who has no personal or cultural point of reference for this. The lack of authenticity and the potential harm caused by misrepresentation are significant concerns for me.\n\n- **Author’s Response:**  \n  I do appreciate that the author quickly pulled her second book from publication, removed all claims of Native identity, and announced she would no longer be writing Native fiction once she became aware of the investigation findings. While she maintains that the findings are false, this action at least feels like the most responsible step to take if the misrepresentation was unintentional. However, it’s still too little too late, as the harm has already been done.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I initially had high hopes for this novel, the discovery of the author’s questionable claims about her Native identity and the lack of authenticity in her portrayal of Native experiences left me deeply disappointed. Although I acknowledge her efforts to address the situation, the damage caused by the misrepresentation cannot be undone.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish)."

This dynamic raised major red flags for me, as I couldn’t imagine willingly spending time with someone who had harmed me, let alone developing feelings for them.\n\n- **Character Development (FMC):**  \n  The FMC’s growth felt inconsistent, occurring in spurts rather than gradually over time.

            "The ghostly mystery fell flat and felt anticlimactic, with a predictable and underdeveloped reveal. The pacing was uneven, as the haunting and mystery-solving unfolded only in the latter half of the book. The jarring tonal shifts between scary and explicit scenes disrupted the flow. Additionally, the escalating danger felt contrived, arising from characters ignoring clear warnings and entering forbidden areas. While the supporting characters' indifference to the hauntings was understandable, given their lack of exposure to any supernatural events, it still detracted from the overall tension.",
            "The introduction of Penelope through the book-throwing incident made it hard to empathize with her, and her lack of introspection or remorse failed to redeem her actions. Neil's complete acceptance of Penelope's self-righteousness was frustrating and only added to her unlikeability. Both characters lacked depth and chemistry, rendering their romance forced and unengaging. The supporting characters were shallow, serving merely as sounding boards for the leads' relationship. The romance relied on the initial incident and superficial attraction, lacking genuine chemistry. The steamy scenes and flirty banter felt awkward and repetitive, with no meaningful conversations to deepen their connection. The relationship dynamics were unconvincing, and many interactions felt cringe-worthy. Additionally, the potential depth of the dynamic between Penelope (white-passing Native) and Neil (non-white-passing Native) was never explored, missing an opportunity to enrich their conflict.",
            "The book tackles Native representation and stereotypes in publishing, but its portrayal comes across as overly simplistic and lacking nuance.

As a result, the horror and romance plotlines feel disconnected, and the characters' subdued reactions to the ghosts undermine the sense of danger.

They are constantly fighting, yet they engage in hate sex due to their mutual attraction. This dynamic feels unhealthy and lacks the depth or development expected in a romance.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story begins with Pen throwing a book at Neil during a book convention, which leads to her being canceled. She then mopes about the consequences for a significant portion of the book. Later, she joins a writer’s retreat in Scotland, where some spooky ghost events occur. However, these paranormal elements are overshadowed by the unappealing romance between Pen and Neil.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  The romance is poorly executed, with no wooing or flirting. It primarily revolves around sex, which feels shallow and unengaging. The sex scenes are described as mildly interesting but ultimately forgettable, leading to skimming through them.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Pen and Neil suffer from writer’s block, but their personal struggles are overshadowed by their toxic relationship. Pen’s constant self-pity about the book-throwing incident becomes repetitive and tiresome, making it hard to empathize with her.\n\n- **Potential vs. Execution:**  \n  The book had the potential to be engaging, especially with the paranormal twist and the writer’s retreat setting. However, it falls flat due to the unappealing romance, lack of character growth, and underdeveloped plot elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had promising elements, such as the paranormal twist and the writer’s retreat setting, it ultimately failed to deliver a compelling story.

The romance feels forced, lacking genuine chemistry between the main characters, while the other two friends seem to be mere bystanders. Although there are a few intriguing moments in the ghostly horror, the suspense quickly dissipates. The mystery aspect feels more like an afterthought than a central theme. \n\nSet in a Scottish castle, the story follows four writers grappling with their personal histories and turmoil.

However, I decided to approach it with an open mind and separate the story from its creator.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  Listening to the audiobook, courtesy of @librofm ALC program, I appreciated that both narrators are Indigenous, which added authenticity to the performance. While they brought a lot to the table, good narration can only do so much.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows four writers on a retreat to a castle in Scotland, where their histories and personal turmoil are constantly brought up. The story is experienced through two Indigenous characters: one a renowned horror author and another who struggles with her lack of tribal connection. Each writer specializes in a different genre—romance, horror, thriller, and mystery—which is an interesting concept in theory.\n\n- **Genre Balance and Execution:**  \n  The book struggled to balance the romance, mystery, and horror elements. Instead of blending seamlessly, it felt like no genre got a chance to shine. The romance was underwhelming, with forced chemistry between the main characters, while the other two friends felt like they were just along for the ride. The ghostly horror aspects had a few intriguing moments, but the suspense fizzled out quickly. The mystery aspect felt more like a side note than a driving force.\n\n- **Character Development and Dialogue:**  \n  Penelope, the main character, often breaks into intense \"soap box\" moments, especially when addressing the love interest, Storm. These moments became repetitive and detracted from the story.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  I finished the book and didn’t hate it, but it felt like it needed more focus. It tried to be too many things at once—romance, literary fiction with a message, and a mystery ghost story. I wish it had settled on one genre and let it shine.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and authentic narration, it struggled with genre balance and focus. The romance, horror, and mystery elements didn’t blend well, and the repetitive dialogue detracted from the story. Ultimately, it felt like it tried to do too much without excelling in any one area.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The pacing feels slow, and there is noticeable repetition throughout the book.  \n\n- **Romantic and Steamy Moments:**  \n  The \"extremely hot almost-kiss\" I was looking forward to turned out to be underwhelming and barely noticeable. Most of the supposedly steamy moments fell flat and failed to deliver the promised intensity.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Spookiness:**  \n  The setting of a haunted castle in Scotland had potential for spooky moments, but this aspect was entirely absent, leaving the atmosphere feeling lackluster.  \n\n- **Character Likability:**  \n  The female main character (FMC), Penelope, was unlikable due to her aggressive and mean behavior toward Neil throughout the book.

I was also intrigued by the promise of horror, as it offered a chance to explore something new.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing felt disjointed and didn’t flow well. The plot was presented in fits and starts, and the inner dialogue was repetitive, which made it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There was much less character development than needed to truly connect with the characters. Penelope, in particular, came across as self-righteous and unlikable, especially with her actions like assaulting another author and then feeling victimized. Neil was the most developed and likable character, but even he didn’t receive enough depth. The side characters were given random and shocking details about their history with the main characters, but these details were never explored further, which felt bizarre.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot didn’t make sense in several areas. For instance, it was odd that there were only four characters at the castle writing retreat, and they somehow knew about this setup before arriving. The small pool of characters made it harder to achieve depth and execute the story effectively. Additionally, the characters were upset about the castle being haunted, even though that was the whole point of the retreat, which felt contradictory.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Altogether, the book didn’t meet its potential due to underdeveloped characters and a plot that lacked coherence and flow. While I appreciate the effort that went into creating this story, it simply wasn’t for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement, this book fell short of my expectations. The disjointed writing, lack of character development, and inconsistent plot made it difficult to enjoy.

This is one of my favorite writing styles, as it allows me to see what both characters are thinking and feeling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential, particularly with its dual POV structure, the conflict, character dynamics, and lack of tension made it difficult for me to connect with the story or the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

From the prologue, she exhibited rage and aggression with little remorse for her repetitive wrong behavior, making her difficult to like or root for.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamic (Penelope and Neil):**  \n  The relationship between Penelope and Neil felt unconvincing. They went from extreme dislike to a deeper connection in just a few days, which was hard to believe given their initial interactions. I also wanted Neil to have more backbone and conviction, especially during the final conflict when he seemed to worship Penelope rather than focus on his own peril.\n\n- **Setting and Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The castle setting and paranormal elements were lackluster. Given the book's \"horror\" genre tag, I expected the subplot to take a more compelling direction.\n\n- **Reading Experience (ARC and ALC):**  \n  I initially planned to use both the ARC and ALC to enhance the experience, but this plan quickly fell apart. If I had only been reading the ebook, I likely would have marked it as a DNF (Did Not Finish) due to a lack of investment in the story.\n\n- **Narration Performance:**  \n  Despite the book's shortcomings, I enjoyed the performances of the narrators.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its intriguing premise and strong narration, it ultimately fell short due to unlikable characters, an unconvincing romance, and underwhelming setting and paranormal elements.

However, the execution fell flat for me.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers dynamic felt strange and immature, as their dislike for each other was solely based on being writers in the same genre. The female main character (FMC) was particularly exhausting to be in the head of, coming across as childish and immature.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing felt off, with neither the romance nor the horror aspects fully developed. The main love interests stopped hating each other very quickly, making their relationship feel unearned.

What really solidified this feeling was how often the FMC and MMC mentioned that their feelings for each other had done a complete 180. This was brought up repeatedly by both characters throughout the book, which made the romance feel less authentic and more forced.\n\n- **Mystery Element:**  \n  The mystery element was not very interesting, and the conclusion was underwhelming. The ghost’s motivation—being angry because no one knew her story and she didn’t get to live a longer life with her husband—felt random and unconvincing. While I understand ghosts seeking closure or loved ones, this particular reasoning didn’t resonate with me.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  If you enjoy spicy scenes and don’t mind an underwhelming mystery, this book might be a fun, light read for you. However, it didn’t fully work for me due to the issues with the romance and the mystery.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some enjoyable elements, such as the spicy scenes, the insta-love romance and the unconvincing mystery made it a less satisfying read for me.

Pen's sudden outburst and subsequent dialogue seemed forced, making it difficult to engage with the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked clear motivations and chemistry, which made it challenging to connect with them or the story. Their development felt underdeveloped and inconsistent throughout the book.  \n\n- **Tone and Engagement:**  \n  The overall tone of the book was disappointing, failing to create a compelling atmosphere. This, combined with the weak character development, made it hard to stay engaged with the story.  \n\n- **Opening Scene:**  \n  The opening scene at the convention was awkward and confusing, setting a poor tone for the rest of the book.

The clunky dialogue, lack of character development, and awkward opening scene made it difficult to connect with the story.

I felt the story would have been stronger if it focused solely on the haunted castle and the writers visiting it, rather than incorporating the \"enemies to lovers\" trope.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both main characters were disappointing. Pen came across as abusive and whiny throughout the book, while Neil was cowardly and irksome. I didn’t connect with or like any of the characters, which made it hard to stay engaged.\n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  While the book wasn’t horrible, it wasn’t for me. I was happy to finish it, but I’ve read both worse and better novels. The story had potential, but the execution fell short of my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had some enjoyable elements, but the weak character development and pacing issues made it a disappointing read for me. It wasn’t terrible, but it didn’t resonate with me either.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The story could have benefited from a slower burn or more background to better showcase her development and efforts to improve.\n\n- **Trope Execution:**  \n  The rivals/enemies-to-lovers trope, which the reviewer usually enjoys, was taken too far in this novel, making it less effective and enjoyable.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing itself was good, but the character dynamics and execution of the trope detracted from the overall experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling premise and strong writing, the lack of character growth and overdone trope execution made it less enjoyable. The chilling atmosphere of the haunted castle was a highlight, but the main character's unlikable nature and lack of development left the reviewer unsatisfied.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, the Tribal Alliance Against Frauds investigated her claims and found no Native ancestry. Profiting off indigenous people without any connection to them is unethical. I received her second book but will not be reviewing it in light of these claims.\n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The enemies-to-lovers trope felt rushed, especially considering the woman was physically violent toward the man. Their quick transition from conflict to intimacy was concerning. Falling in love in a haunted house could have been intriguing, but the explicit, \"horny\" sex scenes felt out of place in such a setting. I wouldn’t risk being naked in a potentially haunted bed!\n\n- **Ghost and Haunting Elements:**  \n  The ghost’s description was terrifying and well-executed. However, the reason for her haunting was underwhelming. Her motivation—being forgotten and her husband haunting the cellar—felt weak and lacked depth. It could have been so much more compelling, but the explanation fell flat and left me disappointed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the ghost’s description was effective, the weak haunting rationale and rushed romantic subplot detracted from the story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - I love a good thriller and romance, so I thought the horror + romance combo of this book sounded perfect!  \n  - The romance side of this novel is strong - enemies to lovers trope, quite fiery and salacious.  \n  - I didn't find the haunting/horror side of things to be as realistic as I'd have liked. Generally, horror has me on the edge of my seat, but I actually found it to be more comical than fear-invoking.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The supporting characters, Daniela and Laszlo, are fun and relatable.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Colby Wilkens is a lovely writer.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - While I did enjoy the book, it wasn't really what I expected, hence the 3-star review. I'd give it 3.5 if half stars were a thing.  \n  - Overall, it's a good, fun read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a strong romance with an enemies-to-lovers trope and relatable supporting characters, but the horror elements fell short of expectations, leaning more toward comical than fear-inducing. Despite this, it was an enjoyable read, though not entirely what I anticipated.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars (or 3.5 if half stars were available).  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for giving me the opportunity to read this novel in exchange for an honest review."

I am relieved I did not purchase the book and only rented it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story heavily revolves around sexual content, which is frequent and may appeal to those seeking that experience. However, I found myself skipping several sections, including a substantial 20-30 minute segment of the audiobook, as it was dominated by sex scenes. While some minor plot points were woven into these moments, they felt overwhelming. The ghost subplot was particularly underwhelming; it lacked excitement, and the resolution felt weak and almost like an afterthought, with the ghost's actions lacking real impact or significance.",
            "I appreciated the inclusion of two Indigenous authors, as their heritage was integral to their identities without completely defining them. They were portrayed as multifaceted individuals with their own desires and goals, while remaining connected to their roots. However, I found Daniela to be an unnecessary character, seemingly included only to serve as a source of conflict and to avoid an awkward love triangle. Her removal would have had little impact on the story, aside from making it less irritating. I struggled to connect with the main characters; while I didn’t actively dislike them, I found it hard to care about their feelings or struggles. Penelope, in particular, frustrated me with her prolonged assumption that she was hated, without ever seeking to understand how others truly felt about her actions. This aspect felt both unnecessary and exasperating.",
            "The phrase \"finger banged\" felt jarring and out of place, detracting from the overall tone of the book. The inconsistent tone, particularly with characters engaging in sex while fearing for their lives, made it difficult to take the story seriously.",

            "The enemies-to-lovers premise falls flat, leaving me wondering, “THAT’S the reason?” I think it’s time for me to steer clear of anything labeled E2L, as I typically find it disappointing."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book annoyed me because everything felt pointless. There was too much sex, not enough focus on the ghost plot, and none of it seemed to matter in the end.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Representation and Setting:**\n  - I enjoyed seeing two indigenous authors and the fact that it was part of the identity and story for both of them, but didn’t 100% define them. They had other traits, desires, and goals in life, while also being in touch with their heritage and family roots.\n  - I liked that it was set in Scotland, although ultimately that wasn’t seen much and didn’t really matter as any remote place would have done.\n\n- **Premise and Character Dynamics:**\n  - The enemies-to-lovers premise is weak. It’s the sort of thing where you get into it and go, “THAT’S THE REASON?” Pfft. I think I just need to stop reading anything that says E2L because I usually hate it.\n  - Daniela was a useless character. She seemed to exist solely to be someone to hate and to avoid an awkward threesome dynamic. She could have been 100% removed, and the story wouldn’t have been affected except to be slightly less annoying.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n  - Most of the story felt like it was sex. It’s frequent, and if you’re here for that, you’re in for a treat. However, I had to skip multiple sections, including a solid 20-30 minute chunk of the audiobook, because it was just sex scenes. Small plot points were occasionally sneaked into these scenes, but it was overwhelming.\n  - The ghost plot was underwhelming. It didn’t feel exciting, and the resolution was weak. It almost felt like an afterthought, as if the ghost’s actions had no real impact or significance.\n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Engagement:**\n  - I never liked either of the main characters. I didn’t especially dislike them, but I never cared about their feelings, success, or struggles.\n  - Penelope (“Pen”) annoyed me the most because she spiraled for years into assuming she was hated without ever bothering to gauge how people actually felt about her actions. This felt unnecessary and frustrating.\n\n- **Tone and Writing Style:**\n  - The phrase “finger banged” was used, which I really hated. It felt jarring and out of place.\n  - The tone of the book often felt inconsistent, especially with the characters engaging in sex while simultaneously fearing for their lives. It was hard to take seriously.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book annoyed me because everything felt pointless. There was too much sex, not enough focus on the ghost plot, and none of it seemed to matter in the end. While I appreciated the representation of indigenous authors and the Scottish setting, these elements weren’t enough to salvage the weak premise, underdeveloped characters, and unsatisfying resolution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a low rating, likely 2/5 or lower."

Pen has an undeserved one-sided rivalry with Neil, even physically harming him with a book, leaving him scarred. She doesn’t listen to his side of the story or his reasoning for writing his book the way he did.\n  - Their relationship progresses too quickly, shifting from dislike to love in about a day or two. The romantic scenes feel inappropriate and lack meaningful development, making it hard to believe they genuinely care for each other beyond physical attraction.\n  - Pen’s avoidance of the word “sex” and her use of “other thing” comes across as immature and gives off “little kid energy.”\n\n- **Horror Elements:**\n  - The horror elements are not particularly scary and feel underdeveloped. They seem to appear only when convenient or to push the main characters together.\n  - The reason for the haunting is vague and is easily dismissed at the end, making the resolution feel rushed and unsatisfying.\n  - The inclusion of “ghost jizz” is unnecessary and adds nothing to the story, coming across as more absurd than humorous.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**\n  - The book briefly touches on the challenges POC and Native authors face in publishing, such as the “token diverse author” problem, but this discussion feels hollow and underdeveloped. There was potential for a deeper exploration of this issue, but it was not fully realized.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n  - Despite initial excitement about the premise—two Native main characters, a Scottish setting, and a horror vibe—the book failed to deliver on any of these elements. None of the aspects of the story resonated with me, and I did not enjoy it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *If I Stopped Haunting You* was not a book for me. The characters lacked depth, the romance felt rushed and unconvincing, the horror elements were underwhelming, and the themes of representation were not explored in a meaningful way. I found no enjoyment in any aspect of the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Lowering rating due to the recent discussion around the author’s dishonesty about being Native.

Even when they eventually communicate and understand each other better, the romance lacks authenticity.\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Themes:**  \n  The portrayal of physical abuse by the FMC (Penelope) toward the Native MMC (Neil) is deeply problematic. Penelope’s justification for her actions—feeling that Neil is profiting from stories he shouldn’t be writing—adds another layer of discomfort. This aspect of the story feels especially egregious and detracts from the overall narrative.\n\n- **Horror and Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The horror aspect of the story falls flat. The ghost’s presence lacks depth and intrigue, with no compelling backstory or twist. The reveal that the ghost is simply sad about dying young is underwhelming, offering no foul play, unrequited love, or interesting motive. The paranormal elements could have been improved with a more engaging twist, such as the castle keeper being the antagonist.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The setting is one of the book’s strengths. The creepy castle and the journey through Scotland create an atmospheric tone that is both eerie and cozy. However, the rest of the story fails to live up to the potential of this well-crafted setting.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Plot Holes:**  \n  The castle keeper is an underutilized character who adds little to the story.

The repetitive nature of these interactions becomes tedious and unengaging.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book’s tone is unsettling and could have worked better if marketed as a horror novel due to its terrifying and uncomfortable portrayal of Pen’s behavior. However, as it stands, the tone clashes with the intended narrative, making it difficult to connect with the story.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing itself is not compelling enough to justify Pen’s character or the repetitive plot. The specific and exaggerated nature of Pen’s victimhood raises questions about the author’s intent and whether the story is based on personal experiences, which detracts from the overall quality.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  The book fails to engage the reader due to its unlikable protagonist, repetitive conflicts, and lack of a compelling narrative. The toxic behavior of Pen and the unresolved tension make it difficult to continue reading, leading to the decision to stop at 25%.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s unlikable protagonist, repetitive plot, and unsettling tone make it a challenging and unenjoyable read. While the premise had potential, the execution falls short, leaving the reader disengaged and frustrated. The book might have worked better as a horror story, but as it stands, it fails to deliver a compelling narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF @ 25%."

Unfortunately, it fell far short of my expectations and turned out to be a disappointing read.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The book was incredibly slow-paced and boring. I struggled to stay awake while reading it, and it took me a long time to finish because I didn’t want to DNF (did not finish) it. However, by the end, I regretted not abandoning it sooner, as it felt like a waste of time.  \n\n- **Genre Execution:**  \n  The concept of blending horror with a rom-com was intriguing, but the execution was poor. The romance was dull and toxic—the female main character (FMC) assaulted the male main character (MMC) early on and later gaslit him, making him seem like the problem when she was clearly in the wrong. The horror elements were also underwhelming, with an unsatisfying ending that ruined the brief interest I had around the 70% mark.  \n\n- **Author Controversy:**  \n  After finishing the book, I discovered that the author, Colby Wilkins, has been lying about her Native American heritage to promote herself and her work. This revelation has made me decide not to support her in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial excitement for this book, it failed to deliver on multiple fronts—poor pacing, lackluster genre execution, and a disappointing ending.

            "This story blends enemies-to-lovers with forced proximity, all set against a backdrop of haunted house intrigue. When Pen and Neil reluctantly attend a writers' retreat, they find themselves trapped in a haunted house together. However, the pacing is sluggish, and I craved more eerie atmosphere and ghostly encounters. Ultimately, the haunted house aspect fell short of my expectations.",
            "Pen and Neil are rivals in the literary world. Pen remains committed to her indigenous culture in her writing, but this authenticity has not brought her the success she desires. In contrast, Neil has compromised his integrity, catering to his publisher's demands and whitewashing his work, ultimately achieving bestseller status. Their public confrontation during a panel has significant consequences for both. Pen's behavior comes off as self-righteous and verbally aggressive; she accuses Neil without allowing for a genuine dialogue. She blames him for her struggles, and her actions escalate to physical violence when she throws a book at him, which is never acceptable.",
            "I cannot recommend this book. The author claims to be indigenous and presents an indigenous story, yet their only connection to this heritage appears to be family lore and speculation. This is particularly troubling given the narrative's focus on the treatment of Native authors in publishing and the pressure to whitewash their stories. The fact that it is written by someone who is white and lacks genuine ties to the indigenous community they purport to represent complicates the portrayal of Neil and Pen. While Neil is depicted as a tribal member, Pen is characterized as a non-member with minimal ties to the indigenous community, which heightens the discomfort surrounding their interactions.",
            "The exploration of minorities and the pressure to conform for public acceptance was well-executed and the highlight of the book. Unfortunately, this was overshadowed by issues related to authenticity and problematic character dynamics."

        "conclusion": "While the book attempts to tackle important themes about minority representation in publishing, it is undermined by its slow pacing, lack of spooky elements, and the problematic portrayal of characters and relationships. The revelation about the author’s lack of indigenous heritage further complicates the narrative and makes the story feel disingenuous. Overall, the issues with the book overshadow its strengths.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Authenticity and Representation:**  \n  I cannot recommend this book as the author claimed to be indigenous and wrote an indigenous story with no heritage of being indigenous known other than family lore and speculation. The fact that this narrative about Native treatment in publishing and the theme of Native authors having to whitewash their stories was written by someone who is white and has no ties to the indigenous community they are claiming to be part of makes the treatment of Neil by Pen even more problematic. Pen is written as only a non-member and part white with only a small tie to the indigenous community she claims, while Neil is written as a tribal member, which adds to the discomfort.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Pen and Neil are enemies in the writing scene. Pen has stayed true to her indigenous culture in her writing, which hasn’t gotten her far, while Neil has bent to the whim of his publisher and whitewashed his books to make them more palatable, becoming a bestseller. Their public battle during a panel leads to ramifications for both. Pen comes across as holier-than-thou and verbally abusive, accusing Neil without listening or making space for an honest conversation. She blames him for her lack of success, and there’s even an instance of physical violence (throwing a book at someone), which is never okay.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is an enemies-to-lovers meets forced proximity tale with a sprinkle of haunted house vibes. When Pen and Neil are convinced to go on a writers’ retreat, they end up stuck in a haunted house together. However, the pacing felt slow, and I wanted more spooky vibes from the haunted house and ghosts. The haunted house element didn’t deliver as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The discourse around minorities and the expectations to whitewash for public consumption was well done and the only part I truly enjoyed. However, this was overshadowed by the other issues in the book, particularly the authenticity concerns and the problematic character dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book attempts to tackle important themes about minority representation in publishing, it is undermined by its slow pacing, lack of spooky elements, and the problematic portrayal of characters and relationships. The revelation about the author’s lack of indigenous heritage further complicates the narrative and makes the story feel disingenuous.

            "It's refreshing to see increased Indigenous and Native representation in the predominantly white romance genre, particularly among bestsellers. This is the first mainstream romance I can recall that features Native characters and explores relevant issues. However, the central emotional dynamic falters, as the narration repeatedly states that the characters dislike each other without effectively demonstrating the reasons behind it. The stakes of the enemies-to-lovers trope are weakly established, rendering the relationship unconvincing. Additionally, background characters are introduced poorly, and their emotional responses often lack coherence.",

The idea of creatives holed up in a spooky Scottish castle intrigued me, especially since I spent Halloween in Edinburgh this year. However, my expectations were quickly dashed.\n\n- **Romantic Dynamic:**  \n  Instead of a charming enemies-to-lovers story, I got an abusers-to-lovers nightmare. The main character literally assaults her future love interest with a book, hard enough to send him to the hospital and leave a scar. This problematic dynamic was a major turn-off. Imagine if a guy physically attacked a woman publicly—how is this considered romance-origin material? It’s baffling and unacceptable.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  While the retreat being set in Scotland was a plus (it’s why I chose the book), the atmosphere didn’t deliver the spooky vibes I was hoping for. The supernatural elements felt cringe-worthy rather than intriguing.\n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The plot was dull, and the characters were unlikeable. The story failed to engage me, and I ultimately decided not to finish the book (DNF).\n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n  The cover was the best part of the book. It was visually appealing and did a great job of catching my attention. Kudos to the artist!\n\n- **Author Controversy:**  \n  On a side note, I’ve learned that the author is apparently cosplaying as Indigenous, which is deeply concerning. However, this book earned its 1-star rating based on its own merits (or lack thereof).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fell far short of my expectations.

            "I am deeply disappointed to see yet another white author misrepresenting themselves as part of a marginalized race and writing about that community without genuine understanding. The Tribal Alliance Against Frauds conducted thorough research into the author's claimed Indigenous background and found no genealogical evidence to support her assertions. I encourage readers to check their article for more details. The author has since removed any references to being an Indigenous writer from her bios, as if that could erase the issue. As someone from the Pacific Northwest, I witness both the beauty of Native representation and the ongoing effects of their displacement daily. When a white person appropriates local tribal culture, it reflects a colonial mindset. This disregard for the impact on the community being portrayed, as well as on authors of color and the publishing industry as a whole, is profoundly self-centered."

I encourage readers to visit their article for more details.\n  - Wilkens has since removed any reference to being an Indigenous author from her bios, as if that will erase the issue.\n  - As someone from the Pacific Northwest (PNW), I see both beautiful Native representation and evidence of their displacement in my everyday life. For a white person to appropriate local tribal culture is a form of colonizing behavior.\n  - This lack of consideration for the impact on the group being portrayed, actual authors of color, and the publishing industry as a whole is deeply self-centered.\n\n- **Reader Trust and Industry Impact:**\n  - I was initially excited to read this book, as it would have been the second traditionally published Indigenous contemporary romance on the market, following *The Truth According to Ember* by Danica Nava.\n  - However, prior to publication, I encountered negative early reviews criticizing the main character’s behavior. Despite this, I wanted to form my own opinion and checked the book out from the library.\n  - Actions like Wilkens’ erode my confidence in the books I choose to read and in the publishing industry as a whole. When will authors realize that readers care when their lies are exposed?\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis review expresses deep disappointment in the author’s lack of authenticity and the harmful impact of cultural appropriation. It highlights the importance of truthful representation and the erosion of reader trust in both authors and the publishing industry due to such actions.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review."

The spooky aspect was meh at best, and the spice, while good, often felt like filler rather than a way to move the plot along.\n\n- **Character Development (Pen):**  \n  Pen, the female main character (FMC), was absolutely horrendous. She had a redemption arc where she understood why she got so mad (and assaultive) towards Neil, but even after her \"growth\" arc, she still came across as abusive and gaslighting to me.\n\n- **Character Development (Neil):**  \n  Neil, the male main character (MMC), is hurting and complex, but Pen just kicks him while he's down. Their dynamic, especially the enemies-to-lovers trope, gave me the ick because of my thoughts on Pen.\n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  The stuck and struggling writer aspect was gold, especially when tied with some fun ideas surrounding the haunted castle theme.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was a miss for me.

She feels entitled and believes everyone owes her something. Her actions, including assaulting someone so severely that they are left with a scar, are never followed by an apology. Instead, she continues to tear down the man she attacked and justifies her behavior by claiming she is being \"cancelled\" unfairly.  \n- **Moral and Ethical Insight:**  \n  The author seems to lack insight into the problematic nature of the FMC’s actions, which come across as rooted in jealousy rather than justified. This undermines the potential depth of the story and makes the character’s behavior feel unjustified and unaddressed.  \n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The romantic relationship between the FMC and the man she abuses is portrayed as problematic. The idea of them falling in love while she continues to abuse and undermine him feels gross and unrealistic, detracting from the story’s credibility.  \n- **Premise vs. Execution:**  \n  The premise of the book is compelling and holds great potential, but the execution falls short due to the FMC’s unlikable and problematic behavior, which overshadows the story’s strengths.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s premise is intriguing, the main female character’s behavior is deeply problematic and unlikable, making it difficult to engage with the story.

It felt like a cheap imitation of other works, with a tone that reminded me of ordering a knockoff version of \"Beach Read\" from Shein. The writing lacked depth and coherence, which made it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite my dissatisfaction with this book, I am open to giving the author’s second book a chance. The premise of her next work, described as \"lesbian Indiana Jones,\" sounds intriguing and potentially more focused.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book struggled with identity, trying to be too many things at once and ultimately failing to deliver a cohesive or meaningful story. While I didn’t enjoy it, I remain hopeful about the author’s future work, which seems to have a clearer and more exciting direction.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

However, instead of using it to develop her character, the story expects readers to root for Pen as she manipulates her way out of taking any accountability. This lack of meaningful development undermines the character’s potential depth.\n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The story presents a gross double standard, which is particularly jarring in a narrative that is meant to be progressive. This inconsistency detracts from the intended message and makes the story feel overly ridiculous.\n\n- **Author Controversy:**  \n  The author has allegedly lied about their Native heritage, which adds another layer of discomfort and makes it difficult to fully engage with the story. This controversy casts a shadow over the novel and its credibility.\n\n- **Premise and Enjoyment:**  \n  While the premise of the story is fun, the combination of the protagonist’s lack of accountability and the author’s controversy makes it nearly impossible to move past these major issues and enjoy the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its entertaining premise, the novel is marred by problematic character development, inconsistent messaging, and the author’s alleged dishonesty about their heritage. These issues overshadow the story and make it difficult to appreciate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Originality and Genre Blend:**  \n   - The book is an \"amazingly original blend of rom-com with paranormal elements.\"  \n   - It seamlessly combines romantic comedy with paranormal themes, making it unique and appealing to fans of *Divine Rivals* or *My Roommate's a Vampire*.  \n\n- **Representation and #OwnVoices:**  \n   - The story features Native characters and is an #ownvoices book by a Native author.  \n   - Supporting this book is important because there are so few Native-authored books in mainstream publishing.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The story revolves around Penelope Skinner, a writer who becomes a social media pariah after throwing a book at Neil Storm, a successful Native writer.  \n   - The setting of a haunted castle during a writers' retreat adds a paranormal twist to the rom-com narrative.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Humor:**  \n   - The prologue, written from Penelope's perspective, is humorous and engaging, showcasing her self-awareness and wit.  \n   - The excerpt provided highlights the tension and humor in Penelope's situation.  \n\n- **Characterization and POV:**  \n   - The dual third-person POV (Penelope and Neil) is a notable feature, though it can be confusing at times due to the frequent switching of character names (e.g., Pen, Penelope, Skinner; Neil, Strong).  \n\n- **LGBT Representation:**  \n   - The LGBT representation feels \"shoehorned in,\" with characters mentioning same-gender experiences in passing but never exploring them further.  \n   - The book remains a heteronormative romance despite these brief mentions.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - The book has many highlights, including its originality, humor, and representation.  \n   - Despite some flaws, it is highly recommended for fans of rom-coms with paranormal elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*If I Stopped Haunting You* is a fresh and entertaining rom-com with a paranormal twist, featuring Native characters and written by a Native author. While the dual POV can be confusing and the LGBT representation feels underdeveloped, the book's originality, humor, and engaging premise make it a worthwhile read. Fans of rom-coms with supernatural elements will likely enjoy this unique story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

            "Penelope's character is intriguing but often feels overly self-blaming and passive. I longed for more instances where she took control of her narrative and faced her challenges directly. However, the representation of BIPOC characters, LGBTQ individuals, and the exploration of Native American culture within a predominantly white industry are commendable. These elements shed light on important issues and promote inclusivity.",

            "The narrative features several laugh-out-loud moments that enhance the overall reading experience.",
            "The enemies-to-lovers trope, combined with a slow-burn romance, enriched the characters' relationships and created moments of intrigue. However, the chemistry between the main characters was lacking, preventing a full investment in their romantic journey. Additionally, the horror elements felt underdeveloped and rushed; the resolution of the ghostly hauntings was unsatisfying, and the supernatural aspects failed to add meaningful depth to the overall plot."

        "conclusion": "If I Stopped Haunting You offers an enticing blend of spooky ambiance and romantic tension, making it a compelling read for fans of paranormal romance. While it excels in setting and representation, the narrative falls short in delivering on its promises of both romance and horror. Despite its flaws, it remains an enjoyable read, leaving room for growth and potential in future works by the author!",

            "The blend of romance and mystery in the castle setting made for an engaging and well-paced plot. The tension between Pen and Nick was expertly crafted, and their transformation from rivals to lovers felt both natural and compelling.",
            "The enemies-to-lovers trope between Pen and Nick was skillfully executed, with their forced proximity leading to a deeper understanding of one another. The secondary romance added an enjoyable layer, and the bittersweet revelation at the end was both satisfying and impactful. I found Pen particularly relatable, not only because of her Native heritage but also due to her authentic flaws and choices. Her character felt well-developed and genuine. Nick, too, was unexpectedly relatable, and his intense passion for Pen stood out as a highlight of the story.",

Certain sections were skimmed over, creating gaps that necessitated backtracking. Additionally, the characters' conclusions often appeared illogical or inconsistent.",

While her confidence in the bedroom contrasts with her naivety, this inconsistency detracts from her character. The male main character (MMC) is sweet and understanding, but his excessive naivety and forgiveness of the FMC's behavior feel unrealistic. Supporting characters are underdeveloped and lack sufficient screen time. The enemies-to-lovers trope unfolds with a slow burn, but the eventual payoff is disappointing. Although the sex scenes show potential, they ultimately feel unfulfilling and lack emotional depth. The romance is steamy yet leaves much to be desired, leaving me wanting more.",

            "The prologue establishes a chaotic tone that lingers throughout the book, resulting in a messy narrative. The story follows Penelope and Neil as they attend a writing retreat in a haunted Scottish castle, where they confront a ghost mystery while grappling with their antagonistic relationship. However, the resolution of the ghost mystery is overly simplistic and disappointing, leaving unresolved threads that feel unnecessary. Additionally, the pacing of Penelope and Neil's relationship shifts abruptly from intense animosity to reconciliation and romance, which comes across as unrealistic.",
            "Penelope comes across as petty and overly critical of Neil, harshly judging him for trivial matters like his coffee preferences. Her anger and jealousy dominate her character until she abruptly develops romantic feelings for him, which feels inconsistent. In contrast, Neil is patient and willing to soften toward Penelope, but his character is undermined by unrealistic actions, such as ignoring serious head injuries. Additionally, the side characters are underdeveloped and serve little purpose beyond advancing the main plot.",
            "The haunted Scottish castle offers a chilling and atmospheric backdrop, yet the ghostly encounters are inconsistently experienced solely by Penelope and Neil. The setting feels underutilized, and the haunting mystery ultimately lacks a satisfying or complex resolution. Additionally, the story includes several implausible elements, such as Neil surviving multiple head injuries without adequate medical care. The abrupt reconciliation between Penelope and Neil feels shallow, overlooking lingering trust issues and resentment.",
            "This book explores themes of cultural identity and stereotypes, particularly through Penelope's accusation that Neil panders to white audiences and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. However, the author inadvertently reinforces the damaging trope of an angry woman throwing objects, which undermines the critique of stereotypes. Additionally, the exploration of Indigenous American identity and cultural tensions feels superficial and lacks resolution."

While the setting is atmospheric and the initial premise holds promise, the execution falls short. The abrupt shift in Penelope and Neil's relationship and the unresolved storylines detract from the overall experience. However, readers who enjoy light ghost stories in a Scottish castle setting and can overlook historical and medical inaccuracies may still find some enjoyment in this book.",

It weaves together two main threads: the developing relationship between Pen and Neil, and the paranormal mystery surrounding the castle. The mystery is far more engaging than the romance, with the eerie atmosphere and the gradual revelation of the ghost's backstory being particularly captivating.",

I felt a stronger connection to the characters during the mystery-solving scenes, where the author effectively showcased their distinct personalities. The supporting characters, Laszlo and Daniela, were well-developed and added depth and humor to the story, especially Laszlo, who brought a delightful lightheartedness.",

            "The enemies-to-lovers trope was enjoyable, particularly the forced proximity and initial tension between the characters. However, the transition from enemies to lovers felt rushed and leaned towards instalove, which diminished its believability. The buildup of sexual tension was well-crafted and added depth to their relationship. While I wanted to connect more with Lazlo and Daniela, I felt they lacked sufficient focus and development. The main characters were compelling, but some secondary characters could have been explored further. I appreciated the emphasis on Indigenous authors and the critique of whitewashing in BIPOC narratives. Pen's confrontation of Storm for prioritizing audience appeal over cultural integrity was commendable. The declaration “FUCK THE COLONIZERS!” was both powerful and impactful. The author successfully gave an authentic voice to Indigenous characters, and I hope this continues in future works.",

The dynamic between Penelope and Neil felt rushed at times. While their transition from enemies to lovers was entertaining, it seemed too abrupt, especially given their initial antagonism.

Their indigenousness was woven into their personalities and the story, rather than feeling like a token diversity checkbox. The book also explored the hardships faced by BIPOC authors, such as the competitive pressure within their small community to be recognized as the \"top indigenous\" writer.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The Scottish castle setting was an instant win for me. I adore stories that take place in such atmospheric locations, and this one delivered on that front.  \n\n- **Mystery Plot:**  \n   - The mystery that Neil and Penelope were solving was enjoyable, even if it was relatively easy to figure out. It added a fun layer to the story and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Pacing and Flow:**  \n   - The pacing of the book was well-done. The flow of the writers’ retreat, the enemies-to-lovers relationship, and the mystery all worked together seamlessly without feeling overwhelming.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n   - I wasn’t a fan of Penelope’s character. She came across as very selfish, and just when I thought she had shown some growth, she made an extremely selfish decision at the end, which left me dissatisfied with her arc.  \n   - The dynamic between Penelope and Neil felt rushed at times. While their transition from enemies to lovers was entertaining, the shift felt too quick, especially with the initial focus on their literal assaults on each other.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Plot Integration:**  \n   - I found it odd that Penelope and Neil didn’t involve their friends in the mystery. These characters felt underutilized, serving only as a means to get the MCs to Scotland and then being left out of the loop when strange events unfolded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book for its strong representation, engaging mystery, and atmospheric setting. However, I had some reservations about the rushed character dynamics, Penelope’s lack of satisfying growth, and the underutilization of supporting characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press, and Colby Wilkens for the opportunity to read this book.

            "The romance between Penelope and Neil was a central focus, but it didn't resonate with me. Their transition from enemies to lovers felt rushed, with flirtation and romantic moments occurring at inappropriate times, such as after discovering a rotting corpse. While their rivalry began with Penelope physically assaulting Neil—an element that could be seen as quirky or cute—it ultimately felt problematic. By the end, I warmed up to Neil, but their dynamic often seemed forced and inconsistent with the horror setting. \n\nPenelope and Neil were the only well-developed characters, while their friends served as underutilized comic relief. The friends' lack of involvement in the ghostly mystery felt contrived, especially since their knowledge could have been beneficial. Additionally, the group's decision-making was frustratingly poor, lacking preparation or logical planning in the face of clear danger, which made them resemble a “lobotomized Scooby-Doo gang.”",
            "The writing is well-crafted and accessible, featuring a lighthearted tone that will resonate with fans of romance tropes such as forced proximity, grumpy/sunshine dynamics, and happily-ever-after endings. However, the pacing is uneven, as the romance and horror elements often compete for attention instead of complementing one another.",
            "The humor in the story often missed the mark, with jokes about cheese, Star Wars, and coffee feeling out of place. This comedic tone clashed with the horror elements, resulting in an uneven narrative. Additionally, moments like a character exclaiming, “They’re right behind me, aren’t they?” felt clichéd and diminished the overall tension.",
            "I was initially drawn in by the paranormal elements and the concept of horror authors unraveling a ghostly mystery. Unfortunately, the story fell short of its potential. I anticipated a meta or parodic approach to ghost stories, given the characters' backgrounds, but that never materialized. While the characters often recognized their poor choices—like venturing into creepy areas—they continued to make those same mistakes, which became frustrating and repetitive. Simply acknowledging tropes does not equate to subverting them. \n\nThe horror elements were the highlight of the book, featuring some genuinely eerie descriptions of ghosts, gore, and tense moments. However, the overall tone felt more like \"horror lite,\" lacking the depth of the genre. The characters' decisions often undermined the tension, making it difficult to take the scares seriously. For instance, Penelope and Neil repeatedly ran toward danger instead of away, which felt unrealistic and foolish."

The lack of cohesion and emotional depth made it difficult to connect with the story or its protagonists. Overall, I would not recommend this novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book was a challenging read, taking significantly longer than typical for a romance novel.

            "The story, set in a haunted Scottish castle, had intriguing potential, particularly with its ghostly mystery, which overshadowed the romance. However, the timeline felt rushed, especially upon the characters' arrival at the castle. The romance lacked tension and buildup, coming across more as insta-lust than a genuine connection. Major events, including both the romance and the mystery, unfolded in under a week, which contributed to a sense of hurried pacing. While marketed as fast-paced, the absence of tension left several elements feeling underdeveloped.",
            "Penelope (Pen) and Neil, both horror writers, share a compelling rivalry. However, Pen's extreme act of throwing a book at Neil, resulting in a bloody scar, felt unrealistic, particularly as she faced no repercussions. While the characters often behaved immaturely for their age, their struggle to represent their communities and make their voices heard is commendable.",
            "The portrayal of the publishing industry, especially the challenges faced by native authors, was a highlight of the story. The narrative effectively explores how these authors are often pitted against one another and pressured to alter their stories for publication, making for a compelling and insightful read.",

The narrative focuses more on European aesthetics and descriptions, with Native identity feeling superficial and tacked on.\n   - The discussion of identity is shallow and lacks substance, making it seem like the Native aspect was added as a gimmick rather than a genuine exploration of the characters’ backgrounds.\n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**\n   - The ghost story subplot is poorly executed, with unimpressive scary details, a lackluster mystery, and a simplistic resolution.\n   - The meta-comments throughout the book (e.g., references to *Dorian Gray* and self-referential humor) come across as cringe-inducing and detract from the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**\n   - The book is described as poorly written, with shallow character development, plot holes, and a lack of depth in its exploration of themes.\n   - The dialogue and interactions between characters feel contrived and fail to add meaningful depth to the story.\n\n- **Overall Execution and Publishing Decision:**\n   - The reviewer believes the book is of such low quality that it should never have been published, regardless of the author’s claimed Native identity.\n   - The Native identity aspect, which was likely intended to make the book stand out, is poorly handled and adds little value to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book *If I Stopped Haunting You* is criticized for its poor writing, shallow characterization, and lack of cultural authenticity. The portrayal of Native identity feels superficial and gimmicky, while the ghost story subplot is uninspired and poorly executed. The reviewer finds the book to be of such low quality that it should not have been published, regardless of the author’s background.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- The review does not provide a specific numerical rating, but the tone and language strongly suggest a very low rating, likely 1 or 2 out of 10."

The pacing was a significant issue, particularly with the ghost subplot, which dragged the story down.

Her primary grievance against Neil—jealousy over his success and disapproval of his portrayal of Native characters—felt shallow. She treated him poorly, showed no remorse, and even manipulated him into believing he was at fault, despite his explanation that the publisher had imposed changes on his work. This behavior made her come across as a bully, rendering her an unlikable protagonist. \n\nThe romance and horror elements were underdeveloped in the sections I read.

The horror aspects are underdeveloped, the romance is confined to a few sex scenes, and the social commentary feels superficial, relying more on anecdotes than on meaningful exploration. Centered around a haunted castle with two ghosts and a nemesis-to-lovers trope, the story presents unresolved creepy elements but ultimately feels disjointed and lacks depth.",
            "The protagonist, Penelope Skinner, is poorly developed and unlikable. While her actions are attributed to her being a “young, bright woman, mad at the world,” she ultimately comes off as self-centered, cowardly, and abusive. Her ties to the castle and her behavior during the writer's retreat remain unexplained, adding to the frustration. Although she presents herself as a victim, she consistently avoids taking responsibility for her actions or offering apologies, rendering her a deeply flawed and unsympathetic character.",

Penelope's refusal to apologize or recognize her faults diminishes any chance for growth or redemption, rendering the themes hollow and unresolved."

The story centers on Neil Storm and Penelope Skinner, two Indigenous horror authors who have a public falling out before attending the same writer's retreat at a haunted Scottish castle. The eerie, crumbling castle and its sinister ghost add an intriguing layer to the narrative. As the characters navigate their unresolved feelings, tackle writer's block, and unravel a centuries-old mystery, I found myself completely engaged.",

However, the author's non-Indigenous background and the publisher's decision to cancel her next book were disappointing revelations.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Engagement:**  \n  I will admit that this book took me a bit to get into. I was interested in the relationship between Skinner and Storm, and their two somewhat sidekicks.  \n\n- **Personal Connection to Themes:**  \n  Having Cameron as a surname means I’ve done extensive research on my ancestors and Scotland in general (and yes, I have read and watched Outlander). So the idea of the characters going to Scotland to have a writer’s retreat in a haunted castle really piqued my interest. There is Native American in my ancestry, but I don’t know enough about it to claim to be part Native American. The fact that the author is Native American and so are the main characters was another pro that warranted requesting this book.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  If you’re expecting a book about Scotland or seeing the sights through the characters’ eyes, this is not it. This is a forced proximity, enemies-to-lovers haunted romance.  \n\n- **Character Development and Themes:**  \n  The main characters, while working through their negative history together, are also coming to terms with what it means to be Native in the publishing industry. I feel that this is something many people can relate to, especially people of marginalized groups.  \n\n- **Pacing and Atmosphere:**  \n  The pacing of the novel once they’re in the castle is great, really building up the suspense and horror.  \n\n- **Romance and Writing Style:**  \n  The romance is hot, funny, and feels so realistic (yes, it is a little spicy, but it does not dip into erotica territory). Wilkens writes the characters as if she was one of them, as though this is an experience she had. Since the main characters are all writers, their perspectives are written using beautiful diction that flows as if they are writing their story as it happens.  \n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  This can easily be made into a movie that I would love to go see in theaters.  \n\n- **Overall Impression and Future Expectations:**  \n  If this doesn’t become a bestseller, I will be woefully surprised. I look forward to more stories from Wilkens, especially if she continues with Native American characters. I can’t wait to add this beautiful book to my bookshelf!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of romance, suspense, and cultural exploration, with well-developed characters and a captivating atmosphere. The author’s authentic voice and the relatable themes make it a standout read.
