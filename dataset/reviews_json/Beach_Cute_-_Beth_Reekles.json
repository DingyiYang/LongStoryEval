            "The pacing of the story is generally strong, though the third-act conflict feels unnecessary. Sometimes, it's better to let the good times unfold without introducing extra drama. Overall, the book is a delightful read, brimming with friendship, romance, and comedic escapades. It follows three main characters who meet at a no-technology retreat, where they bond over shared experiences, including a mission to steal a phone and a flood that leads them to a luxury villa.",

The inclusion of spice felt unnecessary and wasn’t very descriptive.  \n\n- **Plot and Writing:**  \n   - The book had a lot of potential with its plot, but the execution wasn’t great in my opinion.  \n\n- **Humor:**  \n   - The humor was present but not particularly strong, earning a 2/5 rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was cute but fell short of its potential. The characters were a mix of funny and annoying, the romance lacked depth, and the writing didn’t fully deliver. While it wasn’t a bad read, it wasn’t outstanding either.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall Rating: ⭐️⭐️  \n- Spice: 3/5 (not descriptive, could’ve survived without it)  \n- Humor: 2/5"

            "I picked up this book for its vibes and didn't expect much from the plot, but I was pleasantly surprised! The concept of a digital detox resort that compels the three main characters to connect and confront their issues is fantastic. It serves as a great reminder that while technology is incredible, it's essential to unplug occasionally (though, I admit, I'm on my phone and laptop 24/7, teehee).",
            "The characters and their struggles felt incredibly relatable, even if Luna occasionally drove me up the wall. I understand that breakups are tough (though I can't speak from experience), but Liam was such a jerk—good riddance! Luna's constant moping and tendency to project her issues onto her new friends were frustrating. Each time she second-guessed her decision to break up with Liam, I wanted to shake her. We deserve better than a whiny, drunken cheater! Still, I saw a lot of myself in Luna, which made her challenges resonate deeply.",
            "This book perfectly captures the essence of summer. With its themes of the beach, poolside lounging, tanning, and summer flings, it truly embodies the season. I read it at the beach, and the experience was nothing short of perfect. *Chef’s kiss.*"

I loved the idea of a digital detox resort forcing the three main characters to connect and work through their problems. It’s a great reminder that while technology is amazing, it’s important to switch off every now and then (though, full disclosure, I’m on my phone and laptop 24/7, teehee).  \n\n- **Characters and Relatability:**  \n  The characters and their problems were super relatable, even though Luna drove me crazy at times. I get that breakups are hard (not that I’d know, since I’ve never been in a relationship), but Liam was such an ass—good riddance! Luna’s constant moping and projecting her issues onto her new friends frustrated me to no end. Every time she doubted her decision to break up with Liam, I wanted to shake her. We’re so much better than a sniveling, drunk little cheater! That said, I could see a lot of myself in Luna, which made her struggles hit close to home.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  This book is the epitome of summer vibes. The beach, the pool, tanning, summer flings—everything screamed SUMMER. I read it at the beach, and the vibes were immaculate. *Chef’s kiss.*  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  If you’re looking for an easy summer read, *Beach Cute* might just be the book for you! It’s the perfect beach read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my first book by Beth Reekles, and it was a delightful surprise. While Luna’s love life struggles were frustrating, the relatable characters, engaging plot, and perfect summer atmosphere made this a fun and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 stars!"

I was pleasantly surprised by the Jodie and Gabriel romance, especially since I typically find YA romances cringeworthy.

The lack of character development, repetitive plot elements, and unsatisfying romance left me disappointed. The writing style also felt mismatched for a YA audience, and I do not plan to read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"
