The plot progresses too slowly, and the storyline lacks fluidity.  \n   - There is no engaging or compelling plotline to make it easier to follow.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - Norman and Ella are close friends who secretly love each other.  \n   - Norman, abandoned by his mother and having lost his father, clings to the hope that his father will return, which makes him afraid to leave the town.  \n   - Ella, on the other hand, dreams bigger and gets accepted into university but struggles to tell Norman about her plans to leave.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Resolution:**  \n   - The story culminates in Ella leaving the town, leaving Norman heartbroken.  \n   - Over time, both characters come to accept that their town cannot be saved.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n   - The book is overly descriptive, which makes reading more challenging.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n   - I found it very difficult to stay engaged with the book and had to push myself to finish it.  \n   - Upon reflection, the book did not capture my interest at all.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel explores the emotional struggles of Norman and Ella as they grapple with their feelings for each other and the inevitable decline of their town. However, the slow pacing, lack of an engaging plot, and excessive descriptions made the reading experience tedious and unenjoyable for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story's central premise is both novel and engaging, centering on Norm's quest to revitalize the struggling town of Norman and inspire hope in his best friend, Ella. However, the plot leans heavily on familiar tropes typical of rural Australiana, including the oblivious young couple, eccentric locals, and a duplicitous antagonist threatening the town's future.",
