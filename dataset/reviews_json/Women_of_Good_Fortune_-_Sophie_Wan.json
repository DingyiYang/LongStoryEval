            "The heist is entertaining in a lighthearted, over-the-top manner, as long as it's viewed with a sense of humor. While the plot is somewhat convoluted, it remains enjoyable as the characters navigate their attempt to steal cash-filled red envelopes from wedding guests.",
            "The three main female characters are quite unlikable, which greatly diminished my enjoyment of the story. Their continuous grievances about money and relationships come across as unjustified, especially since they live comfortably and are well-treated by the men in their lives. Their choice to remain in unsatisfying situations and their sense of entitlement made it difficult to relate to them. Additionally, the side characters, particularly the parents and in-laws, are portrayed as greedy and selfish, further contributing to the overall lack of relatability.",
            "The book tackles challenging themes such as difficult upbringings, poverty, and parental abuse; however, it lacks the necessary nuance to make these issues resonate. As a result, the characters often appear greedy and shallow instead of sympathetic.",
            "The story aims for light satire, targeting the absurdity of high society and materialism. However, effective satire relies on relatable characters, and this narrative removes too much humanity, reducing individuals to mere caricatures. Consequently, I found it difficult to connect with or care about the characters and their struggles."

        "conclusion": "While *Women of Good Fortune* has an intriguing premise and some enjoyable moments in its heist plot, the unlikable characters, lack of subtlety, and failure to balance satire with relatability ultimately made it a disappointing read for me.",

However, I found it difficult to empathize with the characters' decision to steal the money, as their motivations felt insufficiently justified.",

However, most of the issues I had with them were addressed by the narrative and acknowledged by the characters themselves. This felt like a deliberate choice by the author, Wan, which made it hard to penalize.  \n\n- **Genre Execution (Heist Novel):**  \n   - I’m not the biggest fan of heist novels, as I find they often work better in movies where the cinematic montages can hide flaws. In books, it’s harder to keep all the moving pieces engaging, and the flaws become more apparent. While reading about the heist itself wasn’t as fun as reading about the planning, I appreciated the effort.  \n\n- **Themes of Friendship and Interpersonal Conflict:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the exploration of friendship, especially how it was tested and questioned throughout the story. Wan struck a great balance in showing how the tensions boiled over in the third act. Shifting some of the conflict to the interpersonal dynamics of the three women, rather than relying solely on the heist, was a smart move. It added depth and tension to the story.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Growth:**  \n   - At times, I struggled to fully understand or relate to the characters’ reactions, as they sometimes felt outlandish to me as an outsider. However, this gave the characters room to grow and even made me reconsider my own perspective, which was a compelling aspect of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable and worthwhile read.

            "This novel skillfully blends elements of *Ocean’s Eleven* with the opulence of *Crazy Rich Asians*, featuring a heist set against the backdrop of a lavish wedding. The plot remains engaging, particularly during the wedding scenes. However, the pacing stumbles in the middle, marred by repetitive information and insufficient buildup to the third-act drama.",

She feels trapped in her engagement to Harv, whom she believes chose her for his parents' approval rather than for love. \n\n**Jane** is deeply insecure, harboring resentment towards societal beauty standards, her parents, and her husband, Cihao, whom she frequently criticizes. Despite these unlikable traits, she experiences significant personal growth throughout the story.\n\n**Rina** is a career-driven woman grappling with her identity, feeling out of place in both China and the U.S. Her relationship with Vic showcases a classic \"opposites attract\" dynamic, which, while somewhat cliché, remains enjoyable to read.\n\nThe friendship among Lulu, Jane, and Rina serves as the emotional core of the story. Their contrasting personalities and values create tension, yet their bond feels genuine and authentic.",

However, the world-building was exceptional, creating a vivid and immersive setting that kept me engaged. The pacing was consistent, ensuring that the story flowed well and kept my interest throughout.",

Jane came across as self-centered and mean; despite being called out by others, she ultimately triumphed without any growth or redemption, which felt unsatisfying. Lulu was equally frustrating—she lacked a backbone and seemed mostly ineffective until suddenly becoming a power player. This felt inconsistent, given her previous behavior, leaving her friends with no basis to expect such a transformation.\n\nThe romance was also disappointing. Harv and his friend were poorly treated, while Jane's husband, who showed genuine growth and acknowledged his mistakes, was similarly disrespected. The women in the story betrayed and exploited the men, yet still received happy endings without putting in much effort. This lack of accountability made the resolutions feel undeserved.",

            "This heist story is expertly crafted, striking a balance of tension, humor, and emotional depth that keeps me engaged throughout. The pacing is well-tuned, and the intricacies of the heist’s execution are satisfying to follow. The obstacles the women encounter add layers of complexity, elevating the narrative beyond a mere caper. While the ending is gratifying, I found myself wanting more resolution regarding certain characters, particularly Lulu and Harv's family dynamics, and Jane's marriage to Zihao. These unresolved threads left me curious about their futures.\n\nAt the heart of the novel are Lulu, Jane, and Rina—three women confronting societal pressures and personal challenges in Shanghai. Lulu is poised to marry Harv, the city’s wealthiest bachelor, not for love, but to protect her family’s reputation. Jane is stuck in a loveless marriage, and Rina faces workplace discrimination despite her professional ambitions. In a bold move for financial independence, they plan a heist to steal red envelopes from Lulu’s wedding. This engaging premise skillfully blends cultural insights with a thrilling heist narrative, reminiscent of *Ocean’s Eight*.",
            "The three main characters are intricately developed, each facing unique dilemmas. Lulu's internal struggle between duty and desire is compelling, Jane's battle with self-worth and societal beauty standards is relatable, and Rina's fight against workplace sexism adds significant depth. Supporting characters Michelangelo and Mei enhance the heist team, and the exploration of both romantic and platonic relationships adds emotional weight to the narrative.",
            "This novel explores the pressures women encounter in Chinese society, including the stigma of being a \"sheng nu\"—a woman deemed past the \"appropriate\" age for marriage—and the expectation to prioritize family and marriage over personal ambitions. These themes are intricately woven into the narrative, providing a thought-provoking examination of societal norms."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author’s *Women of Good Fortune* is a captivating debut that combines cultural insight, relatable characters, and a thrilling heist. It explores the struggles of women in a patriarchal society while delivering an entertaining and emotionally resonant story. Despite some unanswered questions about secondary characters, the novel is a thoroughly enjoyable read that I would revisit.",

The story maintained a fast pace, keeping it engaging, but the heist could have been more fully developed to align with the buildup.",

However, both the wedding and the heist planning lack depth and detail, leaving them feeling underdeveloped. Lulu's wedding, intended to be the year's most extravagant event, ultimately fails to convey the grandeur and significance it promises.",
            "The representation of asexuality felt forced, resembling a diversity checkbox rather than a natural aspect of the story. Similarly, while the inclusion of Chinese cultural elements wasn't inaccurate, it often seemed awkwardly integrated into the narrative. The story unfolds through the alternating perspectives of three friends: Lulu, Rina, and Jane. Lulu grapples with guilt for being born a girl during China's one-child policy and reluctantly agrees to marry a wealthy bachelor to support her family. Jane, struggling with self-esteem, believes that undergoing plastic surgery is essential for gaining freedom through divorce and finding happiness. Meanwhile, career-driven Rina plans to freeze her eggs in the US but faces setbacks after missing out on a promotion. Overall, the characters come across as insufferable and underdeveloped, lacking the depth and insight needed to understand their motivations and actions.",

She constantly complained about not having enough money to buy designer items, which felt unjustified since her bills were paid and her husband provided for her.  \n  - **Rina:** Rina was okay, but her decision to stay in a job that refused to promote her solely because she might get pregnant in the future was frustrating.  \n  - **Lulu:** Lulu was also okay, but her fear of making anyone angry by saying no made her too passive. She allowed others to push her around and guilt her into doing what they wanted.  \n\n- **Parental Characters:**  \n  The parents of most characters were absolutely atrocious. There were several jaw-dropping moments when they said certain things, which felt incredibly vicious. Lulu's mother, Harv's mother, and Jane's mother stood out as particularly harsh.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I liked the ending, which had a nice surprise twist.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was an enjoyable read with some frustrating character traits and shocking parental behavior.

While there was a heist, the story shifted in unexpected ways that ultimately didn't resonate with me. Although some good moments occurred, overall, it just didn’t work for me.",

The male characters appeared to be genuinely nice, leading me to question whether the issue was a lack of communication or cultural differences that I'm not grasping due to my own background. Unfortunately, the female characters fell short, and the parents were even more disappointing, embodying toxic, stereotypical traits often associated with Asian parents.",

Those familiar with the culture might appreciate the nuances and relate more to the characters, but I found them largely unlikable.

The heist is outrageous, and while things don’t go as planned, the story is filled with twists, heartbreak, and questions about the survival of their friendship.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters—Lulu, Jane, and Rina—are a vengeful team of conwomen who are fed up with society’s constraints. They are funny, brash, clever, and never dull. While I enjoyed their dynamics and rooted for them, I felt the characters could have had more depth. Jane and Rina’s side-love stories were more compelling than Lulu’s main romance, and I wished they had received more focus.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The novel explores themes of female friendship, societal expectations, and rebellion against narrow constraints. It highlights the struggles women face in a patriarchal society and their determination to take control of their lives, even if it means resorting to unconventional methods.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  The book is a quick, fun read with no dull moments. The heist and the characters’ personal situations kept me engaged, and I appreciated the twists in their individual storylines by the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Women of Good Fortune* is an entertaining and empowering story about women who refuse to be confined by societal norms. While the characters could have been more developed, the novel’s humor, cleverness, and themes of friendship and rebellion make it a worthwhile read for fans of heist stories and female-driven narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The idea of a heist driven by cultural and personal motivations is compelling and unique.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The book effectively portrays the evolution of female friendships as the characters grow older. It delves into how responsibilities and obligations to family can clash with personal dreams, adding depth to the characters' motivations and relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing and Execution:**  \n  While the concept is strong, the pacing falters, particularly in the middle of the story. The heist lacks the excitement and faster tempo it deserves, making it feel somewhat flat. Additionally, the wedding, which is supposed to be lavish, doesn’t live up to expectations in terms of glamour and grandeur.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The narrative focuses heavily on completing tasks sequentially, which detracts from the liveliness and energy the story could have had. A more dynamic and engaging tone would have elevated the execution.  \n\n- **Design and Presentation:**  \n  The title and book cover are highly praised for being catchy and visually appealing, adding to the book's overall appeal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis debut novel offers a fascinating premise and meaningful exploration of female friendships, cultural pressures, and personal aspirations.

            "The story unfolds over the year leading up to Lulu and Harv's wedding, with each chapter marking the countdown to the heist. This structure effectively builds tension as the deadline looms and uncertainty grows. However, I found the alternating chapters between Lulu, Jane, and Rina somewhat lacking. While they provide insight into each character, they ultimately prevent us from gaining a fully rounded understanding of them.",
            "I found myself more drawn to Rina than the other two characters. Lulu felt somewhat two-dimensional, which I understand is intentional, while Jane’s obsession with plastic surgery made me wish she would confront her deeper mental and emotional issues. Rina, on the other hand, felt more fully developed, making her chapters more engaging. I often struggle with family dynamics in stories, especially those involving cultures different from my own. While I appreciate learning about diverse cultural norms, I found it frustrating to see Lulu pressured into marriage and societal expectations. It was challenging to set aside my own perspective, as I believe women should have the freedom to choose their own paths.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Interest and Expectations:**\n   - I love a good heist story and also enjoyed *Crazy Rich Asians*, so I was immediately intrigued by Sophie Wan’s debut novel, *Women of Good Fortune*. The premise of a bride and her friends planning to steal red envelopes of cash from a high-profile wedding sounded fun and unique.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The story is told over the year leading up to Lulu and Harv’s wedding, with each chapter counting down the time left to plan the heist. This format added tension, especially as the deadline approached and it seemed like things might not work out. However, I didn’t fully love the alternating chapters between Lulu, Jane, and Rina. While it allowed for better understanding of each character, I felt we never got the most complete picture of them.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I found myself drawn more to Rina than the other two characters. Lulu felt too two-dimensional (which I understand is part of the story), and Jane’s hyper-focus on plastic surgery made me wish she’d address her mental and emotional struggles instead. Rina felt more fully formed, which made her chapters more engaging for me.\n\n- **Cultural and Family Dynamics:**\n   - I sometimes struggle with family dynamics in stories, especially when they involve cultures different from my own. While I respect and enjoy learning about different cultural norms, I found it frustrating how Lulu was pressured into marriage and societal expectations. It was hard to let go of my own perspective, as I believe women should have the freedom to choose their own paths.\n\n- **Heist Execution and Tension:**\n   - I didn’t have high hopes for the heist initially, as the women’s personal motivations made me worry their emotions would interfere. However, the planning and buildup kept me engaged, and I found myself flipping through the final chapters quickly, eager to see if they’d succeed.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - *Women of Good Fortune* was a fun and engaging read with more depth than I expected. While some parts could have been stronger, Sophie Wan’s debut was solid, and I think many readers will enjoy it. I’m excited to see what she writes next.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSophie Wan’s *Women of Good Fortune* is a delightful blend of heist intrigue and cultural exploration, with well-paced tension and relatable, if unevenly developed, characters. Despite some frustrations with cultural dynamics and character depth, the novel is an enjoyable and promising debut that leaves me eager for more from the author.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating was provided in the review."

            "I was disappointed that the heist took so long to kick off, with 230 pages passing before the plan was set in motion. Additionally, I found the last-minute reveal of the money's location—only after the wedding—frustrating. This twist created unnecessary tension and made it feel like the plan was teetering on the edge of failure.",

I empathized with her as she endured relentless criticism about her appearance from a young age, which led her to believe that only plastic surgery could resolve her issues. Her husband, Zihou, and her friends played vital roles in trying to change her perspective. While the novel features a diverse cast of characters, I found it challenging to remember some of them and their connections to the main storyline."

However, I wished for a more emotionally impactful resolution to match the high stakes of the heist.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded up).  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley and Graydon House for the eARC."

However, it’s important to note that while there is a massive wedding, the story and plot are entirely different.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Lulu is by far my favorite character. She is demure and underestimated, which makes her stand out.  \n  - Jane is self-absorbed and cold to others' feelings, which adds complexity to her character.  \n  - Rina is a workaholic who only makes time for Jane and Lulu, highlighting her dedication and priorities.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The heist plot is intriguing, and the differences between the characters make it uncertain whether it will go off without a hitch.  \n  - There is a great redemption arc, along with some nice surprises throughout the book that keep the story engaging.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation and Narration:**  \n  - I appreciate the narrator’s ability to pronounce the Chinese phrases correctly (though I’m unsure of the exact dialect).

The premise is intriguing, but the execution is uneven, especially regarding the heist and Lulu's role, which feel muddled and difficult to follow. While the month-by-month narrative with time skips offers some structure, it restricts a deeper exploration of certain aspects, such as the setting of Shanghai.",

The progression of Jane and Zhi-Hao's relationship feels authentic, with Zhi-Hao emerging as a standout character as he learns and grows in real-time. Rina and Vic's slow-burn rivals-to-lovers dynamic is engaging, particularly as Vic demonstrates self-awareness regarding his privilege. Lulu's transformation from uncertain and docile to a clever conwoman is intriguing, though it could have been explored more deeply. Additionally, her relationship with Harv develops mostly off-page, which feels like a missed opportunity for further character development.",

Her relationship with Harv develops mostly off-page, which feels like a missed opportunity.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The cultural elements and familial relationships are rich and well-portrayed.  \n   - Shanghai is a fun setting, but the narrative's structure limits the time spent exploring it fully.  \n\n- **Tone and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The book is a quick, fun read with a mix of humor and emotional depth.  \n   - The tone is reminiscent of *Ocean's 8* meets *Crazy Rich Asians*, though with a less potent Jesse Q. Sutanto flavor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an enjoyable and engaging novel with a strong premise and well-developed characters. While the execution has some flaws, particularly in the heist plot and Lulu's arc, the cultural richness, character dynamics, and fun tone make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story unfolds at a brisk pace, maintaining my interest in the outcome. However, the heist planning and execution are overly simplistic and lack depth, leaving me wanting more complexity. Additionally, the pacing feels uneven, with certain relationships, such as that between Vic and Rina, not receiving adequate development.",
            "The book centers on three main characters—June, Rina, and LuLu—who grapple with societal pressures and personal challenges. While the multiple perspectives provide valuable insights into their lives and motivations, the character introductions often feel superficial. Some subplots, particularly Rina’s reproductive issues and LuLu’s financial obligations to her parents, remain unresolved or underdeveloped. Additionally, the unlikable traits of certain characters may hinder readers' emotional connections with them.",
            "The dialogue comes across as stilted and unrealistic, featuring awkward phrasing and abrupt exchanges. Additionally, the writing style fails to delve deeply into significant issues, merely skimming over them instead of fully exploring their complexities.",
            "The premise of this story is captivating: an extravagant wedding intertwined with a heist led by women taking charge. The concept of women asserting themselves in a patriarchal society is both compelling and timely. The narrative offers insights into Chinese culture and the intricacies of planning a lavish wedding while critiquing patriarchal and masochistic societal norms, particularly concerning women's roles and opportunities. Featuring an all-female cast and perspectives, the story feels refreshing. Notably, some male characters are depicted with nuance, revealing their struggles with parental expectations rather than being portrayed solely as antagonists."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book is a fun and easy read with an engaging premise that combines an extravagant wedding, a heist, and a critique of societal norms. While it offers a glimpse into Chinese culture and features strong female perspectives, it falls short in character development, dialogue quality, and depth of exploration for its themes. The heist element is underdeveloped, and the pacing could be improved. Despite its flaws, it’s an enjoyable read that skims the surface of multiple genres without fully committing to any.",

            "I was pleasantly surprised that Lulu remained steadfast in her decision about the heist and didn’t fall in love with Harv. The marriage-less ending felt authentic to her character and aligned with the story’s themes. Overall, the conclusion was satisfying and true to the characters, and I hope this integrity is maintained in any potential movie adaptation.",
            "One of the standout elements of this story is the inclusion of the asexual character, Mei. Her characterization—ranging from her impressive driving skills to her passion for anime—feels both authentic and refreshing. I particularly resonated with Mei’s desire to drop out of college to binge-watch One Piece, as it reflects her asexuality and the show's minimal romantic focus. Additionally, Lulu’s firm decision not to marry Harv is deeply affirming. It’s refreshing to see a narrative that respects a character’s lack of attraction and desire for marriage, rather than treating it as something that needs to be fixed.",
            "This book skillfully avoids harmful tropes, such as the notion that one can be worn down into romantic attraction. It conveys a powerful message: it's perfectly acceptable to seek fulfillment outside of marriage or romance. I appreciated that Lulu and Mei never express romantic interest, as this choice is both valid and refreshing, rather than a deficiency.",

I found it far more enjoyable than *Crazy Rich Asians*, which I found tedious due to its overemphasis on wealth. This novel strikes a better balance between character development and engaging descriptions."

Instead, the narrative centers on Lulu, Rina, and Jane, three women in Shanghai society who feel constrained by societal expectations. Lulu's wedding presents them with the perfect opportunity to execute a heist, using the cash gifts to secure their freedom. This intriguing premise weaves together themes of sisterhood, societal pressures, and rebellion. However, the pacing falters, particularly during the character introductions, which slow the momentum. A heist story should be action-packed, but this one lacks the necessary energy. Additionally, the writing tends to tell rather than show, with minimal descriptions and insufficient character development, leaving the story feeling dry and distant.",

While the plot is engaging and full of twists, the writing and pacing could use more refinement to elevate the story. Despite its flaws, it is recommended for fans of Kirstin Chen’s *Counterfeit*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Certain parts in the middle dragged on for chapters, while other seemingly important sections, like the conclusion, were rushed and barely mentioned.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The three main characters, the Leftovers, were largely insufferable.  \n     - Jane constantly complains about her husband, her appearance, and her life in general.  \n     - Lulu lacks the backbone to stand up to anyone, including her mother, brother, fiancé, or mother-in-law.  \n     - Rina is portrayed as a stereotypical strong, independent, emotionless workaholic who denies herself happiness, believing it’s for the best.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n   - As someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture, I found the book’s portrayal of societal norms both shocking and eye-opening. It made me appreciate living in America, particularly for the freedoms women have.  \n   - The concept of women becoming “Leftovers” after a certain age, losing opportunities for jobs and marriage, was particularly striking.  \n   - Arranged marriages and societal pressures were depicted as deeply ingrained, with little room for personal choice or happiness.  \n\n- **Gender Dynamics:**  \n   - Women are portrayed as having no power in any aspect of life. They are denied opportunities, talked down to, and treated as inferior.  \n   - The societal expectations placed on women are harsh and unrelenting, with little pushback from the characters or the author.  \n\n- **Parental Relationships:**  \n   - The parents in the story are depicted as toxic and demanding. They constantly belittle their children, calling them ugly, worthless, and lucky to have any opportunities.  \n   - They expect to be financially supported and spoiled by their children, adding to the characters’ burdens.  \n\n- **Diversity and Representation:**  \n   - The inclusion of an asexual/ace character felt forced and unnecessary, adding to what I perceived as an already-ridiculous storyline.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n   - The book’s cover is visually stunning, with a beautiful illustration of a woman and an appealing color scheme of red, gold, and black.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s cover is aesthetically pleasing, the inconsistent pacing, insufferable characters, and harsh portrayal of societal norms made it a challenging read.

            "The chapter structure, alternating between different leads' perspectives, effectively introduces drama and numerous plot twists. However, the abundance of side characters—parents, love interests, friends, staff, and partygoers—can clutter the narrative. Some, like Mei (my personal favorite), feel sidelined in the sprawling cast. I'm ambivalent about the ending. While Lulu's victory is well-earned and ties the story together, it undermines the arcs of the other main characters. Jane's marriage disintegrates, Rina deceives herself and loses Vic, and Mei primarily serves as a decoy. The financial gains the characters acquire seem insufficient to offset their losses. Furthermore, the five-month time jump feels rushed, with external forces (e.g., Zihao's return, Vic appearing at the airport) resolving issues rather than showcasing character growth or agency. Nonetheless, the ending remains feel-good and satisfying for the characters I grew to care about.",
            "The characters are memorable, each with distinct personalities that ensure clarity in their interactions. The three main characters are well-developed, featuring compelling arcs that, though somewhat predictable, remain engaging.

While Lulu's victory feels deserved and ties the story together, it somewhat diminishes the arcs of the other main characters.  \n   - Jane's marriage collapses, Rina lies to herself and loses Vic, and Mei essentially acts as a decoy. The money they gain doesn’t feel like enough to compensate for their losses.  \n   - The resolution, which skips five months ahead, feels rushed and lacks agency. External forces (e.g., Zihao returning, Vic being at the airport) solve the characters' problems rather than their own growth or actions.  \n   - Despite this, the ending is still feel-good and satisfying for characters the reader grows attached to.  \n\n- **Author's Passion and Potential:**  \n   - Meeting the author, Ms. Wan, revealed her deep passion for the characters and narrative.

            "This book combines elements of \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" \"Ocean's 11,\" and various high-society Asian narratives. It follows three women in Shanghai who scheme to steal a wedding gift in hopes of winning approval from their partners and families. Told from multiple perspectives with timestamps, the story unfolds amidst a chaotic and somewhat unrealistic wedding setting. However, the heist plotline lacks resolution, and the confusing ending leaves readers uncertain about whether the heist actually took place.",
            "The three main female characters lack depth and individuality, appearing selfish, insecure, and neglectful. Each is primarily motivated by a desire to please others, whether themselves or their partners. The portrayal of high-class women in Shanghai feels snobbish and insecure, reminiscent of Sharpay Evans. The only standout character is the asexual man, who offers a refreshing contrast.",

            "This book offers a more introspective take on the heist genre than I anticipated. Nearly two-thirds of the narrative focuses on the planning stages, counting down to Lulu's wedding and exploring the women's evolving emotions as the deadline nears. While this slow build-up adds emotional depth, it ultimately shortchanges the heist itself, which feels surprisingly brief. The story misses opportunities to fully exploit twists and quick pivots that could have heightened the thrill of the heist.",
            "The protagonists—Lulu, Rina, and Jane—are well-developed and relatable. Lulu, a former waitress engaged to a wealthy family, yearns to escape her financial burdens and overbearing mother-in-law for adventure in Thailand. Jane, an unfulfilled housewife, copes with her lackluster marriage through luxury shopping, hoping that plastic surgery will earn her the social respect she craves. Rina, a dedicated career woman, tirelessly works for a promotion to fund her fertility treatments. Their friendship, humorously dubbed The Leftovers, adds depth to their dynamic, making their shared goal of stealing the wedding gift money feel both personal and high-stakes.",
            "The story's emphasis on the protagonists' emotions and desires lends it a tone reminiscent of *Eat, Pray, Love* rather than *Ocean's Eight*. While this introspective approach is engaging, it creates a disconnect between the heist premise and the emotional depth explored. The final twist and resolution feel rushed, leaving me longing for a more satisfying conclusion.",

Her ability to weave cultural nuances into an engaging plot is commendable, and I look forward to following her career.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Women of Good Fortune* is an entertaining blend of cultural exploration and heist drama, though it struggles with pacing and emotional depth.

The story revolves around a woman who accepts a marriage proposal despite not being in love, while her two friends plan to steal the gift money. Each character has their own motivations, and the book explores their perspectives as the wedding approaches.\n\n- **Character Motivations and Development:**  \n  Lulu isn’t ready for marriage but sees the money as a way to help her parents. Rina is frustrated with her stagnant career and the pressure to start a family. Jane wants to leave her husband for a better life. While their individual motives are clear, the story becomes increasingly complicated as the wedding day nears.\n\n- **Exploration of Themes:**  \n  I was initially drawn to the idea of the book exploring the challenges faced by Asian women in a society that doesn’t treat them as equals. However, this aspect fell flat for me, and I didn’t feel the depth I was hoping for.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The rotating perspectives between the three women didn’t work for me. It’s a trope I generally dislike, and in this case, it made it hard for me to connect with any of the characters. The pacing felt off, and I found myself not caring much about their individual journeys.\n\n- **Potential for Adaptation:**  \n  Despite my reservations about the book, I think the story has a lot of potential as a miniseries or movie. The heist elements and social commentary could make for a fun and engaging adaptation, similar to *Ocean’s 11* meets *Crazy Rich Asians*. It might even work better in a visual format, where the heist aspects could be highlighted more effectively.\n\n- **Overall Impression and Recommendation:**  \n  As a book, it felt like it needed more time to develop or perhaps a focus on just one perspective instead of all three. That said, I’d consider reading other works by the author, especially since this seems to be her debut. Borrowing it from the library was the right choice for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting premise and potential for social commentary, the execution fell short for me due to the rotating perspectives and lack of emotional depth. However, I can see it working well as a miniseries or movie, where the heist and character dynamics could shine.

Jane, a married woman struggling with body dysmorphia, seeks plastic surgery to boost her confidence and self-esteem. Their deeply personal motivations propel the plot forward.",

Their relationships with their mothers and a future mother-in-law add depth, often portraying these figures as difficult or harsh. Lulu is spineless, marrying a wealthy bachelor she doesn't love. Jane, feeling unattractive due to her mother's influence, contemplates plastic surgery and mistreats her husband. Meanwhile, Rina, a workaholic who works from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, grapples with the fear of running out of time and considers freezing her eggs.",

            "The story moves at a brisk pace, launching into the plot without taking the time to develop the characters and their relationships. This lack of depth makes it difficult to connect with the narrative or invest in the stakes. Additionally, the ending feels rushed, and the happy conclusion lacks the emotional weight to feel earned or satisfying.",

The three main women were reduced to shallow archetypes: The Pushover, The Workaholic, and The B*tch. Their friendship, intended to be the story's backbone, felt underdeveloped and unconvincing, especially as it began to unravel almost immediately.",

Their friendship, which is supposed to be the backbone of the story, felt underdeveloped and unconvincing, especially as it started to fall apart almost immediately.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Execution:**  \n  The pacing is fast, and the plot kicks off quickly, but this comes at the expense of building up the characters and their relationships. The lack of depth made it hard to connect with the story or care about the stakes.  \n\n- **Antagonists and Stakes:**  \n  The smaller players in the story (e.g., the future mother-in-law, the fiancé, and the friend's husband) weren't compelling enough to justify the high-stakes heist. If they had been more exaggerated or villainous (e.g., a fairy-tale evil mother-in-law or an abusive husband), the stakes might have felt higher and more engaging.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt rushed, and the \"happy ending\" didn't feel earned or satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an exciting premise and potential for humor and heart, it ultimately fell flat due to underdeveloped characters, unconvincing relationships, and a lack of compelling stakes.

The premise of a girl-power caper aimed at getting revenge against The Man immediately appealed to me and prompted me to add it to my Libby list.  \n\n- **Genre and Structure:**  \n  - The novel does not follow the romance novel formula and is not a romantic comedy. Instead, it focuses on a heist and revenge plot, which I found refreshing and engaging.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  - The pacing was excellent, with no moments where the story felt slow or dragged. The chapters are structured around a countdown to the heist—starting with months, then weeks, days, and finally hours on the day of the heist. The epilogue ties up loose ends five months after the heist, providing a satisfying conclusion.  \n\n- **Economy of Writing:**  \n  - Despite being an eleven-hour audiobook with rich descriptions, the story never felt bloated or in need of streamlining. Every detail introduced was utilized later in the novel, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  - The audio version was particularly enjoyable due to the narrator’s seamless integration of native pronunciations into the English text. As someone with no experience in Asian languages, I found this aspect immersive, though readers with such experience might have a different perspective.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  - The book feels like a Shanghainese blend of *Dial A for Aunties* and *Crazy Rich Asians*. I would highly recommend it to readers who enjoyed those novels or similar stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Women of Good Fortune* is a well-paced, tightly written novel that combines a girl-power caper with rich storytelling and immersive narration. Its unique structure, engaging plot, and satisfying conclusion make it a standout read, especially for fans of heist stories and culturally rich narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As an American, I found China’s culture to be completely different from what I had imagined. The book delves into parental relationships, beauty standards, and even societal aspects like surveillance and child limits.  \n   - I was surprised to learn how recently the one-child policy was in effect and that it has now shifted to a three-child rule.  \n\n- **Friendship vs. Romance:**  \n   - Romance takes a secondary role to the friendship between the three main characters, which I really appreciated. Their bond and collaboration towards their own liberation, despite their differences, was a highlight of the book.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Style:**  \n   - The book is fast-paced, which I enjoyed.

However, I was ultimately let down.  \n\n- **Storyline/Concept:**  \n   - The storyline was good, and I remained interested throughout.  \n   - The concept is absolutely amazing—a heist book with women in charge is a fantastic idea.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I did not like any of the characters, but I also didn’t hate them. I just didn’t care if their story worked out or not.  \n   - The three main characters were not likable. While I don’t always need characters to be likable, these characters didn’t evoke strong feelings of dislike either.  \n   - I disliked Jane throughout most of the book.  \n\n- **Character Distinction and Backgrounds:**  \n   - The characters are easily distinguishable, each with their own storyline and background. This made it nice to keep them separate throughout their POVs.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n   - I enjoyed the focus on friendship and personal growth.  \n   - I appreciated learning about traditions and standards in Chinese families through the young women’s perspectives.  \n\n- **Execution of Extravagance:**  \n   - There was so much focus on money and the wedding, but I feel like we didn’t get to see or read about the extravagance as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - I disliked that everyone got a happy ending. It felt unrealistic and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong concept and an engaging storyline, the lack of likable characters and the unsatisfying ending left me disappointed.

There wasn’t much tension until the end, and even that was short-lived.  \n- **Engagement:** I wasn’t bored and remained intrigued about what would happen, but the slow plot and lack of payoff held it back.  \n- **Writing Style:** The writing was intriguing and reminded me of *Free Food for Millionaires*.  \n- **Comparison:** The premise and lack of payoff reminded me of *The Wife App*, which I didn’t love.  \n- **Audiobook Narration:** The audiobook narration was fine. The reader, who has narrated other audiobooks I’ve listened to, switches effortlessly between Chinese names and English writing, which was helpful.  \n- **Author Potential:** I would probably read another novel by this author, but I could take or leave this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise was intriguing and the writing style engaging, the slow pacing, lack of tension, and only okay characters made this a middling read for me.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was hoping for a heist story similar to *Oceans Eleven*, but the novel leaned more toward themes like *Crazy Rich Asians*. While I love a good heist, the details of the heist itself were sparse, and the story focused more on serious explorations of Asian culture, the dangerous allure of money, and the dynamics of female friendships.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book delves into the ostentatious display of wealth, which I found off-putting. As someone who is not wealthy, I didn’t enjoy reading about such extravagance. Additionally, the story includes themes of vengeance, ambition, and the moral compromises characters make to achieve their goals.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Most of the characters were unlikeable, often whining about not getting what they wanted and showing little regard for the harm they caused others in their pursuit of what they felt they \"deserved.\" While there is some redemption toward the end, it didn’t fully satisfy me.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending left me feeling mostly indifferent. It provided some resolution, but it wasn’t entirely satisfying or impactful.  \n\n- **Content Considerations:**  \n  The book contains a lot of swearing and references to sex, though nothing explicit.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel didn’t meet my expectations as a heist story. Instead, it focused heavily on themes of wealth, culture, and friendship, with characters I found difficult to connect with. While there were some redeeming moments, the story fell flat for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n*I received a complimentary ARC from Harlequin Trade Publishing and Graydon House via Netgalley. All opinions are my own.*"

            "My main issue with the novel was Lulu, whose character felt disappointingly flat—blander than cardboard. Although she showed some growth near the end, her spinelessness throughout most of the story was frustrating. While I recognize that her family's legacy of sacrifice shaped her upbringing, it didn't make her any more engaging. In contrast, I found Jane (with all her flaws), Zihao, and Mei to be much more compelling. I appreciated how the author intertwined culture with the characters' imperfections. The influence of their family backgrounds made them somewhat unlikable yet realistic. For instance, Jane's insecurity about her appearance and the societal pressures surrounding marriage, along with the way Rina was perceived despite her capabilities, added significant depth to their personalities."

The impact of different family upbringings on each character made them a little unlikable but also realistic. For example, Jane's insecurity about her appearance and the societal pressure she faced regarding marriage, as well as how people viewed Rina despite her capability and success, added depth to their personalities.  \n\n- **Character Critique (Lulu):**  \n  My only issue with the novel was Lulu. I found her character to be the least compelling—she was blander than cardboard. While she did shine a bit near the end, her spinelessness throughout most of the story was irritating. I understand that sacrifice runs in her family and influenced her upbringing, but it didn’t make her any more engaging.  \n\n- **Favorite Characters:**  \n  My favorite characters were Jane (with all her flaws), Zihao, and Mei.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a good time reading this novel.

I appreciated being able to listen to words and phrases that I wouldn’t have pronounced correctly in my head if I’d read the book.  \n\n- **Premise/Concept:**  \n  I was excited when I read the blurb about a wedding heist. The concept itself was intriguing and had a lot of potential.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found it challenging to connect with almost every single character initially. While I understand the redemption arcs and journeys of self-discovery, starting too far down in the hole risks losing readers before the story gains momentum. That was my experience. However, I stuck with it and eventually came to like the people most of them became, even though many of their transformations felt quite far removed from where they started.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The story takes a while to kick into gear. If you can make it past the first couple of hours, it does pick up and becomes more engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narration was excellent and the premise was promising, the initial disconnect with the characters and slow pacing made it a challenging read at first.

Lulu, engaged to the wealthy but emotionally distant Harv, and her friends scheme to steal cash-filled red envelopes from her wedding to fund new beginnings. While the pacing initially took some time to captivate me, I found myself fully invested as the wedding drew near, eager to see if their plan would succeed.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Concept:**  \n  - The novel is reminiscent of *Ocean's Eight* but set in Shanghai, which I found intriguing and refreshing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Rina’s storyline was the most enjoyable for me, as it felt well-developed and engaging.  \n  - Lulu’s character, however, fell flat for me. She lacked personality and her life seemed to revolve entirely around her ungrateful family and being submissive to others. I felt she was intended to be the central character, but I didn’t connect with her at all.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n  - I appreciated the accurate depiction of how female friendships evolve as we age. The book realistically portrays that not all friendships remain close or survive as we grow into our own identities.  \n\n- **Plot and Engagement:**  \n  - Lulu’s storyline, which focused heavily on the wedding and her family, felt repetitive and uninteresting. I would have enjoyed the book more if her character had a life outside of these concerns.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Women of Good Fortune* offers an engaging setting and a realistic portrayal of evolving female friendships, Lulu’s underdeveloped character and repetitive storyline detracted from my overall enjoyment. Rina’s arc stood out as a highlight, but the book fell short of its potential, leading me to rate it 3.5 stars.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3.5 stars  \n\nThanks to NetGalley, Sophie Wan, and Harlequin Trade Publishing for the ARC!"

Skipping to the end revealed very little growth in their personalities or arcs.  \n\n- **Plot and Moral Justification:**  \n  The central plot revolves around a heist targeting completely innocent people, which feels morally unjustifiable. In heist stories, the appeal often lies in rooting for the robbers because their targets are worse or deserving. However, in this case, the women plan to steal simply because they know there will be a lot of money and because they can, without any compelling reason or hardship driving their actions.  \n\n- **Relatability and Engagement:**  \n  The story failed to engage me, as I found it difficult to connect with or root for the characters. Their motivations felt shallow, and their actions lacked the depth or justification needed to make the plot compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book did not resonate with me due to its unlikeable characters, lack of meaningful growth, and a morally questionable plot that failed to provide a compelling reason to root for the protagonists.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 10%."

However, I acknowledge that it’s not a poorly written book—it simply doesn’t align with my preferences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It challenges genre expectations and delivers a story that feels more like a slow-burn action film than a traditional romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The pacing was uneven, the characters were unlikable, and the themes lacked depth. Ultimately, it was an average read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The heist served as a catalyst for the characters to discover more about themselves and each other, leading to personal growth and deeper understanding.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The friendship between the three women felt very realistic, resembling a \"happy accident\" friendship. Each character had distinct traits—the people pleaser, the overachiever, and the rebel—which balanced each other out. Over time, they began to take each other for granted, making assumptions and not allowing room for growth. The heist forced them to see each other more clearly and appreciate the people they had aligned themselves with.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Through the wedding heist, the characters discovered new aspects of themselves and their friends. This experience opened their eyes to their own assumptions and allowed them to grow and change, ultimately strengthening their bond.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was an enjoyable read, combining a mix of genres and themes to create a compelling story. The realistic portrayal of friendship and the characters' personal growth through the heist made the narrative both relatable and impactful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story evokes the charm of *Crazy Rich Asians* and the intrigue of *Fraudsters*, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot centers around a daring plan to steal red envelopes from LuLu's wedding, aiming to rescue her from a loveless marriage and a psychopathic mother-in-law. The growing team of strong, badass women is reminiscent of *Ocean's 11*, though their scheme is far from foolproof, and capture seems inevitable. LuLu's clever hiding of the red envelopes in her dress adds a brilliant twist, ultimately saving her friends. While there were moments when the pacing lagged and I found myself eager for the story to progress, the book remains a fun read—ideal for a beach day or casual setting.",
            "I found myself enjoying all the characters and their growth throughout the story. They each discovered what truly mattered to them—their happiness. Jane's journey of rekindling her love for her husband and gaining clarity in their relationship was heartwarming, and I was pleased to see them reunite, along with Jane finding a fulfilling job. Rina, a determined go-getter, captured my heart as she fell for Vic, and their happy ending in the States was satisfying. However, Harv felt somewhat flat. The revelation about his marriage to LuLu—choosing her for her beauty and poverty rather than love—wasn't as shocking as I had anticipated, and his struggle to please his parents felt clichéd.",
            "The story beautifully explores the theme of friendship, highlighting the importance of allowing friends to embrace their true, multifaceted selves. It emphasizes the value of supporting others in their journey rather than dictating what’s best for them. The message of empowerment, particularly for women, is both strong and inspiring."

While some characters and plot points felt predictable or underdeveloped, the book was entertaining and had its share of clever twists.

The book effectively highlights how these women, often labeled as \"leftover women\" in Chinese culture, navigate societal expectations and pressures.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  What I loved most about *Women of Good Fortune* was its focus on the stories of these women. The narrative shifts away from the typical end goal of marriage or romance, instead emphasizing their fight against societal norms and arbitrary timelines. This refreshing perspective is something we need more of in literature.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel offers a compelling and much-needed exploration of the struggles faced by unmarried women in Asian cultures, particularly in China.

            "This novel features multiple narrators, each with distinct personalities that make it easy to follow. While the story starts slowly, it builds thoughtfully, which I appreciated. Set in China, it revolves around three friends—Lulu, Jane, and Rina—who decide to steal wedding gift money to pursue their personal goals. Lulu is engaged to a man she doesn’t want to marry, Jane is saving for plastic surgery due to self-image issues, and Rina wants to freeze her eggs to avoid missing out on motherhood. The heist serves as a catalyst for their personal growth and challenges societal expectations. As the narrative progresses, the initial focus on money evolves into a more profound emotional journey for the friends, making the story increasingly engaging as their motivations and conflicts deepen.",

The heist serves as a catalyst for them to break free from their comfort zones, showcasing their cleverness and resourcefulness. Their friendships are complex, with conflicts emerging as their personal interests diverge during the heist. The male characters are equally multi-dimensional, enriching the narrative further.",
            "Initially, I anticipated a comedic tone akin to Jesse Q. Sutanto’s work, but the novel instead tackles serious issues. It examines the pressures young women in China face to marry well and adhere to traditional roles as wives and mothers. Additionally, it explores the struggles of male characters who contend with societal expectations to be providers and maintain control."
