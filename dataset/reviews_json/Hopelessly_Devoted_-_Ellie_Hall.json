        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Context and Standalone Potential:**  \n  - *Hopelessly Devoted* is the third and final book in the SoCal Summer Kisses series. While familiar characters make appearances, the book can be enjoyed as a standalone.  \n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  - Like the other books in the series, this is a short and sweet second-chance romance set in a small town.  \n\n- **Uniqueness of the Story:**  \n  - Although the series revolves around second-chance romances, each book feels unique. This one stands out the most due to its premise.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  - Finn and Bea didn’t have much of a first chance at romance—they crushed on each other in high school, shared one moment, and then Finn disappeared after graduation. When he returns years later, he doesn’t remember Bea or anything about high school due to amnesia.  \n  - The amnesia trope is hard to pull off, but it worked well here, adding a fun and unique twist to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n  - I loved seeing Finn and Bea together and watching them get a real shot at making their relationship work. It felt like the perfect ending to the series.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  - For a short story (easily read in one or two sittings), there was a lot packed into it, and I enjoyed every minute.  \n\n- **Content and Tone:**  \n  - The book is a closed-door romance with kisses only and no explicit language, making it a sweet and wholesome read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Hopelessly Devoted* is a delightful and unique addition to the SoCal Summer Kisses series. With its charming characters, engaging plot, and heartfelt romance, it provides a satisfying conclusion to the series. The amnesia trope is executed well, adding a fresh twist to the second-chance romance theme. It’s a short, sweet, and enjoyable read that I highly recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
