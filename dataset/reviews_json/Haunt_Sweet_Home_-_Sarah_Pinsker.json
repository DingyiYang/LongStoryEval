            "The story began with promise but lost steam in the final third. Mara's repetitive cycle of scaring residents, retreating to her motel, and dining with her crew felt like a monotonous loop that dulled my interest. The middle sections dragged on without engaging incidents, and the mystery's twist became too predictable.",
            "Mara, the protagonist, is a well-developed and relatable character. Her journey of self-discovery, marked by changing majors and facing family mockery—particularly from her cousin Jeremy—adds significant depth to her story. Jeremy, a TV star, is effectively portrayed as someone who overlooks Mara, even while offering her a job. Jo, another production assistant, serves as a compelling yet intimidating presence, challenging Mara to reevaluate her life choices.",
            "The book was a quick read, easily finished in one sitting. However, its repetitive plot and lack of engaging developments in the latter half diminished my enjoyment.",
            "As a professional in the motion picture industry, I found this book captivating. It provides a unique insight into the production process of a reality TV show centered around haunted houses. The premise is engaging and drew me in right from the start."

        "conclusion": "This novella had an intriguing concept and well-rounded characters, but the repetitive plot and predictable twist made it a mediocre read for me. Despite its flaws, I still look forward to exploring more works by the author in the future.",

The concept was interesting and held my attention initially.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Mara, the protagonist, is well-developed and relatable. Her struggles with finding her place in the world, changing majors, and dealing with family mockery, especially from her cousin Jeremy, added depth to her character. Jeremy, the TV star, was also well-portrayed as someone who ignores Mara despite offering her a job. Jo, another production assistant, was a compelling yet intimidating figure who pushed Mara to question her life choices.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story started strong but became repetitive in the last third. Mara’s routine of scaring house inhabitants, returning to her motel, and eating with the crew felt like a Groundhog Day-like loop that bored me. The middle parts dragged with no intriguing incidents, and the twist in the mystery was too obvious.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Readability:**  \n  The book was a quick and easy read, finishing in one sitting. However, the repetitive nature of the plot and the lack of engaging developments in the latter part of the story diminished my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the concept and characterization were strong, the repetitive plot and predictable twist made it just an okay read for me. I didn’t enjoy it as much as I expected, especially compared to the author’s previous sci-fi works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella had an intriguing concept and well-rounded characters, but the repetitive plot and predictable twist made it a mediocre read for me. Despite its flaws, I still look forward to exploring more works by the author in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nMany thanks to NetGalley and Tor Publishing Group/Tordotcom for sharing this digital review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts."

            "The novel centers on Mara, who reluctantly takes a job as a production assistant for her cousin Jeremy's paranormal home show, *Haunt Sweet Home*. It effectively weaves together familiar tropes—newcomer at work, paranormal TV, family rivalries, and home renovations—creating an engaging narrative. While it begins with a vibe akin to Craig DiLouie’s *Episode Thirteen*, the story transitions into character-driven relational dynamics, delving into themes of family and identity.",
            "The story explores the complex relationships of its main characters, particularly Mara, and effectively employs black sheep tropes to illustrate how family and friends can pose challenges that rival even paranormal occurrences. The character interactions and dialogues are engaging, though I would have appreciated more depth in certain aspects.",
            "In *Haunt Sweet Home*, I appreciated the haunted house setting and on-location shooting. However, the story lingered too long at the motel. I would have preferred more scenes showcasing various haunted homes and the backstage drama of the show, which could have enriched the narrative.",

The character interactions and dialogue were compelling, though I wished for more depth in some areas.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  While I enjoyed the haunted house setting and the on-location shooting of *Haunt Sweet Home*, I felt the story spent too much time at the motel.

However, the writing style was extremely repetitive and felt like it dragged on, taking ages to get to the point.\n  \n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  I don’t think the audiobook was the best route for this story.

While its short length made it a quick read, the repetitive writing, robotic narration, and predictable twist left me feeling disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It avoids the tropes of unstoppable darkness or graphic violence, instead focusing on family drama and workplace challenges.  \n  - The story is cozy and leans more toward speculative fiction, with a mimetic fiction feel at the beginning.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The novella revolves around Mara, a thirty-something protagonist, who balances family dynamics and her job as a production assistant on a reality TV show about ghost hunters and home buyers.  \n  - The plot explores the tension between staged spookiness and genuine supernatural occurrences, as Mara encounters phenomena she didn’t orchestrate.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Mara is relatable, navigating the pressures of her job and her relationship with her more successful cousin, Jeremy, who hires her but then “ghosts” her.  \n  - The characters feel authentic, with their struggles and interactions driving the story.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The New England setting, with its dilapidated Victorian farmhouses and autumnal vibes, enhances the story’s mood.  \n  - The timing of reading the book in October, during the “spoopy season,” adds to its charm and relevance.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Sarah Pinsker’s writing is engaging and skillful, blending speculative elements with realistic fiction seamlessly.  \n  - The novella is well-crafted, maintaining a balance between the mundane and the supernatural.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Haunt Sweet Home* is a delightful and cozy ghost story that transcends traditional horror, focusing instead on family drama, workplace challenges, and the subtle interplay between reality and the supernatural. Sarah Pinsker’s skillful storytelling and the autumnal setting make it a perfect October read, though perhaps not one to enjoy alone in a creaky old house at midnight.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel revolves around a young woman who takes on a low-level job on a reality TV show that combines home remodeling with potential hauntings. She lands the role because her cousin is the show's star and because she struggles with figuring out her life's direction. The story follows her summer adventures, many of which involve creating hauntings for the show.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  As expected from Pinsker, the book is fun and engaging, even when simply observing the protagonist navigate her experiences. The narrative takes a turn into the strange, which aligns with Pinsker's self-described genre of \"weird stuff.\" While not frightening in a traditional sense, the story is unsettling in how the increasingly real hauntings mirror the main character's indecision and uncertainty, as well as her hidden talents.\n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel is thought-provoking, using the hauntings as a metaphor for the protagonist's internal struggles and her journey toward self-discovery. It explores themes of identity, uncertainty, and the intersection of reality and illusion.\n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  The book is enjoyable to read, offering a unique and quirky story that stands out. It balances humor, strangeness, and introspection, making it a memorable experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Pinsker novel is a fun, thought-provoking, and uniquely strange tale that uses hauntings as a metaphor for the protagonist's personal growth. While not traditionally scary, it is unsettling in its exploration of identity and uncertainty, all while maintaining an entertaining and engaging narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I didn’t expect outright horror based on the marketing, but I did anticipate the atmospheric storytelling Pinsker is known for in works like *Two Truths and a Lie* or *Signs of Life*. However, this story felt more aligned with John Wiswell’s style, where horror tropes serve character development rather than scares. While the setup was wonderful, the execution didn’t fully commit to either atmospheric horror or subverting genre expectations.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Pinsker effectively brings to life a protagonist from a put-together family who struggles to stick with any task. This dynamic, paired with the reality show vibe, was fascinating and engaging.\n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  The horror elements were introduced slowly, which left genre readers waiting for a payoff that never fully arrived. The slow build lacked tension and didn’t add much to the story, making the middle section feel wobbly and directionless.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Despite the uneven middle, the story starts strongly and comes together for a solid ending.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a strong start and a satisfying conclusion, it struggles to commit to either atmospheric horror or subverting genre expectations in the middle. The slow introduction of horror elements lacks tension, leaving the story feeling unbalanced. However, the characterization and setup remain highlights.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFirst impression: 15/20. Full review to come at www.tarvolon.com."

She was monotone and showed no feelings throughout the entire book, except for one moment of fear. While this might have been intentional to reflect her struggles in life, it didn’t work for me.  \n  - Cousin Jeremy was a jerk throughout, which aligned with how he was set up, but it didn’t make him likable.  \n  - Jo was a bit of a surprise, which was a positive note.  \n\n- **Storyline:**  \n  - The storyline didn’t engage me. It felt very repetitive, focusing on the same kind of events over and over.  \n  - The concept of a reality show about fixing up houses with ghosts sounded intriguing, but the execution fell flat for me.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  - I didn’t enjoy the narration. Mara’s monotone delivery made it hard to connect with her character.  \n  - I was surprised to learn there were multiple narrators, as I usually love full-cast narrations, but this one didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  - The story was very short, which was a positive, but it didn’t make up for the lack of engagement.  \n  - There were a few good moments and a couple of frights, but they weren’t enough to save the overall experience.  \n\n- **Originality:**  \n  - The take on the ‘how’s’ of reality TV was interesting, but it wasn’t enough to carry the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book didn’t work for me. While there were a few positives, such as the short length, a couple of frights, and an interesting take on reality TV, the repetitive storyline, unengaging characters, and monotone narration made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2 ⭐️⭐️  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nThanks to #NetGalley and #MacmillanAudio for providing an ARC of the audiobook in exchange for an honest review. #HauntSweetHome by Sarah Pinkser was released on 9/3/24."

However, it ended up emphasizing the behind-the-scenes staging of the scenes, which I wasn’t entirely surprised by but felt could have struck a better balance between creepy and technical elements.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main character had no personality. She seemed passive, letting life happen to her rather than taking control of her circumstances.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetitiveness:**  \n  The story started off okay, which is why I didn’t give it a 1-star rating. However, by the end, it became incredibly repetitive, which made the reading experience tedious.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  I was so bored while reading this and only finished it because it was a quick read. Overall, it was a letdown, and I didn’t enjoy it as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise, it failed to deliver on its potential. The lack of character depth, repetitive pacing, and imbalance between creepy and technical elements made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot a 1-star review, but significantly lower than expected due to boredom and lack of engagement."

At its heart, the narrative explores her stagnation and quest for personal growth. While some sections may feel slow and introspective, these moments enrich the character's development. Ultimately, Pinker has crafted an enchanting novella that skillfully combines introspection with a cozy, haunting ambiance.",

Up until the last third, I was having tons of fun watching Mara muddle through such a fun, unique job.\n\n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  The woodcarving thing seemed weirdly shoehorned in and super out of place. It only made a bit more sense when Jo was introduced, but even then, it didn’t feel fully integrated into the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  In the last third, Mara’s character took a turn for the worse. She went from being slightly surly and annoying to a jealous, obnoxious little brat. This shift was disappointing and didn’t align well with her earlier portrayal.\n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n  The family’s musical talent contrasted sharply with Mara’s inability to play, which felt like a missed opportunity for growth.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I felt like this was super slow. If I didn't have the ALC, I don't know if I would have finished this.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn't really vibe with the main character. She does have a lot that people can relate to, like feeling like a burden and not doing anything with her life, but she just didn't have much in the way of personality. Even the narrator didn't bring much life to the character.\n\n- **Narration and Audio Experience:**  \n  The best part of the ALC were the bits of dialogue from the show, and there were 4 narrators portraying the characters. Those bits were fun.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story is about Mara, who isn't doing much with her life and starts working as part of the crew on her uncle's TV show, *Haunting Sweet Home*. They renovate houses that turn out to be \"haunted,\" but the crew pretends it is for the show. While Mara is pretending to be a ghost, she encounters some real paranormal activity. There's more to it than that, and you have to read it to find out.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  It's a novella, so it's pretty short, and I definitely recommend that you pick this up if you're trying to read novellas to increase your books read for the year.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novella had an interesting premise and some enjoyable moments in the audio version, the slow pacing and lack of depth in the main character made it a less engaging read overall. The audio experience, particularly the dialogue and multiple narrators, was a highlight.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While Mara is relatable, especially for 20-something readers who are still figuring out their lives, I found her to be dull and boring most of the time. I wasn’t invested in her personal struggles and was more interested in the paranormal elements of the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot feels secondary to the character development, with the paranormal aspects only coming into play after the 70% mark. This was disappointing, as I was primarily looking forward to the spooky vibes and ghostly elements. Despite this, the book is a quick read, and I remained curious about how the paranormal part of the story would unfold.  \n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The paranormal scenes, which I was most excited about, were few and far between. The moments involving the reality TV show and its spooky setup were the highlights of the story, but they were not as frequent as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook features four narrators, but only one narrates the majority of the story, voicing Mara. While I didn’t particularly enjoy this narrator’s performance, finding it dull and boring, it did seem to match Mara’s personality. The other narrators, who appear in short chapters, delivered the best moments of the audio. Overall, I would still recommend the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novella had potential, it didn’t fully meet my expectations. The heavy focus on character development overshadowed the paranormal plot, which I found more intriguing.

            "In her role as a non-union production assistant on the night crew, Mara finds herself at the bottom of the hierarchy, tasked with the most tedious and uncomfortable duties. However, when a floater from the day crew starts to help her, Mara begins to question the true nature of her surroundings. While the show may be creating ghosts for its audience, could some of them actually be real? I was particularly unconvinced by the convoluted twist surrounding the library haunting, especially once the owners learned about Mara's involvement. Nevertheless, the fact that at least one reveal wasn't aired helps maintain the show's façade.",
            "Mara stands out as the odd duck among her overbearing, high-achieving family. Despite being in her twenties, she struggles to find her path in life. I really enjoyed this ghost story, largely due to my sympathy for Mara. Her family's treatment of her is disheartening, particularly when her new friend Jo accuses her of not appreciating her situation. While I recognize that being part of a vibrant, artistic family can be a gift, the reality is that Mara is largely mistreated by them. The exception is Oma, and even then, Mara’s feelings of sadness are understandable. It's frustrating to see how some families, especially in an American context, can treat parenthood like a temporary obligation that ends at eighteen. Why is it that not everyone looks out for one another, particularly within families?",
            "I appreciated the tentative exploration of what it means to create art and the fusion of artist and creation. While it wasn't fully developed, I sensed a foundation for something great that the author can build upon in future stories.",
            "I'm puzzled as to why Tordotcom, known for its speculative fiction, published this novella instead of its horror imprint, Nightfire, which released the similarly eerie *Crypt of the Moon Spider*. Nevertheless, I'm thrilled this novella is now available as a standalone book, making it an ideal quick read as the cold and dark of winter sets in here in downcounty Maryland."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I found Haunt Sweet Home to be an enjoyable ghost story, primarily due to my connection with Mara and her struggles. While some plot twists were unconvincing, the exploration of art and creation was intriguing. It may not be the author's best work, but it's a great read for the fall season.",

Her family sucked.\n  - It was weird for me because there's a moment where Mara's new friend Jo accuses her of not appreciating what she has, and while I understand that having a big, cheerful, artistic/musical family can be a blessing, her family members all treat Mara pretty poorly.\n  - The main exception is Oma, and even there Mara's sadness is perfectly justified.\n  - While I get that not everyone in a clan can look out for each other -- and cousins can definitely be the worst, especially when they're in a pack -- her parents are especially crappy in that American way I've never understood.\n  - Why do some people treat parenthood like a reverse custodial sentence that ends at eighteen years?\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n  - As a non-union production assistant on the night crew, Mara is at the very bottom of the pecking order, so is given the most uncomfortable and annoying tasks.\n  - But when a floater from the day crew starts tagging along to help her out, Mara starts to question what's really going on around her. The show might be manufacturing ghosts for its viewers, but could some of those ghosts end up being real?\n  - I was also unconvinced by the double (triple?) twist of the library haunting, especially when the owners found out about Mara's role in it.\n  - I suppose since at least one reveal wasn't televised, that keeps the show's fraudulence secret.\n  - I did like the tentative exploration of what it means to make art, of the fusion of artist with creation. While I don't think it was perfectly dealt with here, it did feel like the seed of something great for Sarah Pinsker to keep working on in following stories.\n\n- **Author's Previous Works and Comparison:**\n  - I've really enjoyed most of her other Hugo-nominated works to date, and while Haunt Sweet Home isn't quite as up there in my estimation as Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather or Two Truths And A Lie, it's still a great book to cozy up with as fall works its way into the year.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I found Haunt Sweet Home to be an enjoyable ghost story, primarily due to my connection with Mara and her struggles. While some plot twists were unconvincing, the exploration of art and creation was intriguing. It may not be Sarah Pinsker's best work, but it's a great read for the fall season.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 stars rounded up."

The detailed descriptions of reality TV production add credibility to the narrative.  \n  - **Complex Character Development:**  \n    Mara's journey from feeling like a \"spare part\" in her family to discovering her artistic voice through woodcarving is beautifully rendered. Her relationship with her grandmother, a renowned wood sculptor, adds depth to her character arc.  \n  - **Thematic Resonance:**  \n    The novella thoughtfully explores themes of identity, family legacy, and artistic expression.

Hearing her read from the book immediately made me want to read it.  \n  - This experience inspired me to attend more book/author events in the future, as I wouldn’t have discovered this book otherwise.  \n\n- **Pricing and Accessibility:**  \n  - I found it hard to justify spending almost $20 on a book under 200 pages, so I borrowed it from the library instead.  \n  - I was pleasantly surprised that the physical hardcover was available the next day, even though the e-book had a waitlist.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The book follows Mara, a twenty-something struggling to find her place in the world and in her family. After dropping out of college, she takes a job as a production assistant on her cousin’s haunted home renovation show.  \n  - The premise intrigued me because I love ghost shows (like my mom) and home makeover shows. I also connect with stories about young women navigating their twenties.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I wanted to like Mara more, but she came across as a bit spoiled and lacked a backbone, which made it hard to fully connect with her.  \n\n- **Twist and World-Building:**  \n  - The big twist at the end felt lackluster, and I’m still confused about how ghosts work in this universe.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - While I liked the book, I didn’t love it as much as I expected. It’s a short, enjoyable read perfect for getting into the Halloween season—it’s not scary but has some creepiness, drama, and themes of self-doubt.  \n  - Despite my mixed feelings, I’m excited to explore more of Sarah Pinsker’s works in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Haunt Sweet Home* is a short, engaging read with a unique premise that blends ghost stories, reality TV drama, and themes of self-discovery. While I didn’t love it as much as I hoped due to some underwhelming elements, it introduced me to Sarah Pinsker’s writing and inspired me to attend more book events.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 ⭐️"

Although I anticipated the major twist early on, it didn’t diminish my enjoyment. However, the ending felt somewhat underwhelming, and the novel's length affected its overall impact.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Mara is a relatable protagonist who feels lost and unsatisfied in her personal life, struggling with commitment and feeling invisible to her family.  \n  - I identified strongly with Mara, especially as the youngest grandchild who often feels out of place in my extended family.  \n  - The connection to Mara’s grandmother, who is known for her carvings, added a personal touch that resonated with me.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The premise of Mara working on a haunted house renovation TV show is intriguing and unique.  \n  - The story is fast-paced and engaging, with Mara orchestrating the “hauntings” while dealing with increasingly frightening events beyond her control.  \n  - While I figured out the major twist early on, it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the story.  \n  - The ending felt a bit underwhelming, and the length of the novel impacted its potential. It could have been stronger as either a condensed short story or an expanded novel, as some aspects felt repetitive while others were underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  - The atmosphere of the “hauntings” was vividly built, allowing me to easily picture each scene in my mind.  \n  - The concept of a haunted house renovation show was so compelling that I would love to watch something like it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This is a fun, fast, and spooky read, perfect for the Halloween season.  \n  - Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed this “weird little book” and found it to be an entertaining experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is an engaging and atmospheric read with a relatable protagonist and a unique premise. While the ending and pacing could have been stronger, it remains a fun and spooky story that I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned, but the reviewer implies a rating of around 4 stars, noting that the length and ending prevented it from being a 5-star read."

The idea of staging hauntings was enjoyable and had a cozy feel, though I wished for more excitement and drama.

            "The story's brevity is a strength; any longer, and it might have overstayed its welcome. The length feels just right for the narrative.",
            "This novella shares similarities with *Two Truths and a Lie*, particularly in its portrayal of a young woman who feels disconnected from her life and family, lacking her own dreams and future. However, *Two Truths and a Lie* is far spookier, evoking a creepypasta vibe where the familiar becomes unsettling, leaving a persistent itch in the back of your mind. In contrast, *Haunt Sweet Home* feels more commercial, offering clearer explanations, a defined moral, and a neatly wrapped-up ending. It’s a quick read that stays on the lighter side of creepy, leaving no lingering questions behind.",
            "One of my favorite sci-fi novels is *We Are Satellites*, but I hadn't explored more of the author's work until now. Upon starting this novella, I discovered I had previously added her short story *Two Truths and a Lie* to my TBR list. I decided to read that first."

As soon as I started this novella, I went searching through my Goodreads and found I’d added another work of hers, *Two Truths and a Lie*, to my TBR. I decided to read that short story first.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  While there are similar threads between this novella and *Two Truths and a Lie*, such as a young woman feeling disconnected from her life and family, with no future or dreams of her own, *Two Truths and a Lie* is much spookier. It has a creepypasta feel where everything is familiar and recognizable but just off enough to leave you feeling unsettled, with a persistent itch in the back of your brain. In contrast, *Haunt Sweet Home* feels like a more commercial cousin, delivering more explanation, a clearer moral, and a neatly tied-up ending. It’s a quick jaunt that never strays too creepy and doesn’t leave any lingering questions.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The story is short, which works in its favor. I imagine it would have started to overstay its welcome if it were longer, even though the length felt fitting for the narrative.\n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The narrator had a noticeably flat affectation and a fair amount of vocal fry, which I think is appropriate for this sort of disaffected character. However, I’m glad the story was brief, as the narration style might have become grating over a longer duration.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to Macmillan Audio for providing me with an audio ARC. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Haunt Sweet Home* is an enjoyable and quick read with a neatly resolved ending, it lacks the unsettling depth and spookiness of Pinsker’s *Two Truths and a Lie*.

I have no idea who played which role because Macmillan Audio didn’t list them in the credits. However, I can say that Ms. Nahikian is the main narrator. Her voice register is not conducive to my hearing loss, and her lowest registers (usually at the end of almost every sentence) were difficult for me to hear. Maybe someone at Macmillan Audio could assist Ms. Nahikian in learning to keep her sentences from dipping so low at the ends, so that people like me can understand her without having to turn up their devices or use headphones. Otherwise, she was perfect for this role, as were all the other narrators for this audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel enjoyable and engaging, with a strong desire for it to become a series.

            "The story's direction could have been more impactful if it had explored the dynamic between real and fake hauntings more deeply. A doppelganger subplot might have added further complexity.

At its core, *Haunt Sweet Home* follows Mara as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery while working on a home makeover/haunting reality show. The concept of blending real hauntings with staged ones is intriguing, yet the narrative missed the mark by shifting focus to a less compelling haunted library episode. This diversion detracted from the potential of the original premise.",

This misclassification affected my enjoyment of the book.\n\n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The core of *Haunt Sweet Home* revolves around the protagonist, Mara, trying to figure out herself and what she wants out of life. This self-discovery happens through her experience working on a home makeover/haunting reality show. The concept of a show where real hauntings occur while they orchestrate fake ones is a great idea.

Instead, it shifted to an episode about a \"haunted library,\" which felt less impactful.\n\n- **Direction and Execution:**  \n  The direction of the story could have been more meaningful if it had leaned into the real vs. fake haunting dynamic. I even think a doppelganger route could have added depth. The ending felt anti-climactic and underwhelming, though I understand it might align with the literary fiction genre rather than horror. Still, it didn’t work for me.\n\n- **Potential and Length:**  \n  I believe the story had potential but fell short.

While the dynamic between them had potential, it didn’t feel fully developed or convincing.  \n\n- **Setting and Job Role:**  \n  Mara’s job as a production assistant faking hauntings sounded fascinating, but she treated it like it was the worst thing ever, which was a bit frustrating. The setup was interesting, but it needed more depth to truly stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had an intriguing premise and an interesting setup, but it fell short in execution. The main character was hard to connect with, the plot felt surface-level, and the emotional beats didn’t fully land. While it was a quick and easy read, it lacked the depth and wow factor to make it truly memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The show involves buying supposedly haunted houses and giving them makeovers, though the hauntings are staged. Mara’s role is to spook the owners. She meets Jo, who helps her out, but it’s later revealed that Jo is a ghost from one of the properties. Jo comes to life through a sculpture Mara made from an apple tree on the property. Despite initially considering destroying the sculpture, Mara decides to keep it due to her bond with Jo.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book didn’t feel much like a horror novel, aside from the obvious TV show hauntings. The tone was more bland than chilling or suspenseful.\n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  The twist involving Jo being a ghost was predictable from the start, which made the story feel less engaging.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mara is relatable as an aimless 20-something, and her bond with Jo adds some emotional depth. However, the characters and their interactions didn’t stand out as particularly compelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was okay but lacked the depth and suspense expected from a horror novel. The predictable twist and bland tone made it a somewhat underwhelming read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nGrade: D"

Each narrator did a wonderful job at bringing more life and personality to their characters and the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Haunt Sweet Home* had some positive aspects, such as an engaging start, a well-developed main character, and excellent audiobook narration, the repetitive events and underdeveloped supporting characters made it a miss for me overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

But soon enough (unsurprisingly), some of the spooky activity doesn't seem to be faked.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The main focus of the book is really Mara's self-discovery, introspection, and growth as a person. However, the level of her ignorance as portrayed by the author sometimes feels more believable for a 16-year-old than a twenty-something.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While the story has a spooky horror element, it really takes a backseat to the themes of self-discovery and personal growth, which was a bit disappointing at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was a light read with a focus on character development and self-discovery, though the horror elements were underutilized. While it didn’t live up to the expectations set by Pinsker’s previous work, it was still an enjoyable story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She drifts through life until her telegenic cousin helps her land a job as a gofer on the crew. Working the night shift, Mara assists in staging the hauntings.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Premise:** The novel is an amusing, lightly spooky tale about a young woman, Mara, who works for a home renovation TV show where homeowners discover their houses are haunted—or perhaps the eerie happenings are orchestrated by the TV crew. Mara’s job involves staging these hauntings, which adds an intriguing twist to the story.\n- **Character Development:** Mara is a relatable protagonist who has always felt out of place, even within her large extended family. Her contentment with playing \"ghost\" is challenged when an odd new co-worker prompts her to question her actions and her role in her own life. The author, Sarah Pinsker, skillfully brings Mara and the supporting characters to life, making them memorable and engaging.\n- **Emotional Depth:** The novella is unexpectedly touching, blending ghostly elements with a deeper exploration of Mara’s personal journey and self-discovery.\n- **Writing Style:** The author’s writing is effective in creating a balance between humor, spookiness, and emotional resonance, making the story both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novella is a delightful blend of humor, light spookiness, and emotional depth. Mara’s journey of self-discovery, combined with the unique premise of staged hauntings, makes for a compelling and touching read.

            "The story was only mediocre for me. While it aimed to explore the main character's journey of self-discovery rather than focusing on a haunted house, this shift diluted the horror element. The lack of emphasis on the hauntings left the narrative feeling flat. Additionally, the pacing felt disjointed; the plot introduced the show, hinted at paranormal activity, and then rushed to a quick conclusion. This structure hindered the buildup of anxiety and dread, ultimately undermining the story's impact."

Her voice fit perfectly for our main character, sounding consistently apathetic and a bit irritable, which I thought was ideal for the role.\n\n- **Story Concept and Execution:**  \n  The overall story was only okay for me. It wasn’t truly about a haunted house but rather about the main character finding herself. While that’s fine, it made the story feel middle of the road because there wasn’t enough focus on the hauntings, and it didn’t fully deliver on the horror element.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt off to me. The story unfolded in a way that felt disjointed: we’d learn about the show, get a hint of something paranormal, and then rush to a quick conclusion. This structure didn’t allow for much buildup of anxiety or dread.\n\n- **Stakes and Tension:**  \n  There didn’t seem to be any real stakes in the story. The lack of focus on the haunting and the absence of a sense of danger or urgency made it hard to feel invested in the paranormal aspects.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narration was excellent and perfectly suited to the main character, the story itself fell short for me. It leaned more into self-discovery than horror, and the pacing and lack of stakes made it feel underwhelming as a haunted house tale.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

For the first two-thirds of the book, I was unsure where the story was heading, but looking back, most of the clues were there.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  It took Mara, the protagonist, a while to come around, but her journey felt authentic and well-paced.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is ultimately satisfying and ties the story together nicely.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  This is a lovely book that kept me engaged.

It’s a great choice for a quick, easy read, especially during the spooky season.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley, I listened to the audiobook, which was fantastic overall. However, I found the main female narrator’s voice a bit gruff for my liking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its predictability, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its engaging horror/paranormal atmosphere and its suitability as a quick, seasonal read. The audiobook was a great experience, though the narrator’s voice wasn’t entirely to my taste.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the short length kept me engaged, and the satisfying ending ultimately redeemed the experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The cover also caught my interest, and I was initially intrigued by the setup of the show and the main character, Mara, who is in her 30s and trying to figure out her life and what she wants to do.\n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  I really enjoyed the family dynamics at play, particularly how Mara’s family judges her and compares her to her more successful relatives. This felt like a good setup for a character to root for.\n\n- **Execution of the Haunting Concept:**  \n  My biggest issue with this novel is that I don’t really understand the haunting concept involved. I wish the story had been longer so that aspect could have been more fleshed out. As a novella, it felt rushed, and the haunting aspect seemed like an afterthought to the TV show premise. As someone who was here for the ghosts, I was left feeling disappointed.\n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**  \n  Even though the book was short, parts of it felt slow, dragged out, and repetitive. I understand the repetition was meant to reflect the life of working on a production set, but it became tedious to read. With other parts of the story needing more attention, I felt frustrated by the pacing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and character dynamics had potential, the execution of the haunting concept fell flat, and the pacing issues left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. The novella format didn’t allow enough room to fully explore the intriguing ideas it introduced.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The writing made this such an easy read, and it's pretty short, so I flew through it.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Mara is such an interesting and relatable character. Her being the narrator gives the story a more somber tone, as Mara doesn't have the best outlook on life or really anything. She's struggling to find her way in life and feels like she's being judged by her family—something many people in their 20s can relate to. When her cousin offers her a job on his very successful reality show *Haunt Sweet Home*, she decides to take it as she isn't doing anything else. She falls into the job well and even gets a little bit of help.\n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the family dynamic of Mara's family and how it propels Mara into her decision to join the show.\n\n- **Supernatural Elements:**  \n  As they move from location to location, we start to question if there's a supernatural element surrounding Mara. The haunts are a bit more lighthearted than scary in my opinion, but there is a very creepy factor to the whole story, both in regards to the show itself and the story as a whole.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel was an engaging and enjoyable read with a relatable protagonist, intriguing family dynamics, and a mix of lighthearted and creepy supernatural elements.

Furthermore, some sections felt redundant, which was frustrating given the novella's limited length.",

The idea of staging haunted houses for a fake show, only for the Haunter to become Haunted, was intriguing and engaging.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Development:**  \n  I didn’t really believe the motivations or needs of the main character. It felt unrealistic that it took her so long to figure out what was going on, which made her actions less convincing.  \n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n  While I enjoyed the transition from fake hauntings to real ones, the \"rules\" for the ghosts in the story didn’t make sense. I had too many unanswered questions about what was happening, which made it hard to stay invested in the plot.  \n\n- **Twists and Pacing:**  \n  The midpoint twist felt random, and the main twist was clumsy and hard to follow. Additionally, there were some redundant sections, which was frustrating given the limited space of a novella.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The novella had a lot of potential, but the execution was frustrating. The creative premise was overshadowed by issues with character development, plot coherence, and pacing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novella’s premise was creative and fun, its execution fell short due to unconvincing character motivations, unclear ghost rules, random twists, and redundant sections. It had potential but ultimately left me frustrated.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟2/5🌟  \n\nThank you @macmillan.audio for sending me this Audiobook in exchange for an honest review!"
