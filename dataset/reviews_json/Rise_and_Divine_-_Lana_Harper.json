It felt like a fitting conclusion to the series, and I appreciated how it tied everything together.  \n\n- **Character Development (Dasha):**  \n  This book follows Dasha, a witch whose lineage means she’s both Harlowe and Avmarov. Her dual heritage adds depth to her character, and her role as a death eater who feels the pull of the other side creates an intriguing internal conflict.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n  The story plays well on the dark vs. light conflict, which is a central theme throughout the book. This duality adds tension and keeps the narrative engaging.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance in this book is a bit more spicy than in the most recent books, and that’s a good thing! It adds an extra layer of excitement and emotional depth to the story.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to NetGalley for providing an ARC of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a strong and satisfying conclusion to the series, with well-developed characters, engaging themes, and a touch of spice in the romance. It’s a great read for fans of the series and a fitting farewell to the Witches of Thistle Grove.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Dasha's focus on reclaiming Ivy quickly shifted upon her return, creating a sense of inconsistency that felt unsatisfying. The narrative seemed more concerned with meeting a word count than crafting a compelling story, especially when compared to the immersive quality of *Payback’s a Witch*.",
            "The romance in *Rise and Divine* fell short compared to previous works, coming across as underdeveloped and not emphasized enough for a genre focused on romance. The reconciliation between Dasha and Ivy felt rushed and unearned, with their relationship transitioning from minimal contact to a steamy reunion without adequate buildup. Additionally, the chemistry between Dasha and the male demon overshadowed the sapphic romance, which was disappointing. While I appreciated the metaphor of the demon's attraction representing suicidal ideation, it ultimately detracted from the central romance.",
            "The writing style of *Rise and Divine* made it a challenging read. In contrast to *Payback’s a Witch*, which featured vivid imagery and sensory details, this book felt repetitive and lacked the same evocative quality. The excessive use of figurative language, particularly similes beginning with \"like,\" was distracting and often unnecessary. Many comparisons felt redundant, disrupting the narrative flow. For instance: \n\n- “Her eyes had flashed mutinously between the two of us like a rebellious teen.”\n- “Trapped between the lightning strikes like prison bars.”\n- “[The demon] paused, the smile dropping away like a husk, an awful darkness falling like a curtain across his face.”\n- “His flawless face intoxicating and deathly as a draught of some hemlock-touched wine, those green eyes bright like emeralds. A smile curling the corners of his lips, one hand outstretched to me like a cavalier’s.” \n\nOverall, the overabundance of such comparisons detracted from the story's impact."

The underdeveloped romance, repetitive writing style, and lack of focus made it a disappointing read. While there were a few standout moments, they weren’t enough to salvage the book. This experience has made me eager to revisit *Payback’s a Witch* instead.",

            "In this story, the romance between Dasha and Ivy takes a backseat, deviating from the tension-filled relationships typical in previous books. Their connection develops quickly and easily, which may disappoint readers seeking more dramatic buildup. Ivy Thorn is a standout character—both caring and strong—and it was gratifying to see her evolve from a supporting role to a love interest. Dasha, on the other hand, is a deeply damaged character whose struggles are sensitively portrayed, particularly her flirtation with self-destructive behaviors, likened to an addiction. It was also refreshing to see multiple intimate scenes within a sapphic pairing. However, I noticed a recurring theme of queer women navigating exceptions or nuances in their preferences. While not inherently problematic, this pattern felt somewhat overemphasized.",

This might not appeal to everyone.  \n   - The emotional weight of Dasha's journey is well-handled, and I felt the gravity of what she had to go through.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics**  \n   - The romance between Dasha and Ivy isn't the sole driving force of the story, unlike in previous books. They get together quickly and easily, which might not satisfy readers looking for more tension.  \n   - Ivy Thorn is a wonderful character—caring yet strong—and I loved seeing her transition from a supporting character to a love interest.  \n   - Dasha's character is deeply damaged, and her struggles are explored sensitively, particularly her flirtation with self-destructive tendencies, which is treated like an addiction.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery**  \n   - The mystery element isn't particularly complex, but it's presented in an interesting way.  \n   - The climax of the challenge is stronger than in previous books, and I appreciated how the town came together to help.  \n\n- **Representation and Writing Choices**  \n   - It was refreshing to see more than one sex scene within a sapphic pairing.  \n   - I noticed a recurring theme in the series where queer women who prefer women are described as having exceptions or nuances in their preferences.

            "The novel features a gripping climax that stands out, although it’s challenging to compare it to the first, which lacked a defined climax. While the deus ex machina resolution at the end feels somewhat simplistic, it ultimately serves the story well.",
            "This story features two well-developed protagonists: Ivy, who is delightful, balanced, and unexpectedly sensual, and Dasha, who grapples with intense and realistic issues. The novel tackles addiction in a fresh and engaging manner, highlighting its effects on loved ones without becoming overly heavy-handed. However, the romance feels somewhat basic, as the characters overcome their challenges too easily, making Dasha’s romantic redemption feel unearned. Fortunately, other plotlines enrich the narrative. Additionally, the explanation behind the conflict between Ivy and Dasha falls short of the intensity hinted at in the previous novel, although it acknowledges the complexity of emotions.",
            "This novel offers an expansive exploration of Thistle Grove, its characters, lore, and fantasy elements. It shines brightest when immersing readers in its incredible setting, which is effectively highlighted throughout the story.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and consider it one of the best I've read. Thistle Grove is one of my favorite fictional settings, and any story set there automatically earns my approval. Despite some inconsistencies in the series, I highly recommend it for its unique and captivating charm. For the best experience, it's essential to read the series in order. This novel masterfully hits all the emotional notes, featuring scenes that are funny, sad, serious, tense, and heartwarming. It tackles serious themes with a dark tone while maintaining a surprisingly \"human\" quality, even within a fantasy context. The emotional depth it evokes makes it one of the most satisfying reads I've encountered."

However, the romance, particularly the second-chance relationship between Dasha and Ivy, felt rushed and lacked depth. I struggled to connect with their story, as the longing typically present in romances was absent. One moment they were apart, and the next they were back together, which felt unconvincing. Additionally, Ivy's character felt underdeveloped, making it difficult to invest in their relationship.",

The world remains the highlight of the series, and I’m genuinely saddened to see it come to an end."

While I enjoy second chance romances, I need to feel invested in both the couple's past and their present. Here, I sensed the potential but found the \"before\" lacking clarity.

            "This book centers on Daria (Dasha) Avramov and Ivy Thorn as they rekindle their romance while working to save Thistle Grove. Dasha's perspective dominates the narrative, with early chapters focusing on her past and establishing suspense. Ivy is introduced late in the story (at 17%), which disrupts the pacing and limits the depth of their relationship. The second-chance romance trope feels underdeveloped, primarily due to the single POV and absence of flashbacks that could have provided more context. While their physical connection develops quickly, influenced by extenuating circumstances, the emotional depth is lacking. The potential for a rich romance between Dasha and Ivy exists but ultimately feels unfulfilled, making it hard to fully invest in their happily-ever-after. Additionally, the single POV and Ivy's late introduction hinder the emotional connection compared to previous pairings.",
            "I will always cherish the enchanting, queer, and idyllic world the author has crafted. Thistle Grove continues to be a beloved and atmospheric setting, brought to life by the author's cozy and immersive writing style.",
            "This book delves into profound themes such as addiction, depression, grief, and suicidal ideation. Dasha's journey as a devil eater, her struggle with the addiction to transcending the veil, and her path to recovery are central to the narrative. The tone is notably darker and more intense than in previous installments, which may not resonate with readers anticipating a lighter, romance-focused conclusion."

The heavy themes and underdeveloped romance left me wanting more, particularly in terms of closure and emotional satisfaction.

            "The demon problem introduces an intriguing layer of conflict, intricately linked to the history of Thistle Grove and the goddess Belisama. Dasha, as a devil eater with a connection to the veil, is uniquely positioned to confront the demon threat, even as she defies orders to stay away. Although the identity of the demon's summoner was somewhat predictable, the witchy elements and historical revelations kept me thoroughly engaged.",
            "The sapphic romance between Dasha Avramov and Ivy Thorn is both heartfelt and compelling, anchored by Dasha’s grief and Ivy’s hesitance to rekindle their relationship. Dasha’s journey through her sorrow and her gradual willingness to let Ivy back into her life is beautifully depicted, even if their reconciliation occasionally feels rushed. Ivy’s grounded nature and life magic serve as a perfect counterbalance to Dasha, creating a dynamic and believable pairing. Their chemistry and genuine desire to be together are standout elements of the book. \n\nAs the narrator, Dasha offers a profound exploration of her emotions, struggles, and inner strength. Her grief is palpable, yet her resilience makes her a compelling protagonist. Ivy, while almost too perfect, aligns well with her family’s traits, and her love and stability complement Dasha’s complexity. The supporting characters, including the enigmatic young woman by the lake, enrich the narrative, though I wished for more development of some familiar faces. Overall, their relationship is a highlight of the story.",

The month-long festivities honor the four founding families and their connection to the goddess Belisama, creating a rich backdrop for the narrative. The book expands the world by showcasing the families' abilities and the community's evolution over the years. While I appreciated the emphasis on all four families, I felt that some previous characters were underutilized, and one family in particular warranted more attention.",
            "This book delves into themes of grief, healing, and community, with Dasha's personal journey as the emotional core. The intertwining of magic and history leads to a bittersweet yet satisfying conclusion. Lighthearted moments effectively balance the heavier themes, resulting in a story that is both heartwarming and poignant."

Dasha and Ivy’s relationship is a standout, and the blend of romance, magic, and history makes this a memorable read.

            "Dasha’s character is complex but ultimately stagnant, grappling with unresolved issues without experiencing significant growth. While I empathized with her struggles, her inability to work through her traumas left me questioning the future of her relationship with Ivy. Ivy, in contrast, felt underdeveloped and was largely relegated to a love interest role. We learned little about her life or her unresolved conflict with her sister, which diminished the credibility of their romance. The dynamic between Dasha and Ivy felt forced, as their interactions appeared obligatory rather than organic, lacking the tension and passion needed for a convincing relationship. I found myself thinking that Dasha might have been better suited with Maya, while Ivy deserved a partner who truly matched her.",
            "This book showcases excellent writing, featuring fluid and consistent prose. The pacing is superb, and although there are numerous descriptions, they enhance rather than detract from the reading experience. Overall, the writing stands out as one of the book's strongest aspects.",
            "The concept of a god invading the city and Dasha's descent into the Other World was both intriguing and well-executed. As a Devil Eater, Dasha introduced a unique form of magic that enriched the universe. I particularly appreciated the themes of grief and found family, especially in Dasha's relationships with her sister and stepmother. However, I was disappointed by their absence at the end, as family plays a crucial role in the story."

However, I struggled to connect with the story and characters, particularly due to the underdeveloped romance and Ivy’s lack of depth. While the writing was strong, the emotional engagement and character growth fell short for me. Despite this, I still recommend it to fans, as it continues to expand the universe and offers an adventurous storyline.",

I felt like I had to force myself to read it, and it took me an unusually long time to finish, even though it’s only 300 pages. I even read other books in between to try to get hooked, which I never do.\n   - Despite the slow pace, which I expected in a romance, I didn’t feel bored or stuck in a repetitive spiral. The story evolved, and it was the most epic and adventurous in the series, with a greater focus on the plot than the romance.\n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**\n   - The concept of a god invading the city and Dasha being consumed by the \"Other World\" was intriguing and well-executed. As a Devil Eater, Dasha introduced a new type of magic, which expanded the universe and made it more developed.\n   - I appreciated the themes of grief and found family, especially Dasha’s relationship with her sister and stepmother. However, I was disappointed that they weren’t present at the end, as family is important too.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Dasha’s character was complex, with many unresolved issues. While I understood her struggles, I felt she didn’t grow much throughout the book. Instead of healing, she seemed to confront her traumas without working through them, which made me doubt the future of her relationship with Ivy.\n   - Ivy, on the other hand, felt underdeveloped. She was reduced to a love interest, and we learned almost nothing about her life or her conflict with her sister, which was never resolved. This lack of depth made it hard to believe in the romance.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance between Dasha and Ivy felt forced. Their scenes together seemed included out of obligation rather than natural progression. I didn’t feel any tension or passion between them, and their relationship didn’t feel convincing or satisfying.\n   - I even thought Dasha might have been better suited with Maya, and Ivy deserved someone more compatible.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The book was well-written, with fluid and consistent prose. The pacing of the chapters was excellent, and while there were many descriptions, they didn’t bother me. The writing was one of the stronger aspects of the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book had a lot of potential with its intriguing world-building, epic plot, and complex themes. However, I struggled to connect with the story and characters, particularly due to the underdeveloped romance and Ivy’s lack of depth. While the writing was strong, the emotional engagement and character growth fell short for me.

This results in an uneven narrative, marked by unnecessary digressions on pleasing fictional characters. Consequently, the characters' choices—such as dismissing magical dangers or abandoning a traumatized stranger—come across as foolish, undermining the reader's intelligence.

            "This final installment wraps up the story effectively, delivering a satisfying conclusion. The eventful finale showcases a well-crafted blend of magic and collaboration among the families, leaving no room for further development. The engaging plot weaves together themes of possession, divine visitations, mysteries, and festival events, all rooted in the classic magics of Thistle Grove. Central to the narrative is the clash between primordial forces of creation and destruction, which sheds light on previously unanswered questions about the town and its magic. The exploration of opposing gods and forces is both intriguing and humanizing, offering a fresh take on divine mythology.",
            "The romance between Dasha and Ivy is solid, showcasing a clear and strong connection, though it feels less robust than in previous installments. Their on-again/off-again history leaves some on-page development lacking, relying more on their established bond than on new vulnerabilities. The spicy scenes are smooth and enjoyable, benefiting from the absence of awkwardness. Dasha’s personal journey, including her struggles after her parents’ deaths and her role as a devil eater, adds depth to her character. While the rekindling of sparks between Dasha and Ivy isn't as deeply developed as in earlier books, it still feels genuine and fitting.",

The thematic exploration of divine forces, coupled with a focus on humanity's complexity, adds a unique and thought-provoking layer to the narrative.",

            "This story can be classified as a second-chance romance, but the rekindling of Dasha and Ivy's old flame happens rather swiftly. From the outset, we learn about their previous breakup and how Dasha self-sabotaged their relationship. I expected more conflict before Ivy decided to reconcile, but she seems to trust Dasha again surprisingly quickly. I would have appreciated more effort on Dasha's part to demonstrate her growth to Ivy—and to the readers. However, the chemistry between them is undeniable, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them navigate their path to happiness.",
            "This story is much more introspective than previous entries in the Thistle Grove series. Dasha’s grief over the loss of both her parents significantly shapes her journey of self-discovery. Her inner monologues are rich with profound reflections on family, identity, and love. The author addresses these sensitive themes with respect and realism, evoking deep sympathy for Dasha's experience.",

            "The monthlong founding celebration of Thistle Grove, held only every twenty years, adds a unique and engaging backdrop to the story, especially with the added intrigue of the mysterious turbulence on Lady’s Lake.",
            "The relationship between Dasha and Ivy is complex and tense, marked by unresolved feelings from past heartbreaks. Dasha's commitment to self-improvement in order to be worthy of Ivy adds depth to her character. However, the resolution of their relationship feels somewhat rushed and overly tidy, which is disappointing considering the depth of their initial conflict.",
            "The book's standout feature is its imaginative expansion of magic and lore. Thistle Grove comes alive with a sense of authenticity that surpasses previous stories. The Avramovs' powers have chilling real-world implications, and the magic continues to surprise, even in a town established by witches.",
            "Dasha's battles with grief and her addiction to her magical ability to cross the veil infuse the story with emotional depth. The narrative delves into how past mistakes and unresolved trauma linger, demanding healing. It serves as a poignant analogy for addiction recovery, illustrating the challenges and consequences of Dasha's choices."

            "The final book brings closure to the overarching narrative of demons and death. While I thoroughly enjoyed the series and the town of Thistle Grove, I felt that the characters deserved more resolution, likely due to my reluctance to leave this captivating world. The story effectively ties together longstanding adventures, with mysterious events linking back to earlier plots. New characters, such as an amnesiac human discovered by the lake, inject intrigue into Dasha’s journey as she confronts both literal and metaphorical demons. The exploration of Dasha’s magic and the underworld is compelling and enriches the world-building, making for a satisfying conclusion.",
            "The romance between Dasha and Ivy is satisfying, although I felt Dasha's redemption arc could have been more challenging. While the steamy scenes are well-written, the romance lacks the tension I expected for a second/third chance love story. This book, which centers on Dasha and Ivy—characters from previous installments—delves into Dasha's struggles as a demon eater and her desire to remain in the underworld after her parents' death. The nuanced exploration of Dasha's depression and her aversion to the living world adds depth, making this the darkest installment in the series.",
            "This book explores profound themes such as death, depression, and survival with sensitivity and a strong emphasis on community support. While it takes on a darker, more introspective tone, it still retains the cozy, witchy atmosphere that fans love."

        "conclusion": "*Rise and Divine* is a satisfying conclusion, blending romance, mystery, and dark themes with a cozy, witchy atmosphere that fans will love. While I wanted more closure for the characters and a more challenging romance arc, the book excels in its exploration of Dasha’s struggles and the rich world-building. It’s a must-read for fans and a great choice for anyone seeking a witchy, emotional, and steamy story.",

            "The book concludes satisfactorily, but a thorough understanding of the previous four installments is essential for full appreciation. While the love story is central, it never dominates the narrative, avoiding clichés and allowing the broader problem-solving elements to enrich the romantic moments. The resolution, which sees the four witch families collaborating, feels both organic and in line with established lore. However, the plot remains predictable, particularly for readers familiar with earlier books. The identity of a new female character introduced midway is glaringly obvious, and it's frustrating how long it takes the protagonists to uncover it. The villain's motives also become clear too early, diminishing suspense. Additionally, the recurring trope of main characters withholding information from the Quorum and other families continues, despite its consistently poor outcomes. The Blackmores miss out on a satisfying romantic redemption arc, which seems like a missed opportunity. Lastly, by the fifth book, the multitude of returning characters can be overwhelming, making it difficult to recall their significance.",
            "Dasha is one of my favorite protagonists, standing out as the product of two magical families while also feeling like an outsider within the Avramov family. Her battles with grief and passive suicidal ideation resonated deeply with me, particularly the way her ability to cross to the other side was woven into the narrative.",
            "I’ll miss this story and plan to include some of its books in my annual autumn witchy rereads.",
            "This story introduced me to the queer sapphic witch genre, which has quickly become my favorite. As the final installment, I took my time reading it, savoring every moment."

        "conclusion": "This book is a solid 4.5-star read and a fitting conclusion, though it has some predictable elements and unresolved tropes. Dasha’s character and the organic resolution of the overarching plot stand out as highlights. While the predictability and character overload were minor drawbacks, the emotional depth and connection made it a memorable experience.",

However, I can't help but wonder if the supernatural elements threatening Thistle Grove hadn't intervened, whether the two would have reconnected at all, or if it would have taken much longer. The story features a compelling sapphic romance, excellent banter, and a delightful \"third time's a charm\" dynamic.",

In a series with five installments and four witch families, it's surprising that none focused on a Thorn as the main character.

I was glad to see Dasha finally open up about her struggles, even though I can't personally relate to her situation.",
            "I enjoyed the book, though I found it slightly less engaging than previous installments, primarily because I’m not particularly fond of the type of magic the Avramov family specializes in. Dasha’s skill as a devil eater was especially unappealing to me, perhaps more so than any other Avramov magic. A family tree diagram would have been helpful, as I often confused siblings with cousins. This book also highlighted just how intertwined the previous generations of witch families are, which was an eye-opener for me."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Magic System and Themes:**  \n   - I enjoyed the book but liked it slightly less than previous ones because I’ve never been particularly keen on the type of magic the Avramov family excels in.  \n   - Dasha’s expertise as a devil eater was especially unappealing to me, perhaps worse than any other Avramov family magic.  \n\n- **Character Representation and Focus:**  \n   - I’m annoyed that a Thorn witch didn’t get her own book. While this final book has a Thorn witch as the love interest, there are 5 books and 4 witch families, yet none of them feature a Thorn as the main character.  \n\n- **World-Building and Family Dynamics:**  \n   - I would’ve loved to have seen a diagram of the family trees because I kept getting confused about who were siblings versus cousins.  \n   - I didn’t realize how intertwined prior generations of witch families were until this book.  \n\n- **Timeline and Continuity:**  \n   - I found the timeline of events from Book 1 to Book 5 confusing. I thought the full timeline was about 2-3 years, but Dasha’s references to events as “a handful of years ago” made me question this.  \n   - Some references to events from “last summer” or “last year” were accurate, but the inconsistency in timeline references was frustrating.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Development:**  \n   - While this romance wasn’t my favorite in the series, I appreciated the concept of a second (or technically third) chance romance.  \n   - I’m glad Dasha was finally able to be honest about her struggles, even though her situation isn’t something I could personally relate to.  \n\n- **Series Overall:**  \n   - Despite my critiques, I enjoyed this book series and feel bittersweet about this being the end of Thistle Grove.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book had its flaws, particularly in the magic system, character representation, and timeline clarity, I still found it enjoyable.

            "I had hoped to see many beloved characters return to confront the \"massive\" threat to Thistle Grove, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. While the town's fate was resolved, the characters we've followed since the start felt neglected, leaving their arcs incomplete. An epilogue with updates on each character would have provided much-needed closure. The conclusion felt rushed, with a random character swooping in at the last moment to save the day, making the ending feel abrupt and unsatisfying.",
            "In the final book, I found myself indifferent to the main characters. While Ivy is likable, she comes across as one-dimensional and could have benefited from deeper development. Dasha/Daria is a complex character, but her introduction felt too late to foster a connection; as a result, her role in overcoming the threat lacked emotional resonance. Additionally, I was disheartened that Belisima chose to inhabit a stranger rather than Nina. Nina faced considerable challenges throughout the story and truly deserved a better outcome.",

            "Dasha, a rare witch known as a devil eater, possesses the unique ability to banish demons and traverse the veil. Her journey is marked by profound grief and loneliness, making her a complex and relatable character. Brave, fierce, and powerful, Dasha stands out as a compelling protagonist. Her greatest regret is the loss of Ivy Thorn, and a Thistle Grove festival brings them back together, compelling them to confront their unresolved feelings. However, as a romance, the relationship feels underdeveloped; I would have appreciated more moments for their reconnection, especially given Ivy's initial resistance. Nonetheless, the intimacy between Dasha and Ivy is palpable, and their dynamic—steamy and supportive—explores intriguing themes of light and dark. Together, they create a captivating partnership.",

I feel like Harper did a great job ending the series on this note. Even if she decides to add a new story to the series later (which I’d be totally here for), I’m glad it concluded with Dasha and Ivy and the darkness of Dasha’s story.  \n\n- **Character Development (Dasha):**  \n  Dasha herself is incredibly flawed, and it’s beautiful. She’s been through so much and is just trying to fix her life and get back on track. Her struggles feel incredibly human and relatable. I also loved her family’s story—without giving too much away, it’s a reminder that families aren’t always perfect or picture-perfect, and that’s okay. At the end of the day, it’s about the love you create, whether bound by blood or bond.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry (Dasha and Ivy):**  \n  The spice between Dasha and Ivy is good, and there’s real chemistry between them. However, I have to say that the romantic scenes in *Payback’s a Witch* (Book 1) and *Back in a Spell* (Book 3) topped these.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  While the spice is nice, the story itself is what I showed up for. It was satisfying to see glimpses of all the characters we’ve gotten to know throughout the series and to get a bit of closure for some storylines.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read and a strong conclusion to the series. Dasha’s flawed yet relatable character and her journey, along with the exploration of family dynamics, stood out as highlights. While the romantic scenes didn’t quite match the earlier books, the story itself was compelling and provided a satisfying sense of closure.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n9/10 – Highly recommend."

It comes across as a side venture rather than a central element, which leaves much of the story feeling hollow.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main character is decent, but I didn’t connect with them as much as I did with past characters. While previous characters make appearances, they aren’t particularly relevant to this story, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**  \n  The magic in this book is deeper and darker, building on the progression seen in earlier entries. It sets the stage for the finale of Thistle Grove’s magical powers, which I found compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Climax:**  \n  The story reaches the best climax of any of the novels, making it a fitting and satisfying finale for the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book has a strong climax and deeper exploration of magic, the romance and characters didn’t resonate with me as much as in previous installments. This made it my least favorite in the series, despite its strengths in other areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25/5"

There were nods to all the families, but I would have loved to see a POV character from the Thorne line (we’ve had two Harlows, two Avramovs, and one Blackmoore so far).\n   - The final Big Bad was introduced dramatically but resolved too quickly, which was disappointing.\n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**\n   - This book features a sapphic romance between Ivy, a nature witch, and Dasha, a devil eater drawn to the other side, playing on light/dark magic, which was fun.\n   - However, it’s a second-chance romance, which is often a hard sell for me. I didn’t get to see them fall in love; they were already kind of there but on pause, which is my biggest qualm with second-chance romances.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**\n   - I’ve had a lot of fun reading this series, but as a finale, this book fell a bit short. I probably would have rounded it up to a 4 on Goodreads if I weren’t also rating it as the conclusion to the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Rise and Divine* is an enjoyable queer fantasy romcom with a charming setting and intriguing world-building, but it struggles to deliver a satisfying finale to the series.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Series Continuity and World-Building:**  \n  I loved returning to the Avramov family, as they are probably my favorites. Dasha Avramov, with her powerful abilities as a devil eater, was a fascinating character to focus on. The continuation of the story about the magical town of Thistle Grove followed beautifully from *In Charm's Way* and highlighted the aftermath quite well. It was so fun to be back in that magical town, and all the paranormal and mystery elements hit right for me.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  I found the romance underwhelming. It’s a second-chance (actually third-chance) romance with Ivy Thorn, and their getting back together didn’t feel believable to me. So much was invested in the witchcraft that their romance fell more than a little flat.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook was narrated by Bailey Carr. I recognized her voice but couldn’t place it initially, so I looked her up. She also narrated *A Good Girl's Guide to Murder*, and she is so fantastic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the continuation of the Thistle Grove series and the focus on Dasha Avramov’s powerful magic. However, the romance subplot felt underdeveloped and lacked believability. The audiobook narration by Bailey Carr was excellent, adding to the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nRounded up to 4 stars."

            "I was unaware that this was the final book in the series, and I’m heartbroken by the ending. The plot feels disjointed from the earlier novels, particularly *Payback's a Witch*, as it attempts to resolve loose ends introduced in *In Charm's Way*. The author missed an opportunity to better integrate the end-game explored in *Rise and Divine*, as the significant developments came too late in the series.",
            "I wasn't satisfied with how Ivy and Dasha’s second-chance romance was portrayed. Much of their emotional intimacy relied on flashbacks that felt rushed and incomplete. As neither character was a significant presence in previous books, the author had to cover their entire relationship arc—falling in love, breaking up, and reconciling—within an already dense plot. While familiar characters from earlier installments of the series return in *Rise and Divine*, their appearances felt minimal, leaving me wanting more than just fleeting references to beloved figures.",
            "In Thistle Grove, a small, interconnected community, I felt the final installment fell short in capturing the essence of connection. The story didn’t fully leverage the established relationships and dynamics from previous novels, leaving me wanting more."

After five books, too many book crushes and demons later, I had to sit with this on my chest and hug my paperback for a moment as I said farewell to the four founding families.\n\n- **Character Favorites:**  \n  I loved each book, but Dasha’s story and Nina’s were definitely my favorites.\n\n- **World-Building and Genre:**  \n  The series is really great for some world-building and witchy chick lit. If you’re looking for some Halloween reads, go visit Thistle Grove in these pages.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis final installment of the Thistle Grove series was a heartfelt and satisfying conclusion, leaving me emotional as I bid farewell to the beloved characters and world. The series as a whole, with its strong world-building and engaging witchy themes, is a perfect choice for Halloween reading.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I felt like the story needed more time to develop and explore the events in greater depth.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I absolutely love the world of Thistle Grove and its magical atmosphere. It’s a setting that continues to captivate me, and it’s one of the strongest aspects of the series.\n\n- **Plot Depth:**  \n  The books, including this one, desperately needed to be longer to allow for more in-depth exploration of the plot. I felt like there was so much potential that wasn’t fully realized due to the rushed pacing.\n\n- **Expectations (Humorous Aside):**  \n  The absence of evil god-based threesomes was a missed opportunity and felt like a crime. (This seems to be a humorous or personal expectation rather than a serious critique.)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I adore the magical world of Thistle Grove and its enchanting vibe, the pacing of this book was too fast, leaving the plot feeling underdeveloped. The story would have benefited from being longer to fully explore its potential. Despite this, the setting remains a highlight, though some personal expectations (like the lack of evil god-based threesomes) were left unfulfilled.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

However, I liked this one a bit less compared to some of the others in the series.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  One of the reasons I didn’t enjoy this book as much was the reduced focus on world-building, which I felt was stronger in previous books.\n\n- **Character Development and Tropes:**  \n  I appreciated that the story avoided the overused trope of the \"big toxic sexy evil guy\" as a romantic or central figure, which felt refreshing and added to my enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book was enjoyable and maintained the fun tone of the series, it fell slightly short for me due to less emphasis on world-building. However, the avoidance of a clichéd character trope was a positive aspect that I appreciated.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the characters and plot didn’t fully captivate me as I had hoped, making it a decent but ultimately underwhelming read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."
