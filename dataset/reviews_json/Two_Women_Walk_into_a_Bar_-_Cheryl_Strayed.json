            "The story unfolds over two decades, starting with the protagonist, a twenty-seven-year-old waitress and aspiring novelist, who meets Joan, her boyfriend Brian's mother. Fast forward twenty years, and Joan, now eighty-five and battling end-stage COPD, is reluctant to enter high-level care. The narrative deftly alternates between past and present, delving into the evolving relationship between the protagonist and Joan. Ultimately, the protagonist and Brian convince Joan to accept help, navigating the emotional complexities of her final days together.",
            "The author reflects on her initial awkwardness with Joan, illustrating how their relationship evolved into a “particular, conditional sort of love” shaped more by circumstance than by deep connection. Over time, she resolves to love Joan “differently, better than I had—like a daughter would.” Joan's critical nature, particularly regarding the protagonist’s appearance and her partner’s career, underscores societal values surrounding thinness and female worth. However, the author’s response to Joan’s criticisms shifts from hurt to a blend of humor, stoicism, and sympathy. The introduction of a death doula enriches the narrative, offering insights into the practical and emotional dimensions of end-of-life care and deepening the exploration of mortality. Additionally, Brian’s role as a bridge between the two central characters is subtly woven into the story, emphasizing the interconnectedness of their lives.",

            "This story offers a poignant glimpse into the narrator's fraught relationship with her mother-in-law, Joan, which comes to the forefront following Joan's terminal illness diagnosis. Over two decades, their bond has been characterized by conditional love, politeness, and shared circumstances rather than genuine connection. The narrative's strength lies in its exploration of end-of-life experiences and the complex emotions they evoke, making it relatable even to those unfamiliar with the author's previous works.",
            "The relationship between the protagonist and Joan is pivotal, with Brian—Joan's son and the protagonist's husband—serving as the fulcrum of their strained bond. Joan's assertion that no love surpasses that of a mother and son contrasts sharply with the protagonist's struggle to call her \"Mom\" after losing her own mother, underscoring their emotional distance. Despite past grievances and misunderstandings, the two women reach a poignant understanding in Joan's final days, recognizing their shared history and familial connections.",

I admire her exquisite empathy, her way with words, her ability to communicate emotion, and her wisdom.  \n   - Cheryl Strayed has a unique gift for conveying humanness, which I deeply appreciate.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - This short story had some of the qualities I love, but it lacked the abundance of humanness that Cheryl Strayed usually gifts us.  \n   - I had to look up whether it was the same author who wrote *Wild*, the book that changed my perspective on life and that I recommend to everyone.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - I enjoyed and could relate to her relationship with her mother-in-law, but I felt Cheryl may have held back a little in exploring it.  \n   - I wanted a novel with this relationship highlighted more prominently.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - I’m not saying skip this book; please devour all that this talented author writes.  \n   - I’m used to getting more from her work, and perhaps my expectations were higher than what this story delivered.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Context:**  \n   - Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.  \n   - I initially hesitated to rate it using stars because I was reviewing it expecting the depth of a novel, which isn’t entirely fair to this story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this short story showcases Cheryl Strayed’s signature empathy and emotional insight, it didn’t fully meet my expectations compared to her previous works like *Wild*. I enjoyed the relatable relationship with the mother-in-law but felt the story could have delved deeper. Despite this, I still recommend reading it, as Cheryl Strayed’s writing is always worth experiencing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded up to 4."

My bad.  \n   - If I'd read more than thirty-one pages of this syrupy psycho-babble, I might have opened a vein.  \n\n- **Author Recognition and Previous Work:**  \n   - I’m embarrassed to be the only literate American who failed to recognize the author's name and associate it with the best-seller *Wild*.  \n   - I haven’t read *Wild* and won’t. I’ve already read one book about a heartbroken young woman hiking the Pacific Crest Trail solo.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n   - The essay is about the author’s relationship with her difficult mother-in-law, Jackie, who is now dying and being rehabilitated in the narrative.  \n   - Jackie’s childhood is examined to excuse her sins, and the story insists on portraying her as a wonderful person who loved everyone but didn’t show it.  \n   - The author’s insistence on reconciliation feels forced and unrealistic, especially given Jackie’s lifelong neglect and emotional abuse.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal and Authenticity:**  \n   - The mark of a good writer is letting characters reveal themselves. The author fails by insisting readers believe Jackie is loving when her actions show the opposite.  \n   - Rewriting history to suit the narrative doesn’t make it true. This approach may alienate readers who’ve experienced abuse and can’t forgive or reconcile.  \n\n- **Author’s Personal Bias and Contradictions:**  \n   - The author is estranged from her abusive father but doesn’t apply the same logic of reconciliation to him. This inconsistency undermines her argument.  \n   - Her views resonate with many readers, and she’s built a profitable career, which I admire. However, I disagree with her conclusions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Appeal:**  \n   - I enjoyed the author’s excellent writing and the interesting stories about her husband’s family.  \n   - Her advice seems aimed at young people who share her worldview, but I’m not her demographic.  \n\n- **Moral and Philosophical Perspective:**  \n   - Actions speak louder than words. Childhood scars don’t excuse being a selfish adult.  \n   - Reality can be cold and harsh, but facing it squarely has advantages.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the author’s writing style and storytelling ability, I found the essay’s themes and conclusions unconvincing and at odds with my own experiences and beliefs. The forced reconciliation and rewriting of Jackie’s character felt inauthentic, and the essay’s brevity and format were disappointing.
