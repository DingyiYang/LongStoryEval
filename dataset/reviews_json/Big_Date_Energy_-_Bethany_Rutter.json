            "This narrative is enjoyable and easy to immerse oneself in, embodying the low-stress, high-fun essence typical of romcoms. However, the plot leans towards predictability, and the ending feels overly tidy. The story could have delved into more unconventional relationship dynamics, such as polyamory, even if not through the main character, Fran. \n\nThe novel follows Fran, a bisexual woman who decides to explore dating after ending her third long-term monogamous relationship. Her mother signs her up for a TV dating show, *The Meet-Cute*, where Fran unexpectedly reunites with her ex-girlfriend, Ivy, who broke her heart. This premise is particularly engaging for fans of dating shows, as it reflects real-life scenarios where participants may have prior connections.",
            "Fran is a confident and self-aware protagonist who embraces her bisexuality and enjoys casual dating. Her positive outlook, even in the face of bad dates, is refreshing. The story deepens her character as she recognizes that her fun-focused approach sometimes causes her to overlook her friends and family, adding complexity to her journey.",
            "This book celebrates bisexuality, fat positivity, and the diverse spectrum of dating experiences, highlighting that everyone has different desires. It steers clear of clichés, such as portraying bad dates solely as comedic or bizarre, and instead showcases Fran’s confident approach to dating."

        "conclusion": "*Big Date Energy* is a fun, lighthearted romcom that celebrates bisexuality, fat positivity, and the diversity of dating experiences. While the plot is predictable and the ending feels tidy, Fran’s journey is engaging and relatable, with moments of self-reflection adding depth to her character.

Her positive outlook, even on bad dates, is refreshing.  \n   - The story adds depth to Fran’s character when she realizes her fun-focused attitude sometimes leads her to neglect checking in with friends and family, adding complexity to her journey.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n   - The book celebrates bisexuality, fat positivity, and the diversity of dating experiences, emphasizing that not everyone is looking for the same thing.  \n   - It avoids clichés like depicting bad dates as purely comedic or weird, instead focusing on Fran’s self-assured approach to dating.  \n\n- **Pacing and Predictability:**  \n   - The narrative is enjoyable and easy to get absorbed into, with a low-stress, high-fun formula typical of romcoms.  \n   - However, the plot is somewhat predictable, and the ending feels a bit too neat. The story could have explored less conventional relationship dynamics, such as polyamory, even if not through Fran.  \n\n- **Potential for Expansion:**  \n   - The book leaves room for a sequel, possibly focusing on Fran’s friends or delving deeper into her career as a makeup artist.

            "The romance, though not the central focus, was sweet and charming. Ivy, Fran’s first love, is enchanting, and their second-chance romance is compelling. I appreciated the contrast in their responses to their breakup: Fran embraced relationships and casual dating, while Ivy remained emotionally connected to Fran. The narrative never portrayed Fran’s “slag era” as a mistake, affirming that both relationships and casual dating are equally valid.",
            "Fran is a delightful character—confident, refreshing, and irrepressible. Her light, conversational tone makes it feel like you're chatting with a friend. Unapologetically herself, she candidly discusses her sex life, body image, and career in beauty and makeup, all while resisting societal pressures that seek to define her. Fran's growth, particularly in her friendships and self-discovery, adds depth to her character. The supporting cast, including her friends and family, is well-developed and enriches the narrative. The book addresses serious issues like fatphobia in the beauty and fashion industries with grace, skillfully balancing these themes with its overall lightheartedness. The humor—both dry and situational—kept me giggling throughout, with the jokes landing perfectly, especially in the audiobook format.",
            "I approached this story expecting a romance, but it leans more towards a romcom or comedic general fiction. Fran's personal journey takes precedence over any romantic relationship, which, while interesting, became somewhat tedious after the 60% mark. I found myself missing the romantic tension and connection that I had hoped for."

The unapologetic representation of plus-size individuals is beautifully portrayed. I also enjoyed the queer and bi representation, which adds depth to the story. The diverse cast of lovable characters is a highlight, with Fran’s mom being a particular favorite of mine—she’s just so endearing. On the other hand, I found Fran’s brother quite frustrating and wanted to punch him! I do wish there had been more focus on the dating show and the relationship between Fran and Ivy, as I felt less invested in their romance due to the limited interactions we saw.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Romance Development:**  \n  I disagree with the criticism that the main romance felt rushed. To me, it felt real—messy, panicked, and sudden. This approach avoided the predictable \"third-act breakup\" trope, which I found refreshing and relatable.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  While this is a romance book, it also beautifully explores the power of friendship. The friendships in the story felt authentic—they molded the characters, called them out, and supported them in meaningful ways (even with humorous moments like dressing up as a police officer!).  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel struck a hopeful and escapist tone, which I appreciated. It didn’t rely on a catalog of \"bad dates\" or a cynical \"people are trash\" message. Instead, it felt uplifting and reminded me that art doesn’t always have to imitate life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a breath of fresh air in the romance genre. It balanced a realistic, messy romance with heartfelt themes of friendship and hope, creating an escapist yet meaningful reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Fran as she embraces her \"Big Slag Era\" after a breakup, delving into themes of dating and self-discovery. While the TV dating show subplot had the potential for greater impact, it ultimately felt underutilized. Additionally, Fran's frequent transitions between temporary living spaces and her numerous dates contributed to a sense of repetition in the narrative.",
            "In this novel, Fran, a bisexual plus-sized woman, offers a refreshing perspective. It's uplifting to see her receive positive romantic attention, contributing to the body positivity representation in the story.",
            "This novel presents a humorous and enjoyable exploration of dating and self-acceptance, highlighting themes of queer representation and body positivity as its standout features."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a lighthearted and humorous novel that focuses more on dating than traditional romance. While it has strong queer and body positivity representation, the repetitive elements and underdeveloped TV show plotline left me feeling like something was missing. Despite this, it’s an enjoyable read for those looking for a fun, modern take on dating and self-discovery.",
