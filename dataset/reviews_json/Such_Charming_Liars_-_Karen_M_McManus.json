Unbeknownst to Jamie, Kat tags along, and their task is to replace an expensive necklace with a forgery during a birthday celebration. At the venue, they encounter Luke, Jamie's ex-husband from a brief Vegas marriage, along with his son, Liam. Kat and Liam share a poignant childhood memory of getting lost in Vegas for six hours. Meanwhile, Luke is also a grifter, with Liam attempting to thwart his father's schemes.",

However, the author surprised me by revealing Liam is gay, which I appreciated as it allowed for a genuine opposite-sex friendship that doesn't turn romantic. I found Jamie's character utterly unlikable, and I felt the author's background as an abuse survivor didn't excuse the poor way Kat was raised.

When a burglary escalates into murder, Kat and Liam must join forces to identify the culprit(s) and ensure their safety‚Äîall while navigating their trust in one another.

McManus's newest releases every Thanksgiving at my grandparents' house.\n   - I usually find her books to include a twisty mystery with a central romance that doesn't interest me as much as the side one.\n   - Her writing and characters are always fun, so I was ready for another enjoyable read.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - The book, *Such Charming Liars*, features two main characters, Kat and Liam, whose parents have driven them into a life of deception and betrayal.\n   - Linked by a temporary Vegas marriage between her mom and his dad, they reunite during a mysterious weekend on a fancy estate.\n   - Burglary leads to murder, and Kat and Liam must work together to uncover the culprit(s) and keep themselves safe‚Äîas long as they can trust each other.\n   - The mystery was layered and required some suspension of disbelief at times, but it was incredibly fun to delve into.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**\n   - I was delighted that the male and female main characters didn't have a romance. Instead, they share an enduring sibling-like bond from their history together, which leads to a fantastic relationship.\n   - I adore stories not focused on romance, and watching a platonic bond develop is usually much more enjoyable.\n   - There‚Äôs also a sweet little side gay romance to satisfy that unchecked McManus box.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**\n   - Looking back at my old reviews of her books, the only one I almost gave 4.75/5 stars to was *Two Can Keep a Secret*.\n   - I remember being bored by the romance in that book, but the mystery and cast of characters were great.\n   - This time, I liked *Such Charming Liars* far more than I expected.\n\n- **Hopes for Future Works:**\n   - Since *One of Us Is Lying* got a series, I‚Äôm crossing my fingers for this one to receive similar treatment.\n   - At the very least, I hope for a similar main character dynamic in the next release.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Such Charming Liars* exceeded my expectations with its layered mystery, engaging character dynamics, and lack of a central romance.

            "The book takes a while to get going, with the delay in action feeling less frustrating than in previous reads. The characters and their unique backstories are engaging enough to hold my interest even before the first murder. Once the pivotal event occurs, the pace quickens significantly, transforming the narrative into a gripping page-turner. Each page is filled with developments that keep the story unpredictable, leaving me too engrossed to guess the ending.",
            "This story features well-developed characters with distinct and endearing personalities. Their dilemmas and inner thoughts are skillfully portrayed, making the slower beginning enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Liam and Kat; their sibling-like bond and protective feelings for each other were heartwarming. I appreciated that their connection wasn‚Äôt romantic, offering a refreshing change in YA literature. The found family dynamic proved to be more delightful than the romance, which was a lovely touch. I also liked that one character remained single, effectively conveying that being single is perfectly acceptable‚Äîa message that more YA authors should emphasize. While there is romance present, it isn‚Äôt the central focus, which I found refreshing. It‚Äôs rare to encounter a YA book where not every character is paired off, and I appreciated seeing a character comfortably embrace their single status.",
            "I've read nearly all of the author's works, though I've only truly enjoyed about 30% of them. When I saw that she had a new book out, I eagerly rented it. Thanks to *Such Charming Liars*, my enjoyment percentage has now risen to 40%! The action was well-paced, and the villains felt integrated into the story rather than appearing abruptly. Unlike some authors who overreach for originality at the cost of narrative coherence, this book delivered a satisfying conclusion."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author's Track Record and Expectations:**\n   - I have read almost all of Karen M. McManus's books religiously, though I‚Äôve honestly liked less than half of them‚Äîmaybe 30%. When I saw she had a new book out, I immediately rented it as soon as it was available. Thanks to *Such Charming Liars*, the percentage of her books I‚Äôve enjoyed has now risen to 40%!\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**\n   - As usual, the book takes a long time to get started. It feels like forever before someone dies, but this time, it bothered me less. The characters and their backstories were original and captivating enough to keep me engaged even without the blood and suspense.\n   - Once the murder happens, the pace picks up dramatically, and the book becomes highly addictive. Something happens on every page, making it hard to predict the ending because I was too engrossed in the story to try guessing.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**\n   - The characters are well-developed, each with distinct personalities, and they are very endearing. Their dilemmas and inner thoughts are well-portrayed, making the slower beginning enjoyable.\n   - The relationship between Liam and Kat was particularly enjoyable to read. Their sibling-like bond and the protective feelings they developed for each other were heartwarming. I appreciated that their relationship wasn‚Äôt romantic, which is a refreshing change in YA literature.\n   - The found family dynamic was cuter than the romance, which was a nice touch. I also liked that one of the main characters remained single, showing that being single isn‚Äôt a problem‚Äîa message I wish more YA authors would embrace.\n\n- **Romance and Themes:**\n   - There was a romance, but it wasn‚Äôt the central focus, which I appreciated. It‚Äôs rare to see a YA book where not every character is paired off, and it was refreshing to see a character unaffected by being single.\n\n- **Action and Suspense:**\n   - The action was well-balanced, and the villains at the end didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. Sometimes, in these types of books, authors try too hard to be original and end up making the ending feel random and unearned, but that wasn‚Äôt the case here.\n\n- **Critiques (Minor Spoilers):**\n   - At times, the teenagers had questionable priorities. For example, they were in mortal danger, people were dying, and yet they were more upset about minor lies or irrelevant details, like their mom not legally finalizing a divorce. It felt unrealistic and frustrating.\n   - Similarly, they had major revelations, but what shocked them the most was something trivial, like Luke proposing to Annalise. It felt like they weren‚Äôt focusing on the real issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I really enjoyed *Such Charming Liars*. The characters were engaging, the relationships were well-developed, and the pacing kept me hooked. While there were some moments where the characters‚Äô priorities felt off, the book was still a thrilling and enjoyable read. I‚Äôm already looking forward to Karen M. McManus‚Äôs next book and hope it continues to meet my expectations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned, but the reviewer expresses a significant improvement in their enjoyment of the author‚Äôs work, rising from 30% to 40%."

Augustus, in particular, stole the show for me‚Äîdefinitely one of my faves.\n\n- **Storyline and Execution:**\n   - All in all, I dug the majority of the characters, and the storyline was super unique.

However, the pacing felt uneven, only gaining momentum around 70% into the story. This may be influenced by my own reading circumstances, as it took me longer than usual to finish. The heist and con artist elements offered a refreshing twist, enhancing the character dynamics. Additionally, the introduction of morally gray characters added depth to the mystery/thriller genre.",

The dynamic within the trio, including Augustus, was enjoyable, especially the interactions between Augustus and Kat. While the romance between Liam and Augustus was delightful, it was not the primary focus, which I appreciated. The representation of a non-heterosexual main couple was a positive aspect, and it was refreshing that Kat remained independent, not paired off with anyone.",

The lack of a compelling plot, especially the absence of the anticipated heist and thrill, made it a frustrating read.

While the story was enjoyable, I had to suspend my disbelief regarding their age and capabilities.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the age issue, the book was super fun and engaging. It‚Äôs my favorite of all the author‚Äôs works, as it kept me entertained throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I found the premise of 16-year-olds solving murders a bit unrealistic, the book was incredibly enjoyable and stands out as my favorite from the author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The planned heist, a smuggler family, and the looming threat of a loose murderer heighten the suspense.

The smooth writing and well-timed cliffhangers make it difficult to put the book down.",

This allows the narrative to focus on the murder investigation and the heist. Many characters harbor shady pasts, and eavesdropping on their dubious conversations heightens the intrigue.",

            "This book offers a captivating story and an intriguing heist plot that I thoroughly enjoyed. It effectively keeps readers guessing about the identity of the killer. While the pacing occasionally felt slow, making it challenging to maintain engagement, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The unpredictable ending is a standout, sure to surprise most readers.",
            "**Kat:** A lovable, resourceful character who is quick-witted and deeply cares for her mother while respecting her boss, Gem. Her straightforward nature is complemented by a surprising backstory. \n\n**Liam:** A sweet, naive character who has endured significant loss, including the death of his mother and a troubled relationship with his father, Luke. Although intelligent, he lacks the killer instincts necessary for tough situations. \n\n**Augustus:** My favorite character, he is sarcastic, clever, and possesses a wonderful sense of humor. His nickname \"Chaos\" perfectly suits him, and his thoughtful gestures, like hanging Liam's painting, are endearing.\n\n**Gem:** Efficient and nurturing, she provides a home for Kat and Jamie, though the story doesn‚Äôt fully showcase her strengths.\n\n**Jamie:** A caring figure who is determined to improve their lives. Her obsession with granola hints at her good intentions.\n\n**Sutherland Family:** This dysfunctional family grapples with numerous issues, with characters like Annalise, Griffin, and Larissa making notable impressions. The dynamics feel strained overall. \n\nThe highlight of the story is the relationship between Liam and Augustus; their chemistry is adorable, and I found myself invested in their romance. I appreciated that Liam and Kat did not end up together, as their sibling-like bond would have rendered a romantic relationship off-key.",

            "This engaging teenage heist story follows Kat, whose jewel-thief mother is determined to go straight but takes on one last job. When Kat‚Äôs mother falls ill, Kat is forced to step into her shoes. Meanwhile, Kat‚Äôs ‚ÄúVegas stepbrother,‚Äù Liam, navigates a con involving Annaliese, the owner of the necklace Kat‚Äôs mother intends to steal. The plot thickens when the necklace goes missing, and a Sutherland family member is found dead, leaving Kat as the only witness. The story is a quick and enjoyable read, infused with humor‚Äîa highlight being a scene where Kat struggles to serve lunch with an expensive ring stuck on her finger. Yet, it also delves into tension and mystery as the theft and murder unfold.",
            "In this dual-narrator story, Kat and Liam each bring their unique perspectives to the plot. Kat is laser-focused on executing the heist, whereas Liam tends to be more introspective, often daydreaming about Augustus, Annaliese‚Äôs nephew. Liam embodies the typical teenage experience, while Kat‚Äôs unconventional upbringing has forced her to mature rapidly."

After struggling with *One of Us is Back* (I couldn‚Äôt keep the details or characters straight), I‚Äôve realized her standalones, like *The Cousins* and this one, are more enjoyable for me.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**\n   - This is a fun teenage heist story. Kat‚Äôs mother, a jewel thief, is ready to go straight but takes on one last job. Kat, her daughter, gets involved when her mother falls ill, forcing her to step into her mother‚Äôs role. The story also follows Liam, Kat‚Äôs ‚ÄúVegas stepbrother,‚Äù whose father is involved in a con targeting Annaliese, the owner of the necklace Kat‚Äôs mother plans to steal. The plot thickens when the necklace goes missing, and a Sutherland family member ends up dead, with Kat as the only witness.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - Kat and Liam are the dual narrators, and their perspectives drive the story. Kat is singularly focused on the heist, while Liam is more introspective, often mooning over Augustus, Annaliese‚Äôs nephew. Liam feels more like a typical teenager, while Kat has had to grow up quickly due to her unconventional upbringing.\n\n- **Pacing and Tone:**\n   - The story is a fun, quick read with a comedic tone, especially in scenes like Kat serving lunch with an expensive ring stuck on her finger. However, there‚Äôs also tension and mystery, particularly when the necklace disappears and a murder occurs.\n\n- **Adult vs. YA Themes:**\n   - The story feels more geared toward adults than teens, reflecting a broader trend in YA literature. While the characters are teenagers, the plot‚Äôs complexity and the Sutherland family drama sometimes made me wish the story focused on the adults instead. That said, it makes sense for Kat and Liam to be the narrators given how the story unfolds.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - I found the characters entertaining and the story engaging. It‚Äôs a light, enjoyable read, and I can see it being popular when it‚Äôs released.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis standalone novel by McManus is a fun, fast-paced teenage heist with a mix of comedy, mystery, and drama. While I found myself more drawn to her standalone works than her series, this book was an entertaining read with well-developed characters and an intriguing plot. It‚Äôs a great choice for fans of YA heist stories, though it may also appeal to adult readers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Their paths cross at a billionaire's birthday party, setting the stage for a heist and a murder.

The plot takes a dramatic turn when Ross's son, Parker, is killed in front of Kat, sparking chaos and danger. \n\nAs Kat, Liam, and Augustus (Ross's grandson) navigate these perilous twists, they form a heartwarming bond amid the turmoil.

While Kat has a realness to her, she doesn‚Äôt feel as relatable as characters like Bronwyn and Nate.\n\n- **Key Elements of McManus's Writing:**\n   - The book retains the key elements I associate with McManus's writing: untrustworthy characters, a gripping plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and well-foreshadowed twists that are unpredictable yet satisfying in hindsight.\n\n- **Character Development and Dual POVs:**\n   - I appreciated getting both Kat and Liam's perspectives, which allowed me to understand their personalities, motivations, and how their pasts shaped them. Their relationships with their parents and each other were particularly intriguing, showing how similar events led to different reactions and consequences.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**\n   - The ending felt rushed, with twice as much happening in the same number of pages compared to the rest of the book. Slowing it down slightly would have made the conclusion feel more balanced and satisfying.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Expectations:**\n   - Overall, this was an enjoyable read, though it doesn‚Äôt hold up as well compared to some of McManus's other books, which I find more fantastically done.

            "The plot is impressive and intricately woven, with many elements coming together effectively. However, a significant plot hole emerges concerning Annalise's actions and motivations, particularly in relation to her relationship with Luke and her knowledge of the heist. The chronology is inconsistent; Annalise was aware of Luke's scams before he was involved in the heist yet chose to continue dating him without a clear rationale. Since the heist did not hinge on Luke, her decision to remain with him feels unnecessary and lacks explanation.",
            "Annalise's choice to test Parker by disclosing the plan through multiple sources is logical; however, her ongoing relationship with Luke remains unexplained. Additionally, Parker's possession of the fake necklace could have been better clarified, perhaps by suggesting he intended to steal Kat's ring and inadvertently found the necklace instead.",

            "The story features numerous twists and reveals, some of which seem excessive and unnecessary. The twist regarding Annalise‚Äôs true nature‚Äîattempting to blackmail a child‚Äîwas particularly disappointing, as it undermined her previously positive portrayal. Narrated from the perspectives of Kat and her stepbrother Liam, the plot unfolds around their families, with Kat and her mother, Jamie, as jewel thieves, while Liam‚Äôs father, Luke, scams women on dating sites. The central narrative revolves around a heist where Kat and Liam unwittingly target the family of Luke‚Äôs latest conquest, ultimately bringing them back together after years apart. Despite its flaws, the premise is engaging and the well-crafted narrative kept me thoroughly captivated.",

Jamie, Kat's mother, comes across as irresponsible and unlikable; her redemption arc at the end falls short of compensating for her neglectful parenting. Annalise, who initially appears as a caring adult supporting Liam and acknowledging Luke's flaws, later reveals a darker side, which is disappointing.",

While the pacing could be improved, the story‚Äôs complexity and unexpected turns make it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of heist-themed narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This fast-paced novel is packed with high-stakes scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. The thrilling life-and-death situations heightened the excitement of the story. I appreciated that the plot did not revolve around a romantic relationship between Kat and Liam; this choice allowed the friendship and family dynamics to take center stage. The book seamlessly combines elements of a heist, murder mystery, and the drama of the wealthy, creating a multi-layered and engaging narrative. While some plot twists were predictable, the reveals‚Äîparticularly concerning the main villain's identity and motives‚Äîwere nonetheless satisfying.",
            "The characters, especially Kat and Liam, are well-developed, and their friendship serves as a standout element of the story. Liam's brotherly love for Kat is beautifully depicted, adding emotional depth. However, the characters tend to behave more like adults than teenagers, necessitating a degree of suspension of disbelief.",
            "This book rejuvenated my faith in the author as a YA mystery writer, especially after being let down by her recent works, *You‚Äôll Be the Death of Me* and *Nothing More to Tell*. The engaging writing style captivated me from start to finish.",
            "While the premise of a 16-year-old taking charge and certain plot conveniences stretched my suspension of disbelief, the depiction of professional grifters and their operations was captivating and skillfully crafted."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a thrilling blend of heist, mystery, and drama, with well-developed characters and a fast-paced plot. While some elements felt unrealistic and required suspension of disbelief, the high-stakes scenes and emotional depth of the relationships made it an enjoyable read. The absence of a forced romance and the fascinating portrayal of professional grifters were highlights. Overall, it‚Äôs a strong return to form for the author in the YA mystery genre.",

It felt very different from her other books, and I respect that.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n   - Up until the end‚Äîlike 4/5ths through the book‚ÄîI was really getting into this story. I actually thought of writing a GLOWING review before I'd even finished the novel.  \n   - However, the book was chockfull of plot, and in the end, there were just too many plots and awkward exposition. When one of the villains starts monologuing at length, you know you're in trouble.  \n\n- **Representation and Character Development:**  \n   - I appreciated that a couple of characters were gay and that wasn't treated as anything out of the ordinary.  \n   - \"One of Us Is Lying\" had a closeted gay character, and I get it, but it would have been nice if that hadn't been one character's \"major\" secret.  \n   - I liked all the teenagers. Karen is really good at fleshing out likable characters that are realistic and imperfect. It's the main reason I enjoy her books so much.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - I would highly recommend this book, even if it would have benefitted quite a bit if there just wasn't SO MUCH plot.  \n   - Other than the \"One of Us Is Lying\" series‚Äîwhich I just reread a couple of months ago‚Äîthis is probably my favorite book she's written.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel stands out as one of Karen McManus' best works, its overabundance of plotlines and awkward exposition detracted from an otherwise engaging story.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  Karen M. McManus has found a niche in YA Mystery/Thrillers. This is clearly a YA book, which is totally fine. It's not hard-hitting, and the storyline is pretty easy to spot, but I think teens will definitely enjoy the slightly darker mystery that doesn't push boundaries too harshly.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story revolves around Kat, whose mom is a thief trying to get out of the business but not before one final heist. Along the way, they encounter Kat's former step-brother and stepfather (thanks to a quickie Vegas marriage that lasted only a few short days). While navigating this weird family reunion, Kat also has to sneak around undetected by the host family‚Äîeasier said than done given the ensuing chaos. Themes of death, theft, deceit, and family dynamics are central to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are very enjoyable and well-built, with backstories and depth that add to their relatability and complexity.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The story provides a clean wrap-up that won't be haunting for younger readers, which is a nice touch for a YA novel.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I'll tell my students about the presence of language, alcohol, drugs, poison, violence/gore/death, physical abuse (past tense), trauma/mental health, and LGBTQ+ themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an engaging YA mystery/thriller with well-developed characters and a slightly darker tone that teens will enjoy. While the plot is straightforward, it‚Äôs a fun and accessible read with a satisfying resolution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (I really liked it).  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to NetGalley & Random House Children's, Delacorte Press for the free ARC.

The story follows Jamie, a jewel-thief mother, and her teenage daughter, Kat, as they attend a wealthy family's birthday party to pull off one last heist for their mentor, who also serves as a surrogate grandmother. When Jamie falls ill, Kat steps in to take control of the heist. At the same party are Luke, a charming con artist and father, and his son, Liam. While Luke appears to be deceiving the rich daughter, his true motives remain uncertain. The murder mystery unfolds with occasional confusion, yet it remains highly entertaining.

The unexpected twist at the end added a delightful layer of unpredictability to the narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Writing Style:**  \n  The book is a classic Karen M. McManus novel, filled with twists and turns. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, the story took another unexpected turn, which kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  I assume this is a YA (Young Adult) novel, as Karen M. McManus is primarily known for writing in this genre. However, I noticed that this book seemed to have more explicit language compared to her other works, which stood out to me.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The male narrator for the audiobook came across as robotic, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy his performance as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a highly enjoyable read with a gripping, twisty plot that kept me guessing. While the audiobook narration was a letdown, the story itself was classic Karen M. McManus and delivered the suspense and surprises I expected.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nIf I could, I would rate this 4.5 out of 5."

While the premise was intriguing, it didn‚Äôt stand out as my favorite book by McManus.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  I enjoyed following Kat as she attempted to carry out Jamie‚Äôs job. Her journey of figuring out who was behind the mishaps she kept encountering added depth to her character and kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author‚Äôs Other Works:**  \n  This book didn‚Äôt resonate with me as much as some of McManus‚Äôs other works. I still have a few of her books on my shelf that I need to read, so I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring more of her writing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an interesting premise and engaging character dynamics, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations compared to McManus‚Äôs other works. However, I still found enjoyment in Kat‚Äôs journey and the mystery surrounding the heist.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
