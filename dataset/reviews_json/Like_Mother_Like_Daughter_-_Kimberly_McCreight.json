            "The story masterfully builds tension, captivating readers with its mystery from the outset. It alternates between two timelines: Cleo's quest to find her missing mother and the events that led to Katrina's disappearance. This dual structure enhances the narrative's engagement and suspense. The author skillfully incorporates multiple twists, including a pivotal pharmacy case, a ghost from Kat's past, and her husband's dire financial troubles. Readers are invited to develop theories and piece together the puzzle, making the mystery both interactive and rewarding.",

Then Cleo discovers her mom’s bloody shoe under the sofa. Something terrible has happened. But what? The polar opposite of Cleo, whose “out of control” emotions and “unsafe” behavior have created a seemingly unbridgeable rift between mother and daughter, Kat is the essence of Park Slope perfection: a happily married, successful corporate lawyer. Or so Cleo thinks. Kat has been lying. She’s not just a lawyer; she’s her firm’s fixer. She’s damn good at it, too. Growing up in a dangerous group home taught her how to think fast, stay calm under pressure, and recognize a real threat when she sees one. And in the days leading up to her disappearance, Kat has become aware of multiple threats: demands for money from her unfaithful soon-to-be ex-husband; evidence that Cleo has slipped back into a relationship that’s far riskier than she understands; and menacing anonymous messages from her past—all of which she’s kept hidden from Cleo.  \n\n**Trigger Warnings:**  \nMissing person, threatening messages, gaslighting, infidelity, mention of blackmail and rape.  \n\n*Thank you to Kimberly McCreight and Knopf Publishing for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.*  \n**PUB DATE:** July 30, 2024"

I had no idea this was a family affair until the very end, and it seriously makes the audio so special. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Olivia and Cassandra were fantastic narrators for the mother and daughter characters of Cleo and Kat.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Engagement:**  \n  I will admit I had part of the mystery figured out, but there were plenty of other twists that McCreight managed to sucker-punch me with. *Like Mother, Like Daughter* is a quick and bingeable read that is best consumed with a bowl of popcorn for all that drama.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to the publishers for my advanced listening and reader copies of this book.

The story is further enhanced by Kat’s journal entries from 1993, when she was younger than Cleo and living in a dubious group home, alongside transcripts from Cleo’s therapy sessions. This layered approach not only keeps the narrative engaging but also adds significant depth to the storytelling.",

Kat’s perspective is set prior to her disappearance, while Cleo’s begins after she discovers a bloody shoe and burning food in the oven at her mother’s house. The story is further enriched by Kat’s journal entries from 1993, when she was younger than Cleo and living in a sketchy group home, as well as transcripts of Cleo’s therapy sessions. This layered approach keeps the narrative engaging and adds depth to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Both Kat and Cleo are intelligent, stubborn, and risk-taking characters who are far from perfect but feel very realistic. Kat has transformed into a successful lawyer and a “fixer” for her powerful firm, while Cleo is a college-aged daughter grappling with her mother’s disappearance and the secrets she uncovers. Their flaws and complexities make them relatable and compelling.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n  The novel explores a fraught mother-daughter relationship, made even more tenuous by Kat’s disappearance and Cleo’s attempts to find her. The story delves into themes of trust, identity, and the impact of the past on the present. The tension between their current lives and Kat’s hidden past adds emotional weight to the narrative.  \n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  The thriller elements are well-executed, with someone trying to blackmail Kat and threaten Cleo. The mystery of whether this is related to Kat’s current work assignment or her hidden past keeps the reader guessing. As the storylines converge, the suspense builds, making it a page-turner.  \n\n- **Literary Pet Peeves:**  \n  Both Kat and Cleo have eyes that shift from blue to green to gray depending on the light, which falls under the “Green Eyes” trope. However, there are no horticultural faux pas, such as plants out of season or growing zones.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKimberly McCreight’s *Like Mother, Like Daughter* is an incredibly engaging thriller with a unique plot structure, well-developed characters, and a compelling exploration of a complex mother-daughter relationship. The alternating POVs, layered storytelling, and suspenseful mystery make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars!  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Knopf, Pantheon, Vintage and Anchor, and NetGalley for providing a free advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Hook:**  \n  The book had me from the start. The beginning effectively set up the tumultuous relationships between mother and daughter and wife and husband, which immediately drew me in.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I had strong opinions on the characters right away. The main character, Kat, is a high-powered attorney with a special talent as a \"fixer,\" which I found very intriguing. Cleo, another character, was portrayed with an entitled, clueless attitude, reminiscent of Haley from *Modern Family*, but without her sweetness.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The chapters alternated between timelines like \"4 days before,\" \"12 hours after,\" and \"1992.\" While it required careful attention to keep track, it wasn’t overly difficult to follow. This structure was a clever way to gradually reveal more information and build suspense.  \n\n- **Suspense and Twists:**  \n  The book kept me hooked with every twist and turn. After finishing, I recognized several red herrings that successfully kept me guessing until almost the end.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator for Kat had a pleasant voice and read well, though I would have preferred a less perky tone for her character. The narrator for Cleo captured her snotty demeanor perfectly, though her voice reminded me of Haley from *Modern Family*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating read with excellent suspense writing, well-developed characters, and a clever plot structure. Despite some minor issues with the audiobook narration, it was an engaging experience that kept me guessing until the very end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

Interspersed throughout are snippets of Kat’s childhood journal entries, therapy session transcripts, and articles about a lawsuit involving her. However, I wouldn’t characterize it as a true dual timeline since the narrative largely unfolds in the present.

The mother-daughter dynamic between Cleo and Kat is central to the narrative, characterized by misunderstandings and a lack of clarity regarding each other's intentions.

However, as secrets are revealed, she begins to see things more clearly, and the reality is more terrible than she imagined.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n   - The mother/daughter relationship between Cleo and Kat is central to the story, marked by misunderstandings, secrets, and not understanding each other's intentions.  \n   - The story explores how small misunderstandings can have significant consequences, making it relatable.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Timelines:**  \n   - The book has a bit of a dual timeline, primarily focusing on the week leading up to Kat's disappearance and Cleo's present-day investigation into what happened.  \n   - There are also snippets of journal entries from Kat's childhood, therapy session transcripts, and articles about a lawsuit Kat is involved in. However, I hesitate to call it a true dual timeline, as the timelines are mostly present-day.  \n\n- **Complexity and Intrigue:**  \n   - The story is clever, with many shady characters who are not necessarily all bad but certainly not good. Their actions range in severity, including affairs, business dealings, secrets, and betrayals.  \n   - The constant guessing about where characters are heading and how they fit into the bigger picture keeps the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing style is compelling and kept my attention throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a gripping and relatable exploration of family dynamics, secrets, and misunderstandings.

It was a great palate refresher after reading so many long fantasy books.  \n  - I love thrillers with female authors, which added to my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The book starts with the main protagonist missing and features two POVs: the mother before she went missing and the daughter after the event.  \n  - I was hooked right away, trying to figure out with the daughter who did it and why.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I really liked how realistic each character was. There were no black-and-white character tropes in this book.  \n  - Even the two main protagonists had their own messy pasts, making it hard to pin the blame on one person solely because they all seemed to have motives.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - I appreciated how motherhood and daughterhood were portrayed. As someone who had a rocky relationship with my own mom growing up, it brought up a lot of emotions as the plot unfolded.  \n  - It touched on how hard being a mom is when you have no idea what you’re doing, and how easy it is to pin your own insecurities on your mom as a daughter.  \n  - After finishing the book, I texted my mom and told her I love her.  \n\n- **Author and Future Interest:**  \n  - I want to read all of this author’s books now!  \n\n- **Reading Context:**  \n  - I read this as an ARC through NetGalley. The release date is July 9th, 2024.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a captivating and emotionally resonant thriller that stood out for its realistic characters, dual POV structure, and exploration of complex mother-daughter relationships. It left a lasting impression on me and inspired me to reconnect with my own mom.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel initially feels overwhelming due to its multitude of characters, plots, and subplots, along with extraneous details presented through news articles and therapist interviews. However, by the 60% mark, the story becomes engaging enough to quickly draw me into the second half. The lengthy setup prioritizes plot development over profound exploration of the main characters, Cleo and Kat. The non-linear timelines, reminiscent of a detective's board with interconnected strings, add to the complexity and make following the sequence of events difficult. Fortunately, the pacing picks up in the second half, ultimately making for a compelling read.",

I found the backstory intriguing, particularly Kat's role as a 'fixer' and Cleo's ex-boyfriend. The narrative subtly delves into the complexities of motherhood and the mother-daughter relationship, adding depth to the characters.",

The parallels drawn between Cleo and Kat enrich the narrative, adding emotional depth that elevates the story beyond a typical thriller."

It explores themes like strained mother-daughter relationships, infidelity, and trauma, including mentions of rape.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story follows Cleo, a 20-year-old daughter, who returns home to find her mother, Katrina, missing. The narrative unfolds through multiple timelines and dual first-person perspectives, alternating between past and present. While the plot wasn’t overly surprising, it had a slow-burn suspenseful quality that kept me engaged, though it occasionally gave me an \"ick factor.\"  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Cleo is portrayed as a young woman who thinks she knows it all, and her actions sometimes come off as erratic or \"crazy.\" The author effectively captures the complexities of mother-daughter relationships, showing that they aren’t always perfect but are rooted in deep love. I found the husband character unlikable, which added to the tension.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author does a good job of portraying the nuances of family relationships, avoiding clichés of idyllic bonds. The narrative style, with its shifting timelines and dual perspectives, adds depth but can feel a bit scattered at times.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The audiobook features two narrators, Olivia Campbell and Cassandra Campbell, which works well given the age differences between the characters. Cleo’s narrator sounded age-appropriate but was occasionally monotone, lacking excitement during intense or emotional moments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a solid psychological fiction novel with a slow-burn suspense that explores the complexities of mother-daughter relationships.

While the mystery of Kat's disappearance is intriguing, the additional subplots—such as her daughter's involvement with a drug dealer, the crumbling marriage with Aidan, and the sudden death of Kat's secret lover—make the narrative feel overwhelming at times.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Kat's daughter is portrayed as being tangled up in shady business, which adds depth to her character. Kat's marriage to Aidan is depicted as falling apart, and her secret lover's sudden death introduces further emotional complexity. These relationships contribute to the story's richness but also add to the narrative's density.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The story is an interesting read, with surprising twists that keep the reader engaged. However, the multiple layers and subplots can make the pacing feel uneven and, at times, overwhelming.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is somewhat lackluster, failing to fully deliver on the buildup created by the intricate plot and character dynamics.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is an engaging mystery with surprising twists and complex character relationships.

However, I found the nonlinear timeline and first-person narration style less enjoyable. While these elements may appeal to some readers, they didn't resonate with me.

            "The author presents several intriguing plot ideas, but the sheer number of them in one book can be overwhelming. The central narrative focuses on Mom Katrina and Daughter Chloe, whose strained relationship is marked by Chloe's resentment and Katrina's longing to reconnect. A compelling twist occurs when Chloe arrives for dinner to find only a bloody shoe, heightening the suspense. However, the inclusion of multiple perspectives, various plotlines, and formats—such as transcripts, therapist notes, emails, texts, and diary entries—feels excessive and detracts from the story. While the narrative becomes more engaging around the 90% mark, the lengthy buildup can be tedious. Although I typically enjoy twisty plots, this one felt overly complicated. The pacing improves significantly toward the end, but the journey to that point is drawn out and at times laborious.",

Despite these issues, the reviewer remains optimistic about the author’s future projects.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the reviewer implies it falls short of their usual five-star rating for the author’s works."

However, she became much more tolerable later on, but it took a lot of eye-opening moments and secrets being revealed for her character to grow on me.  \n\n- **Plot Structure (Dual Timeline):**  \n  I loved the dual timeline aspect of this novel.

While some of these elements felt unnecessary, others (like the news stories about Darden) provided crucial information that enhanced the plot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my initial frustration with Cleo, I ultimately enjoyed this read. The twisted mystery and the way the story unfolded kept me engaged, especially once I got past Cleo's early chapters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a good mystery with a compelling dual timeline and some interesting use of mixed media.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations and Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - I was excited for *Like Mother, Like Daughter*, hoping it would be as compelling as *Reconstructing Amelia*.  \n   - McCreight might be a victim of her debut success, as readers like me continue to expect something equally gripping.  \n\n- **Character Development and Sympathy:**  \n   - The novel is told from the perspectives of Kat (a missing mom) and her college-age daughter Cleo, with additional notes from Cleo’s therapy sessions and news reports.  \n   - Neither Kat nor Cleo had much personality or felt particularly sympathetic.  \n   - Kat’s childhood circumstances were sad, but because they were told rather than shown, I didn’t *feel* the characters.  \n\n- **World-Building and Writing Style:**  \n   - I enjoyed McCreight’s world-building, which was the strongest aspect of the novel.  \n   - The story read more like a YA novel than an adult mystery, as the young protagonist (Cleo) was savvier than the police and solved the mystery herself.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n   - The novel was described as a love letter to mothers and daughters, but that’s not how I would characterize it.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Expectations:**  \n   - I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I had hoped.  \n   - However, I’m not giving up on McCreight as an author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Like Mother, Like Daughter* had strong world-building, it fell short in character development and emotional resonance, making it less compelling than McCreight’s debut. The story leaned more toward YA than adult mystery, and the characters lacked depth and sympathy. Despite my disappointment, I remain hopeful for McCreight’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is presented through two non-linear perspectives—mother and daughter—which initially holds promise but ultimately becomes confusing due to the inclusion of various formats like texts and articles. While the final 15% of the book gains momentum, it feels anti-climactic, relying heavily on exposition rather than engaging the reader through action. The daughter's decision to solve the case independently, without involving the seemingly competent cop, is frustrating. Additionally, the subplot involving the drug dealer boyfriend lacks resolution. \n\nThe narrative feels cluttered, with too many subplots introduced—such as the mother's boyfriend's death, a drug company, the husband's affair, and a random neighbor—yet it simultaneously lacks significant developments. For the first half of the book, the plot is unclear, with the only certainty being the mother's disappearance. The random chapters featuring texts, news articles, and therapy transcripts add to the confusion and lack context, making it difficult to follow the story's direction."

The only clear detail was that the mom was missing.  \n   - There were too many subplots and elements introduced (e.g., the mom’s boyfriend dying, a drug company, the husband’s affair, the daughter’s drug dealer boyfriend, a random neighbor), making it hard to follow or guess the direction of the story.  \n   - Random chapters with texts, news articles, and therapy transcripts were confusing and lacked context.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The story was told from two non-linear points of view (mom and daughter), which could have been interesting but became overly confusing with the inclusion of additional formats like texts and articles.  \n\n- **Climax and Resolution:**  \n   - The last 15% of the book picked up pace but felt anti-climactic.  \n   - The resolution relied heavily on telling rather than showing, which was disappointing.  \n   - The daughter solving the case on her own without involving the cop (who seemed like the only good character) was frustrating.  \n   - There was no closure for the drug dealer boyfriend subplot.  \n\n- **Overall Plot Cohesion:**  \n   - The story felt like it had too much going on, yet simultaneously, nothing significant seemed to happen.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing concept, its execution was flawed.

The premise of a 19-year-old investigating her mother’s disappearance rather than leaving it to the police feels unrealistic and poorly executed.

As she investigates her mother’s life, she uncovers long-hidden secrets. While I appreciated the dual perspectives of Kat and Cleo, the plot became overly complicated with too many threads: Kat’s secret career, Cleo’s drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, Kat’s marriage, two timelines, and multiple points of view. This complexity muddled the story, making it ultimately forgettable.",

            "The author introduces numerous red herrings and subplots, including the suspicious death of a man Kat liked, a challenging legal case, volatile clients, diary excerpts from Kat's traumatic childhood, legal documents, and counseling session transcripts. These elements often felt confusing and unnecessary, failing to significantly advance the mystery's resolution. A recurring theme in the author's work is the complex relationships between mothers and daughters. In this story, Cleo, a NYU student, returns home to find her house in disarray and her mother missing, prompting her to channel her inner Nancy Drew. However, the revelations she uncovers may not be what she hoped for. The abundance of red herrings and unlikable supporting characters diminished the overall suspense. While the book is not without merit, it lacks genuine tension and demands a high tolerance for implausible plot points.",
            "The entire family is strikingly beautiful, with supporting characters often remarking on their looks—such as calling Kat a \"babe\" and noting Cleo's resemblance to her mother. However, each member harbors secrets: Aidan is unfaithful, Kat pretends to be a lawyer while playing the role of a fixer, and Cleo struggles with her choice in men.",
            "I used to read this author regularly, but I eventually stopped because her novels began to feel repetitive.",
            "The plot hinges on numerous coincidences, including the villain's encounter with Cleo and a series of unfortunate events unfolding within a single week. This reliance on chance makes it difficult for me to suspend disbelief. However, the premise of a mother-daughter relationship intrigued me, prompting me to give this author another chance."

While the premise was intriguing, the plot was weighed down by excessive red herrings, unlikable characters, and a reliance on coincidences that strained believability. The book may appeal to readers who can easily suspend disbelief, but it falls short in delivering genuine suspense.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Narration/Audio Performance:**  \n  I did not enjoy the readers of the audio version. Their performance did not resonate with me and detracted from my overall experience.  \n\n- **Target Audience/Tone:**  \n  The book read like a Teen novel. I am not sure if it is officially categorized in the Teen genre, but the tone and style felt more suited for a younger audience.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I would not have chosen this book if it had been marketed as a Teen novel. The mismatch between my expectations and the actual content contributed to my dissatisfaction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did not enjoy this book. The audio narration and the Teen-like tone were significant factors in my negative experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."
