It's a trope that I can't resist, and it gets me every time.  \n\n- **Sexual Content:**  \n  A lot of the sex scenes were really weird to me, and I ended up skim-reading most of them.

The concept of the women's bellies extending with the men's sperm and a \"plug\" being placed to keep the sperm inside, making their bellies look pregnant, was just too bizarre for my taste.

The narrative is unnecessarily stretched into a duet instead of being condensed into a single, more focused 300-page book. This lack of plot and repetitive character behavior negatively impacts the pacing.",

Despite her frequent complaints about her morals, she abandons them after just a month with the male main character (MMC). Additionally, her interactions with other characters feel unrealistic, as they treat her as if she can do no wrong, which seems inconsistent and unearned.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Series Completion:**  \n  I appreciate that this is a completed series from Ms. Cain, which is a refreshing change from her other works that often leave readers waiting for sequels.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The duology features a familiar dynamic seen in her other books: a young, oppressed virgin heroine (22) paired with an older, powerful hero (146). The power-exchange dynamic is central to their relationship, which aligns with her usual storytelling style.\n\n- **Hero's Characterization:**  \n  Compared to her other male leads, this hero is tamer. He is also a virgin, remains faithful, and only commits one act of non-consensual behavior. Despite his flaws, he \"loves\" the heroine in his own unique way.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The first book in the duology is stronger than the second, which felt less compelling in comparison.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this duology, as it carries the same flavor as Ms. Cain's other works while introducing a slightly more restrained hero. While the first book stands out as the better of the two, the series as a whole is a satisfying read for fans of her writing style.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
