Her life takes a turn when a man moves nearby, introducing new tension and complexity to her situation.",

The narrative boldly embraces its unsettling nature, creating a dark, claustrophobic atmosphere that is both creepy and violent. It unfolds like a waking nightmare, particularly as the protagonist gradually loses her grip on reality."

While the pacing aligns with the theme of an unreliable narrator and growing paranoia, it felt repetitive, which made the execution fall flat. The lack of surprises and the disappointing pace made the overall experience just okay.  \n\n- **Concept and Themes:**  \n  I liked the general concept of a horrendous virus that makes people go on murderous rampages once they look someone in the eyes. It’s uncomfortable and terrifying, especially as it mirrors the isolation and fear experienced during the COVID pandemic. The idea of the virus itself gave me chills, particularly when thinking about its implications for families and children, even though these aspects weren’t explicitly explored in the book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot:**  \n  The story revolves around a character who is unsure if she’s going mad in an already mad world. The uncertainty about how the virus works and whether it mutates adds to the tension, as we’re left questioning if her experiences are due to a mental breakdown or the infection. The growing paranoia was interesting but became repetitive over time.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book doesn’t shy away from gory scenes and various triggers, which added to the unsettling atmosphere. However, the repetitive nature of the paranoia and the lack of surprises made the tone feel monotonous after a while.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novella had a chilling and relevant concept, the slow pacing, repetitive execution, and lack of surprises made it just an okay read for me.

However, this marketing approach might set up unrealistic expectations for readers, leading to disappointment in the plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Scope:**  \n  The story is a psychologically heavy novella told from the first-person perspective of an isolated girl who is slowly losing her mind.
