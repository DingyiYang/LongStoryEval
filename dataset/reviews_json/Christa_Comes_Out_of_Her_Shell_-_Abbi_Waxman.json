When her father suddenly resurfaces, Christa returns to LA to confront reporters, fans, and family turmoil.

            "Christa Liddle is a captivating narrator whose gradual openness reflects her real-life struggles with vulnerability. Her journey from reclusiveness to self-expression is beautifully symbolized by her affection for snails and her emergence from her shell. The romantic subplot with Nate is delicately woven throughout the narrative, emphasizing their friendship and the tension of \"will they, won’t they\" without overshadowing the main storyline.",
            "This story exudes a warm and witty tone, blending humor with introspection. Despite tackling heavy themes, it strikes a balance between drama and light-hearted moments, offering a thoughtful exploration of self-discovery and personal growth. While the frequent humorous footnotes add charm, they can disrupt the flow, especially in digital formats. Each chapter is introduced with delightful illustrations of whimsical creatures alongside their scientific names, lending a playful touch. The narrative is enriched by news article titles that reflect the media's take on the Jasper Liddle saga. Additionally, moments where Christa breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge her role as the narrator introduce an intriguing meta layer to the storytelling.",
            "This novel deftly navigates complex family dynamics, the tension between past and future, and confronts heavy themes of sexual assault alongside a romantic subplot. Beginning with a light-hearted tone, it evolves into a profound bildungsroman that unravels Christa's dysfunctional family and the impacts of her father's narcissism. The narrative also explores her mother's coping mechanisms following Jasper's disappearance, Christa's experience of feeling like the black sheep compared to her sisters, and her romantic relationship, which, while present, serves as a secondary thread to the main plot.",
            "Though the narrative starts off somewhat stiff, it becomes increasingly engaging as it unfolds. The charming footnotes and illustrations may be better appreciated in print than in digital form. Overall, the book resonates deeply with readers, providing a poignant exploration of family, romance, and self-discovery."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a departure from the author's usual cozy prose, delving into deeper and more complex themes while maintaining her signature warmth and humor. Christa's journey of self-discovery, set against the backdrop of her dysfunctional family and a rekindled romance, is both touching and thought-provoking. Despite some initial challenges with the narrative style, the story ultimately captivates, leaving readers satisfied and reflective.",

            "The story starts slowly but quickly gains momentum with engaging family drama and themes of character redemption. The blend of humor, romance, and emotional conflict makes for an enjoyable read. The rekindled romance between Christa and Nate is both cute and heartfelt, adding a charming layer to the narrative. Their interactions stand out, enhancing the book's overall appeal. The novel successfully weaves together elements of dysfunctional family dynamics, a quirky second-chance romance, and sharp comedy, resulting in a heartwarming and entertaining tale. Central to the plot is Dr. Christa Liddle, who must confront her estranged father, reunite with her mother and sisters, and navigate unresolved family issues while reigniting her romance with Nate.",
            "The main characters are well-developed, endearing, and relatable, each grappling with their own inner struggles. Christa's journey through addiction and childhood trauma lends depth to her character, although her age and credentials as a doctor and marine biologist can feel somewhat implausible. The depiction of sister-mother relationships is both authentic and insightful, adding significant emotional weight to the narrative.",

            "The story's premise is striking: a famous TV naturalist, presumed dead for 25 years, suddenly returns, and his daughter, who has isolated herself for years, must confront this shocking reality. While the setup may seem implausible, it often serves as a backdrop for humor, featuring absurdities like Liddle’s Liddles Beanie Baby knockoffs and late-night TV antics. Beneath the surface, the narrative delves into themes of abandonment, family dysfunction, and the quest for healing broken bonds. Christa’s emotional journey of facing her past and deciding whether to forgive her family is particularly poignant. Although the book is charming and heartfelt, it doesn't quite match the author's previous works in depth and impact. The execution is solid, but it lacks the heights of the author’s other novels.",

            "The book's chaotic structure surprisingly enhances its charm. It follows Christa, a reclusive sea snail researcher on a remote island, whose life is upended when her mother reveals that her long-lost father has been located after 25 years. The engaging plot captivated me so thoroughly that I finished it in a single day.",
            "In this story, the main character, Christa, is a female scientist, which I found refreshing. Her background as the daughter of a moderately famous naturalist adds depth to her character, particularly in how she navigates the complexities of semi-fame. The love interest is charming, and their relationship is heartwarming, though it may not fully satisfy those seeking a more traditional rom-com.",
            "The book's initial description left me skeptical, but I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. Although marketed as a rom-com, it predominantly explores family drama, trauma, and healing. While the romance is enjoyable, the stronger and more compelling elements are the family's dynamics and the journey toward healing."

I wish there were more scenes dedicated to the interactions among the Liddle women, as this would have further emphasized themes of forgiveness and personal redemption.

The introduction of amnesia and a one-dimensional villain further detracts from the story’s realism. Instead of delving into the complexities of Christa's fractured family relationships and her personal growth, the narrative fixates on the chaotic events surrounding her father. While the story hints at romantic comedy, it falls short of the humor and charm typically expected from the genre.",

However, her flaws—such as being prickly, quick-tempered, emotionally closed off, and rude—ultimately overshadow her potential for likability. Throughout the novel, she experiences little character growth and her tendency to evade problems goes unaddressed. Even by the end, she continues to make self-serving decisions. The dynamics surrounding her father’s return lack depth, as her initial resistance and later acceptance feel rushed. Additionally, her unresolved emotional turmoil related to his disappearance and the ensuing media attention is merely skimmed over.",

            "The story suffers from logical inconsistencies, particularly in Christa's contradictory remarks about Jasper's fame and her own choices, such as framing her education at Princeton as running. Additionally, the portrayal of Christa's career—characterized by positive press yet poor television reception—doesn't match how others perceive her, as evidenced by comments suggesting she'd excel on TV despite lacking supporting evidence.",
            "Christa's character exhibits notable inconsistencies throughout the story. Despite her claim of being an early riser, she is frequently depicted waking up around noon. While she initially holds a tough persona, this is undermined by her submissive behavior later in the book, seemingly shaped by her mother's overbearing nature. The portrayal of her trauma—being roofied with intent to rape—raises concerns, especially as her family mocks her startle reflex, which she describes as embarrassing. Additionally, the male characters, particularly Nate, rely on overly dramatic and clichéd dialogue, particularly in romantic scenes, rendering them unconvincing. Lastly, the depiction of Gen Z characters comes across as stereotypical and uninspired.",

The central question of whether she can uphold her dignity amidst the chaos adds significant depth to the narrative.",

Although Christa's age doesn't fully align with her circumstances, I was so captivated by the story and its characters that these discrepancies didn't detract from my enjoyment.

Jesse Vilinsky and Jonathan Todd Ross did a fantastic job as narrators. Vilinsky sounded a bit young for Christa’s character, but since Christa is only in her mid to late 20s, her voice ultimately fit perfectly.\n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  There is some spice and more romance than I expected, but the banter between Christa and Nathan was adorable. I found myself rooting for them to become a couple.\n\n- **Book Design and Annotations:**  \n  The book includes annotations, which I found to be a nice touch. Additionally, each chapter has a unique, mostly animal-related title with its scientific name listed below, adding a creative element to the reading experience.\n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  Despite the book’s many great qualities, I felt something was missing, though I can’t quite pinpoint what it was. I also wish it had been about 50 pages shorter, as the pacing could have been tighter.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* is an entertaining and interesting read.

Additionally, Davis’s ability to get away with his sleazy behavior stood out as a notable point. Overall, the book felt disjointed and would have benefited from editing to enhance narrative coherence.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Writing Style and Consistency:**  \n  I’ve been a fan of Abbi Waxman’s writing since 2018. Her novel *Other People’s Houses* was a Book of the Month pick early that year, and I ended up absolutely loving it. This new book, *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell*, still has the classic Abbi charm, quirkiness, and humor that I love, but it just wasn’t as strong as her others.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The novel had a lot of ups and downs for me. It didn’t grab my attention at first, but it really gained momentum once the family drama got started. I went through spurts of inhaling it, then becoming a tad bored with the storyline, and then back to gobbling it up again. However, by the conclusion, it lost most of its steam and had me rolling my eyes a bit.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I adored the female protagonist, Christa Liddle, and her quirky personality. I’d describe her as adorably nerdy. She’s an introverted scientist studying sea snails, living her best life in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The character growth displayed by Christa was a highlight—no doubt about it, she comes out of her shell.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n  I loved all of the family drama, dysfunction, and the strong focus on sisterhood. The story really picks up when Christa gets shocking news about her father and heads back home to be with her family.  \n\n- **Recommendation for New Readers:**  \n  If Abbi Waxman is a new author to you, I highly recommend starting with a few of her earlier novels, like *Other People’s Houses* and *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* wasn’t my favorite from Abbi Waxman, it still has her signature charm and humor. The story had its moments of brilliance, especially in the family drama and character growth, but it didn’t maintain its momentum throughout. I’ll still read anything she writes!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars for *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell*."

I loved her voice, the way she spoke to herself and to us directly, and the footnotes were really fun!  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  The family dynamic was complex. The relationships between Christa, her sisters, and her parents were complicated, sometimes hurtful, but always evolving.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful blend of humor and heart, with a standout protagonist and a richly layered family dynamic. It kept me engaged and emotionally invested throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development (Christa):**  \n   - I never really liked Christa, and since the story centered on her, there wasn’t much else to turn to.  \n   - I understand she was a pivotal character with a rough childhood, but her arc felt like a \"poor little rich girl\" story with an added academic obsession to give her Nina Hill-esque vibes.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - The romance felt forced and unnecessary.  \n   - I would have preferred more focus on Christa coming out of her shell with her family instead.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Family Dynamics:**  \n   - There were many family members and supporting characters, but they got very little page time.  \n   - I wish the story had explored her family relationships more deeply.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n   - There were quite a few unnecessary and predictable plot points that dragged the story down.  \n   - Davis didn’t need to be the villain he was to move the story forward or help Christa evolve.  \n   - Her father’s role as an adulterer felt unnecessary; a more romantic or nuanced backstory would have been better.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n   - The book was well-written, and there were some interesting parts.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Loyalty to the Author:**  \n   - This wasn’t my favorite Waxman novel by a long shot.  \n   - I took much longer to read this book than usual, which speaks volumes since I normally finish a Waxman novel in a couple of days.  \n   - I would have given it 2 stars if it weren’t for my loyalty to the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was well-written and had some interesting moments, it fell short of my expectations. The main character, Christa, was unlikable, the romance felt forced, and the plot included unnecessary and predictable elements. The lack of focus on family dynamics and supporting characters further detracted from the story. Despite my loyalty to the author, this wasn’t a standout novel for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 2 stars (with an extra star added due to loyalty to the author)."

            "The story centers on Christa Liddle, a scientist researching snails in the Indian Ocean, whose life is thrown into chaos when her long-dead father, Jasper Liddle, mysteriously reappears. The plot is delightfully quirky, adding to the overall charm of the narrative. Despite its unconventional premise, the story effectively weaves a unique and engaging tale within its context.",
            "The characters are vibrant and quirky, drawing readers into the narrative. Christa, the protagonist, is depicted as a chaotic yet intelligent character, a portrayal skillfully enhanced by the use of footnotes. However, by the story's conclusion, there is a marked absence of substantial character growth for Christa, which may leave some readers craving deeper development.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story revolves around Christa Liddle, a scientist studying snails in the Indian Ocean, whose life is turned upside down when her long-dead father, Jasper Liddle, mysteriously returns. The plot is described as \"ridiculously out there\" and \"zany,\" which adds to the story's charm. While the premise is unconventional, it works well within the context of the novel, creating a unique and engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are \"fun and quirky,\" and the author does an excellent job of making readers feel like they are part of the story. Christa, the protagonist, is portrayed with a \"chaotic, brainy mind,\" which is effectively conveyed through the use of footnotes. However, by the end of the story, there is a noticeable lack of significant character growth for Christa, which might leave some readers wanting more development.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author employs a lighthearted and humorous tone, fitting for a rom-com. The use of footnotes to reflect Christa's thought process is a creative touch that adds depth to her character and enhances the storytelling. The writing style complements the \"silly and fun\" nature of the book, making it an enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The reviewer notes that this book is \"very different\" from *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*, which might surprise fans of that novel. While it shares some quirky elements, the tone and plot are distinct, so readers should adjust their expectations accordingly.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its unconventional and \"bonkers\" plot, the reviewer found the book to be a \"silly and fun read.\" The story's absurdity is part of its appeal, and the reviewer appreciated the lighthearted and entertaining nature of the novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a zany and unconventional rom-com with a quirky cast of characters and a plot that defies expectations. While the protagonist's lack of growth might be a drawback for some, the story's humor and creativity make it an enjoyable and entertaining read.

Waxman’s ability to create lovable characters and balance heavy themes with lighthearted moments makes it a standout read. The audiobook narration adds an extra layer of enjoyment, making it a highly recommended experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing occasionally drags, and a few unresolved plot points leave lingering questions. Certain characters can be infuriating, making me wish I could \"slap some sense into them.\" The narrative follows Christa as she grapples with past traumas and present challenges, delving into her relationships with family, fame, work, and her own expectations for life.",
            "In Abbi Waxman's novel, Christa stands out as an intelligent and introspective character, grappling with both internal conflicts and external pressures. This depth of characterization aligns perfectly with my expectations from Waxman, showcasing her talent for creating relatable and complex figures.",
            "A blend of humor, sweetness, heartbreak, and depth, this story skillfully navigates the balance between light and heavy emotions.",
            "The story is emotionally resonant, offering a deep exploration of Christa’s life and relationships.",
            "This book marks a departure from the author’s typical style, which usually centers around quirky found families. Instead, it delves into the dynamics of a slightly dysfunctional biological family. While romance is present, it remains a minor thread in the narrative. The primary focus is on Christa’s personal journey and her complex relationships."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* is a unique and entertaining book with the depth of character and emotional complexity I’ve come to expect from Abbi Waxman. While it has some pacing issues and unresolved elements, it’s a heartfelt and thought-provoking read.",

When he suddenly reappears, the family is thrust into the spotlight, a situation that seems to bring him joy at the expense of others. However, Christa’s resolution at the end is satisfying and resonates with what I appreciate in modern romance.",

Initially, it took me a few chapters to fully understand her character, but her growth and unique quirks ultimately made her memorable. The portrayal of family dynamics, particularly the sibling relationships, is a standout aspect of the story. Additionally, the romantic subplot, which develops from an unrequited crush into a mutual connection on their second meeting, adds both charm and depth to the narrative.",

            "The novel features three interconnected plotlines centered on Christa's journey of self-discovery. The main storyline follows Christa as her presumed-dead celebrity father re-enters her life, challenging her to navigate complex family dynamics and the pressures of media attention. A romantic subplot unfolds between Christa and Nate, a childhood friend; their relationship feels refreshing, even within the familiar rom-com framework. The third plotline delves into Christa's interactions with her mother and sisters, examining their evolving understanding of one another. The first 87 pages are particularly strong, setting a high standard for the narrative. While the pacing does slow in later sections, the story remains engaging, with a balanced mix of romantic and familial themes complementing the more intense celebrity storyline.",

The author's talent for portraying relationships, especially among women, shines throughout the novel, making these interactions a true highlight.",
            "The writing is witty, engaging, and humor-filled, reminiscent of authors like Christopher Buckley and Dave Barry. The first-person narration is effective, although it sometimes includes intimate details that may discomfort some readers. Overall, the tone strikes a balance between humor and heartfelt moments, resulting in a warm and enjoyable reading experience.",

            "The romance between Christa and Nate is heartfelt and elegantly crafted, infused with charm that enhances the story. While some scenes may delve into details that could feel excessive to certain readers, this does not significantly diminish the overall quality."

The author's signature wit and ability to craft relatable, complex characters shine through, making this a standout read.

They are consistently engaging and well-crafted, which is one of the reasons I enjoy her work.  \n\n- **Storyline:**  \n  The storyline in this book felt off to me. I didn’t connect with it as much as I had hoped, possibly because I started the book and then went on a beach vacation where I didn’t listen to audiobooks for a whole week. This break might have disrupted my immersion in the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I wasn’t remotely prepared for a rape scene (or almost rape scene). A trigger warning would have been helpful, as I wished I had known about this content before starting the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I still appreciate Waxman’s talent for creating compelling characters and settings, the storyline in this book didn’t resonate with me as strongly as I expected.

At its heart, the narrative focuses on Christa and her family as they work to heal their relationships. Their deep love for one another shines through, despite past mistakes from Christa's childhood. It’s heartwarming to see them unite, even as they navigate the complexities of reconciliation. Nathan and Leo enrich the family dynamic; while I wished for more of Leo, he consistently offered support when needed. Nathan, the love interest, provides a comforting presence and serves as a witness to Christa's greatest shame, kept secret from the reader. This secrecy felt unnecessary, especially since other characters were already aware of it.",

            "The story's pacing is generally effective; however, some subplots feel rushed or unresolved, impacting overall coherence. The ending leaves several loose ends, particularly concerning Jasper's past and the family's future. Central to the narrative is Christa, a scientist studying snails on a remote island. Her tranquil life is upended when she discovers that her father, Jasper Liddle—a former TV star—has been alive and wishes to reconnect after 25 years. This intriguing premise thrusts Christa and her family into the spotlight, generating tension and drama. Additionally, a romantic subplot involving Nate, a childhood friend, adds emotional depth yet complicates Christa's longing for a return to her simpler way of life.",
            "Christa is a quirky, introverted character grappling with her family's complex dynamics and past scandals. While the Liddle family, including Christa’s mother and sisters, is portrayed with depth, their development occasionally feels inconsistent. Jasper plays a central role in the story, yet his motives and backstory remain underexplored, leaving some questions unanswered.",
            "The author’s writing is warm and engaging, skillfully crafting relatable, flawed characters. The tone balances humor with emotional depth; however, the story occasionally leans into overly zany territory, resulting in some unresolved subplots.",
            "The story explores themes of family reconciliation, personal identity, and the tension between public and private life. The emotional depth is particularly felt in Christa's internal struggles and her relationship with Nate, although some moments could benefit from further development."

        "conclusion": "While *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill* remains a favorite, this novel by the author offers a quirky and engaging story with flawed, relatable characters. However, it occasionally strays into zany territory with unresolved subplots and inconsistent character development. Despite these flaws, it’s a fun and emotionally resonant read.",

The lengthy sex scenes were a new addition; while some readers may appreciate them, I personally prefer to avoid such content in romcoms. It seems the author might have drawn inspiration from the popularity of writers like Ali Hazelwood.",

Additionally, the public and media's indifference to these events further diminished the story's credibility.",

            "Christa’s relationship with Nate, her long-time family friend and teenage crush, stands out in the book. However, it is primarily classified as women’s fiction rather than romance, emphasizing Christa’s personal growth and family dynamics.",
            "The author skillfully crafts engaging characters who navigate the complexities of their past and present. Christa's transformation from an unconventional childhood to a rebellious teenager and ultimately to a celebrated scientist is both well-developed and compelling. The depiction of Christa's mother as a strong, resilient figure throughout the years is especially commendable. The book also explores the intricate dynamics within Christa's immediate family, highlighting the various roles she and her sisters occupy, both past and present. Although the complexity of these relationships can be challenging to fully grasp, it enriches the narrative.",
            "The portrayal of LA alongside the remote island where Christa conducts her research creates a compelling backdrop for the story. This contrasting environment enhances the narrative and offers a vivid sense of place.",
            "The story is engaging and enjoyable, with a captivating plot that kept me hooked. The conversational tone and personal asides added an intimate touch, making Christa’s journey a delight to follow."

            "*Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* opens powerfully, with an intriguing protagonist: Christa, a former child star-turned-scientist living on an island and studying snails. The main plot, revolving around the return of her father after 20 years, is highly engaging and deserves more focus than the romance subplot. While Nate is a decent character, I found the romantic storyline lacking depth—there simply wasn't enough chemistry to justify its prominence in the narrative. Additionally, the love scenes felt unexpectedly racy and came across as forced and unnatural, detracting from the overall story.",
            "The characters in her stories are often quirky yet relatable, with many feeling like real people. I particularly enjoy how she gives voice to the pets, making them some of my favorite characters.",
            "I appreciate the author's writing style, which uniquely balances biting wit with a touch of sweetness. As the Emily Giffin quote on the cover suggests, she is both irreverent and thoughtful, a description I wholeheartedly agree with.",
            "This story is filled with great quotes, as is often the case. Unfortunately, since it was a library book, I couldn't highlight any passages. One particularly amusing line was about Marcel the dachshund, who is described as more than just an evil little bratwurst. Here are two additional quotes I noted:  \n- “Call me, which is honestly the most annoying text in the history of communication. Tell me more, and maybe I will. But order me to call you, and my answer is going to be Make me.”  \n- “Someone doesn’t need to be physically present to have an impact—far from it. In fact, as evidenced by the billions who adhere to messianic world religions, sometimes being dead is actually helpful if you’re seeking an unassailable reputation.”"

The family dynamics are both dysfunctional and amusing, occasionally bordering on the absurd, which keeps the story lively. Christa's journey of self-discovery—emphasizing leaving the past behind and finding her voice—is compelling and gratifying.

Having adored *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*, I was eager to dive into this book, expecting a similarly engaging and heartwarming read.\n\n- **Characters and Characterization:**  \n  Waxman excels at creating zany, memorable characters. Christa, a snail-studying scientist living a solitary life on a remote island, is delightfully awkward, especially in social situations. Her quirky thought process, often highlighted in footnotes, added humor and depth to her character. The family dynamics were both dysfunctional and comical, though occasionally veered into the absurd, keeping the story lively and entertaining.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Christa’s growth is a standout strength of the book. Her journey of self-discovery, focusing on leaving the past behind and finding her voice, was compelling and satisfying. By the end, she truly “came out of her shell,” making her evolution a highlight of the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Waxman’s talent for crafting warm, entertaining storylines shines through once again. While *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill* remains my favorite of her works, this book continues to showcase her ability to blend humor, heart, and family drama seamlessly.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The dual narration by Jesse Vilinsky and Jonathan Todd Ross elevated the audiobook experience. Vilinsky’s portrayal of Christa was genuine and vibrant, perfectly capturing her eccentricities and keeping me fully engaged. Ross’s delivery of the “In the News” segments felt authentic and added a layer of realism to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a charming and humorous exploration of family, self-discovery, and personal growth. While it occasionally leans into the absurd, the quirky characters, heartfelt moments, and strong character development make it an enjoyable read.

However, the subplot involving her father—his elusive manager, the absurd press, and eccentric fans—failed to resonate with me. The explanation for his disappearance felt unconvincing and detracted from the overall narrative.

            "The instalust and instalove between Christa and Nathan feel frustratingly unrealistic. Despite knowing each other for only a week, they quickly resort to calling each other \"baby\" and declaring their love. This led me to skim over the romance scenes in disappointment; the book could have easily been a 4-star read without this subplot. Additionally, the moment where Nathan wheels Christa in a child's wagon into her house and bedroom comes off as absurd and unnecessary. The subplot involving Alex Dutton, the reporter, feels extraneous and could have been removed without impacting the story. However, the main narrative—exploring themes like a missing father returning from the dead, the cost of fame, the eccentricities of Hollywood, and healing from grief and trauma—remains solid and engaging.",
            "Christa, the 27-year-old protagonist, possesses a PhD, four years of field experience, and a tenure offer, which seems unrealistic for her age; she would more likely be in her early 30s. The portrayal of Gen Z characters comes across as exaggerated and overly stereotypical. Additionally, the Hollywood agent's character is excessively villainous, aiding a client in faking his death and covering it up for 25 years, reminiscent of a Bond villain.",

They’ve known each other for only a week, yet they’re already calling each other \"baby\" and professing love.\n  - The romance scenes were skimmed due to frustration, and the book would have been a 4-star read without this subplot.\n  - The scene where Nathan wheels Christa in a child's wagon into her house and bedroom felt absurd and unnecessary.\n\n- **Dialogue and Humor:**\n  - The romantic line, \"we tessellate, baby,\" was so cringeworthy it elicited laughter rather than emotional connection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel has a strong foundation with its exploration of grief, trauma, and Hollywood's eccentricities, but it is undermined by unrealistic characterizations, an over-the-top villain, and a poorly executed romance subplot. While Abbi Waxman's writing style is enjoyable, the book's flaws, particularly the instalove and absurd romantic moments, detract from its potential.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Wavers between 2 and 3 stars.

As an introvert and over-thinker with a similar sense of humor, I found it refreshing to see characters who mirrored my mindset. Christa, the main character, has a witty anti-social inner monologue that I thoroughly enjoyed. Although I felt that the romantic interest, Will, could have been developed further, I appreciated the genuine awkwardness in their encounters.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n   - The story follows a marine biologist who moves to a fictional island, Violetta, in the Indian Ocean, seeking solitude after a tumultuous childhood.  \n   - The plot thickens when her father, a former media star presumed dead for 25 years, reappears, dragging her back into the chaos of family drama and media frenzy.  \n   - The narrative explores themes of greed, sensationalism, and the clash between personal privacy and public curiosity.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The protagonist is a relatable, nerdy marine biologist with a passion for bubble raft snails, and her backstory of surviving a childhood in the limelight adds depth.  \n   - The father’s reappearance introduces tension and complexity to the family dynamic.  \n   - A childhood friend reenters her life as a love interest, described as very handsome, adding a romantic subplot.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The writing is described as \"very good,\" though it lacks the \"insightful turns of phrase\" found in the author’s previous works, such as *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*.  \n   - The tone leans more toward romance than comedy, with less humor than expected for a Waxman romcom.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The book is highly engaging, as I read it in two sittings and enjoyed it thoroughly.  \n   - The inclusion of marine biology factoids adds an interesting layer to the story, though the romantic elements dominate the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n   - The story touches on themes of family, media exploitation, and personal identity, though it prioritizes romance over deeper exploration of these ideas.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an enjoyable, fast-paced read with a strong romantic focus and a unique marine biology backdrop. While it lacks the sharp wit and depth of the author’s previous works, it remains engaging and entertaining, making it a solid choice for fans of contemporary romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Engagement: 9/10  \n- Writing Quality: 7/10  \n- Character Development: 8/10  \n- Humor: 5/10  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 8/10"

            "The narrative voice is witty and engaging, offering an insightful glimpse into Christa’s personality. The accurate representation of Los Angeles adds authenticity to the story. I initially perceived Christa as being in her early thirties, which suited her character well; however, near the end, it's revealed that she is 27. This creates a timeline inconsistency, especially since she is a fourth-year postdoc in biology—a field where a PhD typically takes at least five years to complete. Moreover, her advisor's claim of having “three PhDs” feels more like a comic book exaggeration. A more believable interpretation would be to suggest that his PhD is exceptionally strong, allowing him to conduct solid research across multiple areas.",
            "This book places a stronger emphasis on romance than the author’s previous works. While I appreciated the romantic aspects, I found the most compelling elements to be the family dynamics, Christa's introspection about her desires and fears, and the storyline involving Jasper and the paparazzi."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, the book lived up to my expectations from the author. The witty narrative, engaging character development, and exploration of themes beyond romance made it a compelling read. While there were minor inconsistencies with character age and academic details, they didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment of the story.",

It was refreshing to see LA accurately represented, which added to the authenticity of the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Focus:**  \n  This book is more romance-focused compared to Waxman’s previous works. While I enjoyed the romance, I found the other elements—such as the family relationships, Christa’s introspection about her desires and fears, and the Jasper and paparazzi storyline—to be the best parts of the book.  \n\n- **Character Age and Academic Details:**  \n  For most of the book, I thought Christa was 30-32, which felt appropriate for her character. However, towards the end, it’s mentioned that she’s 27. Given that she’s a fourth-year postdoc in biology (a field where a PhD typically takes at least five years), the timeline feels inconsistent. Additionally, her advisor having “three PhDs” is an unrealistic comic book trope. A more plausible interpretation is that his PhD is so strong that he has solid research in three different areas.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book lived up to my expectations from Waxman. The witty narrative, engaging character development, and exploration of themes beyond romance made it a compelling read. While there were minor inconsistencies with character age and academic details, they didn’t detract significantly from my enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The premise is compelling, delving into Christa's struggle to reconcile her father's mysterious disappearance and her return to the public eye.

Her journey of growth and the rekindling of a romantic relationship with an old friend enrich her character significantly. In contrast, Jasper comes across as deeply flawed and unlikable. His abrupt reappearance after 25 years, as if nothing has changed, diminishes his role in the story.",

            "The story is narrated in the first person by Christa, who has fled her dysfunctional family and troubled past. The plot centers on her return to a chaotic family life that is largely beyond her control. Unlike *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*, this narrative places a stronger emphasis on romance, which I found enjoyable. It delves into Christa's struggles with her past decisions, her father's abandonment, her sisters' mistreatment, and her mother's lack of empathy. Christa is compelled to return when her presumed-dead father unexpectedly reappears, seeking reconciliation. While most characters find closure by the end, the resolution feels lacking, especially regarding Christa’s relationships with her family. The ending suggests a potential continuation, leaving several narrative threads unresolved.",

            "I enjoyed the romance in the story, particularly the standout character, Jordan, the agent’s assistant—I’d vote for him as king of the world. The humorous and quirky descriptions of the main character's tattoos on page 272, especially the hagfish, stonefish, and cone snail, were delightful. However, most characters were unlikable. While I appreciate that the main character is on the spectrum, her constant scientific explanations felt excessive at times. My biggest concern, though, is her lack of agency; despite earning a PhD, she often seems passive, which conflicts with Nate's view of her as a fighter. This disconnect made it hard to fully engage with her character until the very end of the book.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Author's Writing Style:**  \n  Abbi Waxman's writing is honest, funny, and sarcastic. Her ability to craft relatable characters and bizarre yet believable situations makes her work endlessly enjoyable.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Christa, the protagonist, is a well-developed character. She is one of three sisters with a complex family background, including a famous father who disappeared 25 years ago and was presumed dead. As an adult, Christa has tried to distance herself from her past by studying snails in the Indian Ocean. Her rebellious teenage years and her tendency to speak her mind make her a compelling and relatable character.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The story revolves around Christa's family reuniting after her father, a Steve Irwin-like figure, is discovered alive and ready to reclaim his fame. This reunion leads to chaos, especially when Christa and a childhood friend uncover deeper feelings for each other. The plot is engaging, with a mix of family drama, humor, and romance.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The book is so captivating that I almost started reading it again immediately after finishing it. The emotional depth and humor kept me thoroughly engaged throughout.  \n\n- **Setting and Context:**  \n  The story is set against the backdrop of a unique family dynamic, with Christa's mother having started a Foundation that used Christa's fame as a child to promote its cause. This adds an interesting layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Format and Reading Experience:**  \n  I read the paperback version of the book, which added to the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nChrista Comes Out of Her Shell is another brilliant novel by Abbi Waxman, filled with relatable characters, humor, and emotional depth. The engaging plot and well-crafted writing make it a must-read for fans of Waxman's work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I wasn’t okay with how rushed the story was with the main character’s father. He’s portrayed as a jerk, and his cowardice was off-putting.  \n\n- **Romantic/Intimate Content:**  \n  This book felt a bit more \"open door\" compared to the author’s other works. I’m not a huge fan of this aspect in this particular book.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  There’s a sexual assault scene, which I didn’t expect based on the author’s other writings. I skipped over it before reading too much detail, so I’m not sure how graphic it was.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While this wasn’t my favorite book by the author, I still enjoyed it enough to continue reading her other works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had strong character development and tackled themes of family reconciliation, but the rushed resolution with the father and the unexpected sexual assault scene detracted from my overall enjoyment. Despite this, I remain a fan of the author and look forward to her future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ✨"

Her writing style is one of the reasons I enjoy her books so much. *I Was Told It Would Get Easier* is one of my all-time favorites, and I’m definitely eager to read more of her work.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found myself wanting to connect with the characters, but I just didn’t really care about them. They didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped.\n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The ending is satisfying, but most of the rest of the story felt too silly for my taste. The tone didn’t quite align with what I was expecting or hoping for.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It makes me so sad that I didn’t love this book. I was really looking forward to it, given how much I enjoy the author’s other works, but this one didn’t meet my expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Abbi Waxman’s writing style and have loved her previous books, this particular novel didn’t resonate with me as much as I had hoped. The characters felt underdeveloped, and the plot leaned too heavily on silliness, though the ending was satisfying. Despite this, I remain a fan of the author and look forward to reading more of her work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This sparks family drama as Christa and her two sisters rally around their mother. Meanwhile, reporters investigate the mystery of the father's disappearance and reappearance, while his talent agent seeks to exploit the situation for profit.",
            "*Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* thrives on its vibrant ensemble cast, with much of the humor stemming from the dynamic interactions among its four distinctly different female family members—and a spirited dog. The story also introduces a budding romance, a failed fling, a persistent talent agent, his insightful assistant, a loving personal chef, and a long-lost father. However, Christa's character remains largely unchanged amidst the family chaos, showing little growth by the novel's conclusion.",
            "I appreciated the time I spent with this novel, particularly its exploration of family dynamics. However, it didn't capture my heart enough for a reread. I recommend it to readers of literary fiction who can suspend disbelief and embrace the flow of the story.",
            "I eagerly picked up this book on Libby as soon as it was released, having thoroughly enjoyed the author's previous work, *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*. I was期待ing a relatable female protagonist characterized by quirky, self-deprecating humor and engaging character development. To me, this book leans more towards literary fiction than romance. While Christa does grapple with a romantic interest and navigates an ill-advised past fling, much of the story centers on family drama. Although there are a couple of open-door scenes, an awkward third-act breakup, and a happy ending, the novel could have thrived even without its romantic elements."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author Comparison and Expectations:**  \n   - I picked up this book on Libby as soon as it released because I truly loved the author’s earlier book, *The Bookish Life of Nina Hill*. I was hoping for a similarly relatable female main character with quirky self-deprecating humor and interesting character development.  \n\n- **Characters and Ensemble Cast:**  \n   - *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* relied heavily on its ensemble cast because most of the humor resulted from the interactions between the four radically different female family members—and a spunky dog. Thrown into the mix was a budding love interest, a failed fling, a pushy talent agent, his prescient assistant, an affectionate personal chef, and a formerly missing father.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The plot of the novel was pretty basic: Christa was performing research on an island in the Indian Ocean when her presumed dead, formerly famous father reappears. Family drama ensued as Christa and her two sisters rallied around their mother. Reporters started to dig into the disappearance/reappearance while the father’s talent agent sought to exploit and monetize the situation.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Christa herself demonstrated little character growth throughout the family insanity as she was pretty much the same at the end of the novel.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - Personally, I would consider this more of a literary fiction novel than a romance novel. Christa does reluctantly entertain a romantic interest as she actively avoids an ill-advised past fling. There is an open-door scene or two, an awkward third-act breakup, and even a happily-ever-after ending. But so much of the novel was focused on the family drama that it could have been very successful without the romance.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Overall, I enjoyed the time I spent with this novel because of the family dynamics. However, I did not love this novel so much that I would acquire the book to read again. I recommend this to literary fiction readers who can suspend disbelief and go with the flow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the family dynamics and humor in *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell*, the lack of significant character growth and the overshadowing of romance by family drama made it less impactful than the author’s previous work. It’s a decent read for fans of literary fiction but not one I’d revisit.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It reminded me of Ali Hazelwood’s *The Love Hypothesis* in this regard, though the voice and tone are different.\n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  If you enjoy Ali Hazelwood’s unique FMCs, her incorporation of science, and her stream-of-consciousness writing, you might appreciate this novel. However, the voice here is distinct and not a direct match.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers an engaging mix of science, humor, and a quirky protagonist, but its pacing and stream-of-consciousness style may not appeal to everyone. Fans of Ali Hazelwood’s work might find similarities worth exploring, though the tone and execution are unique.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The novel centers on Christa, a quiet snail researcher living on a small island, whose life is upended by the sudden reappearance of her famous father, Jasper, after 20 years in the Alaskan wilderness.

            "In this story, the romantic subplot between Christa and Nate often feels like an afterthought rather than a central focus. Nevertheless, I appreciated how their relationship provided Christa with an escape from her responsibilities. Their instant connection was easy to identify, even if it occasionally seemed unnecessary. The plot involving a long-lost father reappearing after twenty-five years may stretch the bounds of realism, but I believe great storytelling can transcend such concerns. The family's conflicting emotions—anger and joy at their father's return—were portrayed authentically, reflecting their long-held convictions and enduring love amid difficult times.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Style and Consistency:**  \n   - Ever since I read Abbi Waxman’s *Garden of Small Beginnings*, I have been a huge fan. *Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* captures the same quirky, real-life effervescence that the first novel had.  \n   - Abbi Waxman is a great storyteller, and her ability to create relatable, imperfect characters shines through in this book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Right from the moment Christa is introduced while viewing her sea snails, I fell in love with her. As the story progressed, each moment revealed more about her character.  \n   - Christa wasn’t perfect, but she was perfectly awkward and fun to read about.  \n\n- **Plot and Realism:**  \n   - The story about a long-lost father who appears out of nowhere after twenty-five years was a bit unrealistic, but I’ve never let realism get in the way of great storytelling.  \n   - The family’s conflicting emotions—anger and joy at seeing their father—felt authentic. Their long-held convictions and love for each other, even through difficult times, rang true.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - When it comes to romance, I’m not sure it’s Abbi Waxman’s focus. The romantic angle between Christa and Nate sometimes felt like an add-on.  \n   - However, I appreciated how the romance served as an escape from the press of responsibility for Christa. Her instant connection with Nate was easy to figure out and explore, even if it felt unnecessary at times.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Tone:**  \n   - The story was cute, light, and an escape from reality. It was such an easy and enjoyable read.  \n   - This book is my second favorite of Abbi Waxman’s works, and I’ve liked all of her stories so far.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Christa Comes Out of Her Shell* is a charming and lighthearted novel that captures Abbi Waxman’s signature quirky style. While the plot may stretch realism at times, the relatable characters, authentic family dynamics, and effortless storytelling make it a delightful read. The romance subplot, though not the strongest aspect, adds a layer of escapism to the story. Overall, it’s a fun and engaging book that fans of Waxman’s work will enjoy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

She is taken from her isolated island, where she studies snails, to face her father's reappearance after 25 years. While she is strong and resilient, I found her somewhat unlikable at times.

            "The love story feels flat and unengaging due to a lack of chemistry between the characters. While the premise of Christa’s return to her family following her father's unexpected reappearance and the subsequent media frenzy is intriguing, it ultimately fails to deliver on its potential.",
            "The protagonist, Christa, is a teenage PhD who embodies a confusing mix of prickliness and passivity, displaying both intelligence and naiveté without any captivating nuances. Unfortunately, she comes off as both annoying and dull, lacking the depth necessary to engage readers. In contrast, her mother and sisters stand out as the book's most compelling characters, showcasing greater complexity and depth than Christa herself.",

        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite an interesting premise and strong secondary characters (Christa’s mom and sisters), the novel disappoints due to its unlikable protagonist, lackluster romantic subplot, and a tone that feels more snarky than humorous.
