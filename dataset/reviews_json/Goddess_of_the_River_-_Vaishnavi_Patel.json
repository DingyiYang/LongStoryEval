Through Devavrata (Bhishma), the narrative examines the folly of mortals and their relentless quest for power, shedding light on the complexities of the Kuru lineage and the missteps that have led to its turmoil.

This pivotal transformation triggers a series of events with profound consequences, particularly for Bhishma, the last surviving godling in human form. The narrative explores Bhishma's noble yet frustrating character, emphasizing how his steadfast vows lead to unintended harm and chaos. While the complexity of the story features a multitude of names and intricate family dynamics, the main characters are clearly defined and consistently revisited, making the plot mostly accessible. The sprawling nature of the Mahabharata is retained, and although the sheer number of characters can be overwhelming, Patel's focus on key figures ensures clarity and keeps the reader engaged.",
            "Bhishma is a conflicted character, embodying both nobility and loyalty while causing harm through his strict adherence to his vows. Ganga’s transformation from a detached goddess to a mother navigating human emotions is beautifully depicted. The exploration of motherhood from a goddess's perspective is both poignant and well-executed.",
            "The prose in this novel is commendable, but I found the author's debut, *Kaikeyi*, to be more thoughtful and emotionally resonant. She deserves praise for her skill in reinterpreting the Mahabharata, highlighting lesser-known characters and creating a unique, compelling narrative.",
            "The novel delves into the complex relationship between wishes and actions, highlighted by Karna’s poignant question: “Do a person's wishes matter? Or is it their actions on which they should be judged?” This theme enriches the narrative, prompting readers to contemplate morality and the basis of judgment."

Anybody who has read the epic knows that she is featured prominently at the beginning and then fades promptly into the background.  \n- **Narrative and Adaptation:**  \n  While reading, I was a little irked at all the fantastical changes added to the story to bring her into prominence throughout. However, on reflection, this book was a good journey. Ganga's story was beautifully melded into the epic and tied to the characters' actions, while also exploring the divinity of the gods involved in the story.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I am always slightly uncomfortable when modern prose is added to retellings of old myths and epics, so I had to stomach some of that.  \n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  A core part of Mahabharata is the complex morality of decisions and the problems that arise from them. As the retellings always do, the book ends with a discussion on dharma, righteousness, and fate. This is definitely one of those books that finishes strong.  \n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  Mahabharata is one of the first epics that I have read, and I will always have a soft spot for its retellings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book offers a unique and imaginative retelling of the Mahabharata, with River Ganga as the protagonist.

The ending was impactful, and I appreciated learning about a new mythological tale.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The reader really feels the weight of duty and responsibility, as well as the internal conflict when it comes to keeping vows versus moral goodness. Throughout the book, characters are faced with difficult decisions that put them at war (both figuratively and literally) with themselves and with others. As they reflect on past decisions, they also must face the consequences of those choices. Even deified characters are not exempt from this push and pull, and there are so many shades of gray as more and more choices lead to a war that feels almost inevitable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Character Development:**  \n  I love Patel’s writing style and how she weaves new threads of stories into existing canonic cultural tapestries, telling the tales from perspectives that are missing from the originals. The characters are incredibly flawed, and yet I couldn’t help but relate to many of them in different ways. I felt one’s helplessness over not knowing how to fix a situation as it gets progressively more complicated, as well as another’s internal battle to do what is right while also upholding honor and dignity. I didn’t necessarily agree with the choices they made, but I could understand why they made them.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Content Warnings:**  \n  I definitely recommend this book, but also suggest readers check the content warnings, as there are several.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a compelling and thought-provoking retelling of Ganga’s story, blending mythological depth with themes of duty, moral conflict, and the consequences of choices.

Ganga, a character who has only a brief presence in the original epic, is developed with imaginative touches and depth. These enhancements breathe life into a character often overlooked. While the initial chapters, depicting Ganga as a god unfamiliar with humanity, can be difficult to engage with, the storytelling improves significantly, resulting in a smoother reading experience.",
            "The portrayal of Bhishma’s transformation from a mama’s boy to a mature man was beautifully executed. His perspective on the war added significant depth to his character. Ganga’s reflections on humanity, her place in the universe, and her struggle with change were poignantly written, though undeniably heartbreaking as she distanced herself from her original self.",

While some readers may appreciate this approach, I personally prefer the straightforward prose of the Ramayana, as demonstrated in the author’s previous novel, *Kaikeyi*. Nonetheless, I recognize the challenge of maintaining this style and acknowledge its importance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Retelling and Adaptation:**  \n  Retelling a story from the Mahabharata is an immense challenge, but Patel handles it with grace and sets a clear direction for the novel. Ganga, a character who only appears briefly in the original epic, is fully fleshed out with added liberties and fantastical elements. These additions were well-executed and brought life to a character who often doesn’t receive much attention.  \n\n- **Themes and Ambiguity:**  \n  Patel maintains the ethical ambiguity that is central to the Mahabharata, which I appreciated. The story avoids being straightforward, preserving the complexity of the original. This was a relief, as I was concerned this aspect might be lost in the retelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Bhishma’s transformation from a mama’s boy to the man he becomes was beautifully portrayed. I also appreciated getting his perspective on the war, which added depth to his character. Ganga’s viewpoint on humankind, her role in the universe, and her navigation of shifting elements were incredibly well-written but heartbreaking as she drifted further from her original self.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Language:**  \n  Patel retains the heavy, flowery language and narrative structure of the original Mahabharata, which I found less appealing. While some readers may enjoy this style, I personally prefer the more straightforward prose of the Ramayana, as seen in Patel’s previous novel, *Kaikeyi*. However, I respect the difficulty of maintaining this style and acknowledge its significance.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The first few chapters, where Ganga is a god unfamiliar with humankind, were challenging to get through. However, the storytelling evens out afterward, making it an easier read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, Patel’s retelling of Ganga’s story is a commendable effort that captures the essence of the Mahabharata while adding depth to a lesser-explored character. Despite my reservations about the narrative style, the novel’s themes, character development, and adaptation of the original epic make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars, rounded up for Goodreads."

            "The story unfolds through two perspectives: Ganga and her son, Bhishma. I found Ganga’s chapters particularly engaging, as her thoughts and experiences are vividly portrayed. Her exploration of humanity, motherhood, and emotions is especially compelling. In contrast, Bhishma’s chapters initially felt overwhelming due to the multitude of names and family connections, making them harder to navigate. However, my appreciation for his narrative grew as the book progressed.",
            "Many readers have lauded the writing, and I concur that the story becomes more accessible after the 30% mark. However, I find it difficult to fully appreciate the prose's beauty. I'm uncertain whether my experience stemmed from a personal disconnect or simply not being in the right mindset, unlike others who enjoyed it.",
            "I approached this book with no prior knowledge of Hindu mythology. While I found the story engaging, I realized that some background information would have enhanced my understanding of key plot points and family relationships. The included family tree did not fully clarify my confusion.",
            "This isn't a genre I typically explore, and if it hadn't been an Illumicrate monthly pick, I likely wouldn't have chosen it. While I'm not the book's intended audience and don't foresee delving further into this type of literature, I unexpectedly found myself enjoying it more than anticipated."

        "conclusion": "This book was an unexpected but enjoyable read for me, despite not being my usual genre. While I struggled with some aspects, such as the complexity of family relationships and initial confusion, I found Ganga’s perspective particularly engaging. The writing improved as the story progressed, and I’m glad I didn’t give up on it. I recommend it to those interested in mythology and exploring new narrative styles.",

I’m not the intended audience for such a book, and I don’t see myself venturing more into this type of literature. However, I surprisingly enjoyed it more than I expected.\n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Context:**  \n  I went into this book completely blind regarding Hindu mythology. While I found the story interesting, I can see how some prior research or familiarity with the mythology could have helped me better understand certain plot points and family relationships. The provided family tree wasn’t entirely sufficient to clear up my confusion.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspectives:**  \n  The story is told from two perspectives: Ganga and her son Bhishma. I really enjoyed Ganga’s chapters, as her thoughts and experiences were more clearly depicted. Her exploration of humanity, motherhood, and human emotions was particularly compelling. On the other hand, Bhishma’s chapters were initially overwhelming with names and family relations, which made them harder to follow. However, I started to appreciate his chapters more towards the end of the book.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Many people praised the writing, and I agree that after the 30% mark, the book became easier to read. However, I can’t fully comment on the beauty of the prose, as I’m not sure if it was a personal disconnect or if I just wasn’t in the right mindset to appreciate it as others did.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Despite my initial struggles and contemplation of DNFing (Did Not Finish), I’m glad I stuck with it. While this isn’t my usual genre, I do recommend giving this book a try, especially for those interested in mythology and unique storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an unexpected but enjoyable read for me, despite not being my usual genre. While I struggled with some aspects, such as the complexity of family relationships and initial confusion, I found Ganga’s perspective particularly engaging. The writing improved as the story progressed, and I’m glad I didn’t give up on it. I recommend it to those interested in mythology and exploring new narrative styles.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

The contrasting narratives of Ganga and Bhishma are skillfully crafted, enhancing the overall appeal of both storylines.",
            "Patel's talent for creating retellings that are both profoundly human and grand in scope is impressive. Her writing is exceptional, and I particularly appreciated how Ganga's story was portrayed. While I have some minor critiques—such as the war itself deserving more focus—I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.",
            "In *Goddess of the River*, Patel masterfully delves into themes of humanity, duty, honor, and familial bonds. I appreciated the emphasis on love beyond the romantic, and the tension between fulfilling one's duty and acting morally was particularly compelling. The narrative revolves around the events leading to the Mahabharata's war of succession, focusing on Ganga and her son Bhishma. Although the war itself is not extensively depicted, the author skillfully builds an atmosphere of impending conflict throughout the novel."

The focus on forms of love outside of romantic love was refreshing, and I found the tension between doing one’s duty and doing what is morally right to be particularly interesting. The novel centers on the events leading up to the war of succession from the Mahabharata, with Ganga and her son Bhishma at the heart of the story. While the actual war doesn’t get much screen time, Patel effectively creates an atmosphere of impending conflict throughout the novel.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The mother/son relationship between Ganga and Bhishma takes center stage, but I also appreciated how well-fleshed-out the other characters and their relationships were, especially Karna and Krishna. The differences between Ganga’s and Bhishma’s narrations were well-executed, and both storylines were compelling.\n\n- **Writing Style and Retelling Approach:**  \n  Patel’s ability to write retellings that are both deeply human and grand in scale is impressive. Her writing is wonderful, and I thought the way Ganga’s story was handled was particularly well done. While there are minor critiques (e.g., the war itself could have been given more space), I had a great time reading this novel.\n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  As much as I loved *Kaikeyi*, I think *Goddess of the River* is a step up from Patel’s debut. Her growth as a writer is evident, and this novel solidified my admiration for her storytelling.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I absolutely loved *Goddess of the River*.

Her previous work, *Kaikeyi*, was one of my favorite books, and *Goddess of the River* matches its excellence.  \n\n- **Retelling of Mythology:**  \n  Patel retells a story from Indian myths, specifically the Mahabharata, focusing on Ganga, the titular goddess of the river, and her doomed son. Despite the challenge of writing about a character who is, for most of the time, an actual river, Patel does so wonderfully.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I adore Ganga as a character—she is both otherworldly and deeply relatable. The story later shifts to her son, Devavrata, whose plot involves many characters. Initially, I was confused about who was who, but it all made sense quickly. Devavrata is a wonderful character, though frustrating at times, which is integral to his story.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  I appreciated the absence of clear black-and-white morality in most of the characters. They aren’t entirely likeable, but they all have likeable aspects, making them fascinating to read about.  \n\n- **Writing and Themes:**  \n  Patel’s writing is stellar, and the themes are on point. Motherhood is a central theme, explored uniquely through the lens of a goddess mother and her mortal son. Morality, duty, karma, and dharma are also central to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  I was completely absorbed in this retelling from the very first page. It’s an incredibly well-crafted novel and a reading experience I won’t forget.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a masterful retelling of Indian mythology, showcasing Vaishnavi Patel’s exceptional storytelling skills. With its complex characters, rich themes, and stellar writing, it’s a novel that leaves a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars, easily rounding up.  \n\nMany thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK and Netgalley for the ARC!

It’s indulgent and captivating, making this one of the best-written books I’ve ever read. The first-person perspective and time-jumping elements are executed flawlessly, creating a complete and immersive story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are deeply compelling, especially Ganga and her son Bhisma. Ganga’s transformation from the Goddess of the River to a mortal, mother, and ultimately a figure grappling with tragedy is heart-wrenching. Bhisma’s evolution from a momma’s boy to a vow-driven man torn between right and wrong is equally moving. Every character feels richly developed and emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Plot and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story is packed with moving and heartbreaking moments that tug at your heartstrings. Empires fall, families are torn apart, and the emotional stakes are incredibly high. Be prepared to have your emotions “hulk-smashed.” The plot is driven by character development, making every twist and turn feel impactful.\n\n- **Immersion and Investment:**  \n  The storytelling is so immersive that I felt deeply invested in every aspect of the world. I wanted to know everything about every character, every god, and even every tree. Patel’s ability to create such a sense of investment is remarkable.\n\n- **Originality and Adaptation:**  \n  While I’m not familiar with the original tale, Patel’s adaptation feels fresh and engaging. The story drew me in completely, and I didn’t feel lost despite the time-jumping narrative structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKaikeyi is an absolute masterpiece of storytelling, with poetic writing, deeply moving characters, and a plot that will leave you emotionally shattered in the best way. Patel’s ability to craft such an immersive and heart-wrenching story is unparalleled. This book has made Patel an auto-buy author for me, and I can’t recommend it enough.

            "This novel retells the story of Ganga from the Mahabharata, presenting her experiences through a first-person perspective. The narrative shifts between timelines and characters, exploring Ganga's early life, the curse she bears, her relationship with Shantanu, and the birth and loss of their children, all while delving into the political tensions in Hastinapur following Shantanu's death. \n\nThough the story is rich and layered, the frequent time and perspective shifts, combined with the multitude of characters and plotlines, can make it challenging to follow and detracts from the central focus. The pacing is uneven due to the inclusion of numerous characters, factions, and political backstories. While Ganga's journey is compelling, the overwhelming number of additional elements muddles the narrative, making it difficult to remain fully engaged.",
            "Ganga is a richly complex protagonist, and her emotional moments—especially her struggles as a mother—stand out as the strongest aspects of the novel. Bhishma's internal conflict between his royal duties and his moral beliefs adds further depth to the story. However, the inclusion of numerous side characters often feels superfluous, hindering the pacing and detracting from engagement with the central narrative.",

The narrative alternates between perspectives and timelines, covering Ganga's relationship with Shantanu, the birth and loss of their children, and the political tensions in Hastinapur after Shantanu's death. While the story is rich and layered, the frequent time and perspective skips, along with the multitude of characters and plotlines, made it challenging to follow and detracted from the main focus.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga is a complex and multi-layered protagonist, and her emotional passages, particularly those depicting her struggles as a mother, were the strongest parts of the novel. Bhishma's internal conflict between his duties to the kingdom and his moral compass also added depth to the story. However, many side characters felt unnecessary and slowed the pacing, making it harder to stay engaged with the central narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel's prose is poignant and lyrical, contributing to the novel's beauty and emotional impact.

While I didn’t love this the way I loved *Kaikeyi*, I did really enjoy it. I honestly think a different author would have made the book much more unapproachable.  \n\n- **Complexity of Characters and Family Tree:**  \n  This book definitely had A LOT of characters, and the family tree was difficult to follow. However, that’s just the way the story goes—it’s a retelling. I highly recommend pulling up the family tree to reference while reading. It really helped me and made the story more fun and interactive.  \n\n- **Philosophical Depth and Themes:**  \n  This book is highly philosophical, and my thoughts and opinions felt like they changed every chapter. There are many discussions on duty, loyalty, dharma, sacrifice, and honor. The characters all had good and bad qualities, and I felt like I never knew who to root for.  \n\n- **Engagement and Impact:**  \n  The book definitely keeps you hooked, and I came away from it feeling more educated and empathetic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  I gave it four stars because I felt like the pacing, flashbacks, and different POVs were a bit overcomplicated and hard to follow.  \n\n- **Recommendations and Trigger Warnings:**  \n  I do highly recommend checking the trigger warnings the author includes at the beginning of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a really fun time with this book and am excited to read more by this author. While the complexity of the story and characters made it challenging at times, it was an engaging and thought-provoking read that left a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Cultural Significance and Learning Experience:**  \n  I am not particularly familiar with the Indian epic the Mahabharata, but reading this book sparked fascinating conversations that led me to learn more about its importance in Indian culture. This aspect alone made the book incredibly valuable to me.  \n\n- **Uniqueness and Appeal:**  \n  While some might dismiss this as just another mythology retelling, it is far from a typical Greek retelling. The story’s focus on the river Ganga (or the Ganges) and her fantastical saga sets it apart and makes it worth exploring.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The first half of the book, which delves into Ganga’s origins and her initial journey, was my favorite part. It was captivating and magical. The second half shifted to a more political war narrative, which was still good but lacked the same enchanting quality as the beginning.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Recommendation:**  \n  If you have any interest in world mythologies, I believe this is a must-read. It offers a fresh perspective and a deep dive into a culturally rich story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a unique and engaging retelling of a culturally significant epic, blending fantastical elements with a rich narrative. While the second half didn’t quite match the magic of the first, it remains a worthwhile read for anyone interested in mythology.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Hachette for sending me a copy for review."

The writing style felt like I was being told the story by Ganga herself, which added a poetic flair to the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga’s journey from the heavens to earth was compelling. I felt her suffering, rage, and the weight of the choices she had to make as a mother. By the end, I truly understood her. While Ganga was my favorite, the other characters were just as complex and interesting, and I didn’t find it overwhelming to keep track of them.  \n\n- **World-Building and Mythology:**  \n  As my first introduction to Hindu mythology, I cannot speak to the accuracy of the retelling, but the world felt rich and immersive. The story’s exploration of myths and lessons was fascinating and left me eager to learn more.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Patel’s prose was beautiful and added a poetic touch to the story without overshadowing the narrative. The writing style made the story feel intimate, as if Ganga herself was recounting her tale.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  There was some slight confusion with a certain character, which I’ve seen others mention as well. However, I personally liked this twist because Ganga shared the confusion with the reader, making it feel intentional and effective.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The book includes trigger warnings for certain parts of the story, which Patel thoughtfully provides in the first few pages.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was absolutely phenomenal, from the story and world-building to the characters and writing style.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Mythical Retelling and Fresh Perspective:**  \n  I really enjoy mythical retellings, especially when a new twist is put on them to tell the story from a fresh perspective. *Goddess of the River* is a reimagined take on Ganga’s story from *The Mahabharata*, and it was clear that significant research concerning geological features also went into the writing of the book.  \n\n- **Themes of Duty, Responsibility, and Moral Conflict:**  \n  I really enjoyed the push and pull in this book. The reader really feels the weight of duty and responsibility, as well as the internal conflict when it comes to keeping vows versus moral goodness. Throughout the book, characters are faced with difficult decisions that put them at war (both figuratively and literally) with themselves and with others. As they reflect on past decisions, they also must face the consequences of those choices. Even deified characters are not exempt from this push and pull, and there are so many shades of gray as more and more choices lead to a war that feels almost inevitable.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Character Development:**  \n  I love Patel’s writing style and how she weaves new threads of stories into existing canonic cultural tapestries, telling the tales from perspectives that are missing from the originals. The characters are incredibly flawed, and yet I couldn’t help but relate to many of them in different ways. I felt one’s helplessness over not knowing how to fix a situation as it gets progressively more complicated, as well as another’s internal battle to do what is right while also upholding honor and dignity. I didn’t necessarily agree with the choices they made, but I could understand why they made them.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Content Warnings:**  \n  I definitely recommend this book, but also suggest readers check the content warnings, as there are several.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a compelling and thought-provoking retelling of Ganga’s story, blending mythical elements with deep moral and emotional conflicts. Patel’s writing style and character development shine, making the flawed characters relatable and their struggles palpable. While the book explores heavy themes and difficult choices, it offers a fresh perspective on a classic tale.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5  \n\nThank you to Redhook Books for the advanced edition!"

I find feminist retellings of religious texts more engaging than annotated versions of the original texts.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Structure:**  \n  The novel is retold from the perspectives of the goddess Ganga and her mortal son, Bhisma. Patel creatively uses the river as a Pensieve-like device to reveal unfamiliar characters' thoughts and fill in missing plot points. However, the alternating narrators sometimes felt choppy and lacked cohesion.\n\n- **Themes and Character Portrayal:**  \n  Patel questions the hypocrisy surrounding righteousness and societal hierarchies. All characters, both mortal and immortal, are portrayed as flawed, challenging the notion of absolute goodness. The book explores whether choices can have universally beneficial consequences or at least avoid harm.\n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The personification of the river in the earlier chapters was beautifully written, showcasing Patel's skill in crafting vivid imagery.\n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  Compared to Patel's debut, \"Kaikeyi,\" this novel lacks the bolder lines and overtly feminist elements that made \"Kaikeyi\" stand out. I wonder if Patel tempered her approach due to the harsh right-wing criticism of her first book.\n\n- **Challenges of Retelling the Mahabharatham:**  \n  The Mahabharatham's complexity, with its numerous plot points and characters, makes it difficult to introduce fresh or creative elements, especially for readers familiar with the original story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nVaishnavi Patel's \"Goddess of the River\" is a thoughtful and beautifully written retelling of the Mahabharatham, exploring themes of motherhood, sacrifice, and societal hypocrisy. While it excels in its vivid imagery and creative narrative devices, it falls short in cohesion between narrators and lacks the bold feminist elements of Patel's previous work.

Her willingness to protect herself and those she loved resonated deeply with me. However, while I appreciated her character, I wanted more depth in her relationship with her son, Devavrata. It often felt driven by obligation rather than emotional complexity.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The author’s writing style is beautiful and prose-like, which I admired. However, some parts felt overly detailed, leaving me glassy-eyed and struggling to stay fully engaged.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The story’s focus on motherhood and Ganga’s love for her son is timeless and classic. I believe mothers who read this will take away far more than I could, as the narrative delves deeply into these themes.  \n\n- **Expectations and Preparation:**  \n  While I love going into books blind, I was unprepared for the depth of storytelling in this novel. Approaching it with a Tolkien-like perspective—ready for intricate world-building and detailed lore—would likely enhance the reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Goddess of the River* is a beautifully written retelling rooted in Hindu mythology, exploring profound themes of life, death, and motherhood. While I appreciated its depth and Ganga’s character, I wanted more emotional complexity in her relationship with her son. The detailed storytelling, though admirable, occasionally felt overwhelming.

            "The author skillfully employs the River Ganga as both the narrator and main character, creating a unique and compelling perspective. Ganga’s ability to recall memories as her waters flow over lesser-known characters offers profound insights into their histories and mindsets. The story mimics the river itself: it begins with a fast pace to establish the trajectory, meanders slowly in the middle, and culminates in a dramatic, waterfall-like conclusion.",

            "In contrast to *Kaikeyi*, where the protagonist is deeply involved in the intrigues of the Ramayana, Ganga remains largely passive and detached from the mortal realm. Aside from giving birth to Bhishma, she primarily serves as an observer and occasional advisor to her son. The narrative perspective shifts between Ganga and Bhishma, but I found Bhishma's viewpoint particularly insufferable.",
            "I was disappointed that the story overlooked more intriguing characters from the Mahabharata, such as Krishna, Shikhandi, and Arjuna’s wives (excluding Draupadi). Their narratives could have offered valuable queer and female perspectives that were marginalized by the patriarchal caste system in the original epic.",
            "The novel effectively underscores the Mahabharata’s themes of the perils of inaction and the destructive nature of duty and justice. The war's inevitable decline illustrates the futility of personal ideals, revealing that there are no true winners or heroes, not even among the gods. Ganga’s realization of her freedom from mortal concerns, while still connected to their world, ultimately feels unfulfilling.",
            "I was truly impressed by the author's debut novel *Kaikeyi*, a remarkable reclamation of an epic narrative centered on a character often criticized for her agency. It brought to mind Madeline Miller's *Circe*. I was particularly eager to see how the author would portray Goddess Ganga, whose brief time as a mortal queen leaves a significant mark in the Mahabharata.",
            "As a longtime reader of the Mahabharata, I felt that this retelling did not offer the same level of subversive insight as *Kaikeyi*. While it presents a valuable perspective for those new to the epic, it ultimately fell short of delivering the fresh interpretations I had anticipated."

It reminded me of *Circe* by Madeline Miller. I was excited to see how the author would handle the voice of Goddess Ganga, whose brief stint as a mortal queen was impactful in the Mahabharata.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Character Agency:**  \n  Unlike *Kaikeyi*, where the protagonist actively participated in the machinations of the Ramayana, Ganga remains passive and indifferent to the mortal world. Beyond birthing Bhishma, she is mostly an observer and occasional counsel for her son. The POV also shifts between Ganga and Bhishma, whose perspective I found insufferable.\n\n- **Character Choices and Missed Opportunities:**  \n  I was disappointed that the story didn’t focus on more fascinating characters from the Mahabharata, such as Krishna, Shikhandi, or Arjuna’s wives (excluding Draupadi). Their stories could have provided more vindicating queer and female voices, which were co-opted by the patriarchal caste system in the original epic.\n\n- **Themes and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The novel reinforces the Mahabharata’s themes of the follies of inaction and the toxic ideals of duty and justice. The war’s inevitable nosedive highlights the pointlessness of personal ideals, with no clear winners or good guys, including the gods. Ganga’s epiphany about her freedom from mortal follies, while tethering herself to their world, felt unsatisfying.\n\n- **Subversiveness and Originality:**  \n  As someone deeply familiar with the Mahabharata, I found this retelling didn’t break much new subversive ground compared to *Kaikeyi*. While it offers a great perspective for those unfamiliar with the epic, it didn’t provide the same level of fresh insight or subversion I had hoped for.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel provides an interesting perspective on the Mahabharata, especially for readers unfamiliar with its themes of moral ambiguity and the flaws of a patriarchal caste system.

            "*The Goddess of the River* offers a unique perspective by centering on Bhishma and Ganga, asserting that their story is the foundation of the epic. Initially, I found it challenging to engage with this tone, but the early chapters, which depict Ganga as a mortal and her poignant experiences with her children, were beautifully crafted. The evolution of Bhishma—from a dreamer yearning for his mother's presence to a character defined by his father's influence and unwavering devotion to dharma—was skillfully depicted. The interplay of perspectives between Ganga and Bhishma, coupled with the timeline connections to the impending war, enriched their intricate relationship.",
            "Ganga’s story profoundly moved me, evoking a strong sense of frustration towards Bhishma, which highlights the narrative's emotional depth. The imagery, particularly in the scene where a young Bhishma encounters Ganga, was both captivating and heartwarming."

Its morally grey characters and complex themes make it deeply relatable, despite the distant world of gods, powers, and kingdoms.  \n\n- **Character Focus and Interpretation:**  \n  *The Goddess of the River* takes an unusual approach by focusing on Bhishma and Ganga, arguing that their story is where it all began. While it took me some time to get invested in this particular tone, the initial chapters depicting Ganga as a mortal and her children were heart-wrenching and beautifully written.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The gradual transformation of Bhishma—from a dreamer longing to be with his mother to someone shaped by his father’s influence and extreme loyalty to dharma—was masterfully portrayed. The shifting perspectives between Ganga and Bhishma, along with the timeline connections to the war, added depth to their complex relationship.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  I was deeply moved by Ganga’s story and felt immense frustration with Bhishma, which speaks to the emotional power of the narrative. The imagery, especially in the scene where a young Bhishma meets Ganga, was wholesome and enthralling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Initial Disconnect:**  \n  The first couple of chapters felt disconnected for me, which is why I deducted half a star. However, the story quickly grew into a poignant, beautiful, and clever retelling.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I am eagerly looking forward to all of Vaishnavi Patel’s future releases, as this retelling has left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Goddess of the River* is a poignant, beautiful, and clever retelling of the Mahabharata, focusing on the underrated yet complex characters of Bhishma and Ganga. While it took some time to fully engage me, the emotional depth, character development, and vivid imagery ultimately made it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded down to 4 on Goodreads)."

I loved to read books about the gods and goddesses, Vishnu's avatars, and the history of Hinduism.  \n- **Unique Perspective:**  \n  This novel offered a slightly different take on the Mahabharata, told from the perspective of Ganga, who is not usually a prominent character in the stories. It was nice to envision her thoughts and opinions.  \n- **Divergence from Traditional Narratives:**  \n  There were several instances where this story was very different from what I had known. However, the Mahabharata itself is so vast, with so many characters and stories, that consolidating all of it would be a feat.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  I found the first half of the novel to move much faster than the last half.

The relentless emphasis on men's foolishness became tiresome. Ganga, despite being a goddess, is depicted as weak and powerless. She is outmatched by Shiva, a human sorcerer, and even a mortal king, despite regaining her divine abilities. Her most significant display of power consists of pleading with Shiva to fulfill a human's wish, which is disappointing for a goddess of the river.",

I felt like I was listening to a story rather than being immersed in it.\n\n- **Character Portrayal (Male Characters):**  \n  All the male characters were annoying, including Shiva and Ganga’s naive son. The repeated focus on the folly of men became tiring and frustrating to read.\n\n- **Character Portrayal (Ganga):**  \n  Ganga, a goddess, was portrayed as weak and powerless. She was bested by Shiva, a human sorcerer, and even a human king, even after regaining her goddess powers. Her most significant act of power was having conversations and begging Shiva to grant a human’s wish, which was disappointing for the goddess of the river.\n\n- **Pacing and Interest:**  \n  I spent much of the book feeling bored, as the story failed to hold my interest.\n\n- **Positive Aspect (Amba):**  \n  I liked Amba’s character and appreciated how Ganga treated her. This was a highlight in an otherwise disappointing read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I was initially excited to read a fantasy novel featuring Hindu gods, this book fell short for me. The detached storytelling, frustrating portrayal of male characters, and weak depiction of Ganga left me disconnected and disappointed. Despite enjoying Amba’s character, the overall experience was underwhelming and boring.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 stars"

            "This novel serves as a sequel to the author's previous work, *Kaikeyi*, and revisits a tale from Hindu mythology, this time centering on the goddess Ganga from the *Mahabharata*. I approached the book as a standalone narrative, having no prior knowledge of Hindu mythology. While the endnotes outline the modifications to the original story, I chose not to explore those details. The narrative is somber and intense, delving into the dynastic conflicts of Hastinapura and Bhishma’s challenge to uphold peace while remaining loyal to the Kauravas.",
            "In this story, Ganga, the titular character, initially stands as a detached observer, scornful of humanity’s destructive nature. However, her perspective shifts dramatically when she is cursed to experience mortal life, leading her to develop a deeper empathy for human struggles. Central to the narrative is Ganga’s love for her son, Bhishma, a man of strong morals ensnared in a dynastic conflict due to an oath taken in his youth. The story skillfully alternates between the viewpoints of Ganga and Bhishma, especially in its latter half, enriching the narrative and deepening their emotional journeys.",
            "Ganga serves primarily as a supportive figure, providing love and comfort to Bhishma as he wrestles with despair and moral dilemmas. The inclusion of deities such as Shiva and Krishna enriches the narrative, with Krishna playing a more active role in the unfolding events.",
            "One particularly challenging moment in the story occurs when Ganga drowns her first seven newborn sons to liberate them from a curse. This emotionally intense scene, though brief, leaves a lasting impact. Overall, the book is compelling and well-written, anchored by a strong emotional core."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is an excellent book that skillfully retells a mythological story with rich characterization and emotional depth.

Patel’s endnotes discuss her changes to the source material, but I didn’t delve into those details.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  - Ganga, the title character, begins as a passive observer of humanity, disdainful of humans’ destructive tendencies. However, her perspective evolves as she is cursed to live as a mortal and becomes more empathetic toward humanity.  \n  - Ganga’s love for her son, Bhishma, is a central theme. Bhishma is portrayed as a morally upright man caught in a dynastic struggle due to an oath he swore in his youth.  \n  - The narrative alternates between Ganga’s and Bhishma’s perspectives, particularly in the latter part of the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story is bleak and depressing, focusing on the dynastic strife in Hastinapura and Bhishma’s struggle to maintain peace while bound by his oath to the Kauravas.  \n  - Ganga’s role is largely supportive, offering love and comfort to Bhishma as he grapples with despair and moral dilemmas.  \n  - The involvement of deities like Shiva and Krishna adds depth to the narrative, with Krishna playing a more direct role in events.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Challenges:**  \n  - One particularly challenging moment involves Ganga drowning her first seven newborn sons to free them from a curse.

            "In this story, Ganga begins as an indifferent goddess but gradually discovers her humanity through her love for her children, especially Devavrata. Their relationship is profoundly touching, and Ganga's anguish at leaving him is deeply felt. Devavrata, also known as Bhishma, is a complex character burdened by his past choices and the heavy demands of dharma and karma. His backstory unfolds through Ganga’s perspective, while his adult life and the events leading to the war are portrayed from his own viewpoint.",
            "The narrative shifts between Ganga’s and Devavrata/Bhishma’s perspectives, creating an initially jarring experience that gradually gains fluidity. The writing powerfully conveys the emotional depth of the characters’ relationships and struggles. However, the ending feels rushed; a final reunion scene between Bhishma, his siblings, and Ganga would have offered a more satisfying conclusion.",
            "This poignant retelling of the Mahabharata centers on the goddess Ganga's journey to humanity through her love for her son, Devavrata, who later becomes Bhishma. The novel emphasizes the emotional depth of the epic, illustrating the heartache and self-destructive tendencies of humanity. It delves into themes of maternal love, the intricacies of dharma and karma, and the transformative nature of human connection.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which offers a poignant exploration of maternal love and the consequences of choices. It reignited my interest in Hindu retellings, and I eagerly anticipate more works from the author. Although the ending felt a bit rushed, the story is still compelling and beautifully crafted."

Patel’s retelling of the Mahabharata focuses on the emotional core of the epic, portraying it as a story of heartache and the destruction humanity can inflict on itself. The novel explores themes of motherly love, the complexities of dharma and karma, and the transformative power of human connection.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ganga is depicted as a goddess who starts off apathetic toward humans but gradually develops humanity through her love for her children, particularly Devavrata. Her relationship with Devavrata is deeply moving, and her devastation at leaving him is palpable. Devavrata/Bhishma is a tormented character, shaped by his past decisions and the weight of dharma and karma. His backstory is revealed through Ganga’s perspective, while his adult life and the lead-up to the war are shown through his own eyes.\n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The narrative alternates between Ganga’s and Devavrata/Bhishma’s perspectives, which initially feels odd but eventually flows naturally. The writing is emotionally resonant, capturing the depth of the characters’ relationships and struggles. However, the ending feels somewhat rushed, and a final reunion scene between Bhishma, his siblings, and Ganga could have provided a more satisfying conclusion.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Retellings:**  \n  This is the second Mahabharata-inspired book I’ve read this year, the first being *Sons of Darkness* by Gourav Mohanty. While Mohanty’s work focuses on the strategic and plotting aspects of the epic, Patel’s *Goddess of the River* emphasizes its emotional and human elements. Both approaches offer unique and fascinating perspectives on the Mahabharata.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be a poignant exploration of motherly love and the consequences of one’s decisions. It reignited my interest in Hindu retellings, and I look forward to more works from Patel. Despite the slightly rushed ending, it’s a compelling and beautifully crafted story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a heartfelt and emotionally rich retelling of the Mahabharata, focusing on the bond between Ganga and her son, Devavrata/Bhishma. While the ending could have been more rounded, the novel’s exploration of love, humanity, and the weight of dharma makes it a memorable read.

This thoughtful inclusion sets the tone for the reader.  \n\n- **Familiarity with Source Material:**  \n  This is a retelling of the Mahabharata, and I feel I would have benefited from prior knowledge of the original epic. Not being familiar with the Mahabharata left me feeling like I missed out on deeper layers of the story, especially since this version offers a feminist perspective and focuses on a character, Ganga, who likely plays a smaller role in the original.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga, the protagonist, undergoes significant character growth. As a goddess initially detached from human emotions, her transformation into a mortal allows her to experience marriage, motherhood, love, loss, and the weight of destiny. Her choices have far-reaching consequences, culminating in a war, which adds depth to her journey.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Exploration:**  \n  The story delves deeply into the morality of decisions and their long-term consequences.

However, as someone new to the Mahabharata, I found the sprawling epic occasionally confusing. While the story is accessible, having some background knowledge would enhance the reading experience.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  While I enjoyed this book, I still prefer Patel’s debut, *Kaikeyi*, over this retelling. Both showcase her talent for emotional storytelling, but *Kaikeyi* resonated with me more.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  This book is ideal for readers who enjoy historical fantasy, Indian mythology retellings, and emotional epics centered on character growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis retelling of the Mahabharata offers a fresh, feminist perspective through the eyes of Ganga, a character who undergoes profound growth and faces the weight of her choices. While Patel’s writing is beautiful and emotionally engaging, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the Mahabharata beforehand to fully appreciate the story. Despite some confusion due to my lack of prior knowledge, I found the book compelling and thought-provoking, though I still prefer *Kaikeyi*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book offers a rich tapestry of complexity and moral ambiguity, which I truly appreciate. While it took unexpected directions, I found those paths enjoyable. Although I'm not familiar with the source material, the story was fresh and engaging, prompting thoughtful reflection. This is not a fast or easy read; some sections felt drawn out, yet I believe they contributed meaningfully to character development. The pacing in the middle portion slowed down, diminishing my motivation, but overall, I still valued the experience.",
            "Ganga is a captivating character, and her journey in the novel is beautifully depicted. I appreciated her development and how her character was woven into the narrative. Bhishma's perspective provided a compelling contrast to Ganga's, allowing for an exploration of their differing thoughts and the ripple effects of one character's actions on another. However, I found it challenging to keep track of some characters, particularly in the second part of the story, where many new characters were introduced. The use of multiple names for some characters added to the confusion. In hindsight, taking notes would have been helpful, but it also gives me a reason to look forward to a reread.",

I appreciate how she handles complex themes and difficult perspectives with skill.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga is a fascinating character, and her journey throughout the novel was beautiful. I loved her development and how her character was utilized. Bhishma's perspective contrasted nicely with Ganga's, and I enjoyed seeing their differing thoughts and how one character's actions in one POV impacted others in a different POV.  \n\n- **Plot Complexity and Moral Ambiguity:**  \n  The book has a lot of complexity and moral ambiguity, which I really love. It didn’t take the direction I expected, but I enjoyed where things went. The story was new to me, so I can’t compare it to the source material, but I found it engaging and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  This wasn’t a fast or easy read. There were moments that dragged, but I felt they served a narrative purpose and furthered the development of the main characters. The middle portion was slow, and I wasn’t as motivated during that section, but I still enjoyed the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Tracking and Clarity:**  \n  I struggled to keep track of some characters, especially in the second part where a lot of new characters were introduced. Some characters having more than one name added to the confusion. I realized I probably should have taken notes, but this gives me something to look forward to in a reread.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author’s Potential:**  \n  Overall, I really liked this book. Vaishnavi Patel is a strong author, and I will definitely be checking out her future works. I plan to buy a hard copy of this book as well.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and challenges in keeping track of characters, *Goddess of the River* is a beautifully written and thought-provoking novel.

            "This review highlights the intricacies of *Goddess of the River*, a captivating novel inspired by the Mahabharata that revolves around the river goddess, Ganga. The narrative employs flashbacks and memories from various visitors to Ganga's shores. However, titling these chapters could enhance clarity, helping readers navigate the shifts in perspective more easily. Ganga's journey is both tragic and inspiring; she is compelled into a mortal existence, giving birth to several children—including her son Devavrata, also known as Bhishma—while observing the lives of those along her banks. Bhishma serves as a secondary protagonist, grappling with his divine heritage and the political challenges of being a king's son. Through Ganga's viewpoint, we witness her son’s mortal life as he interacts with deities and family, ultimately facing choices that lead him away from his foundational morals and beliefs.",
            "I am continually impressed by the author's ability to retell classical epics in ways that resonate beautifully with contemporary readers. While Greek mythology often overshadows other traditions in modern Western literature, the author has introduced me to lesser-known stories that have sparked my curiosity to learn more. The narrative is engaging, and I found myself empathizing with the characters, as even the gods are portrayed with relatable human traits and emotions. However, as someone unfamiliar with these mythological figures, I occasionally struggled to keep track of the characters—though this is more a reflection of my own background knowledge than any shortcoming of the author."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Goddess of the River* is a captivating and emotionally resonant novel that showcases the author's talent for reimagining ancient tales. Despite my limited knowledge of Hindu mythology, I found the story engaging and beautifully written. I will absolutely be purchasing a hard copy when it is available.",

Ganga's story is both tragic and inspiring as she is forced into a mortal body, births several children before her son Devavrata/Bhishma, and observes the memories and actions of the humans on her banks. Bhishma is the secondary main character, and we see him explore his background as the child of a deity while navigating the political turmoil of being the son of a king. The story develops through Ganga's perspective as she watches her son live a mortal life, interacting with other deities, family members, and fate, which forces him into choices that steer him away from his core morals and beliefs.\n\n- **Readability and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The story was very readable, and I felt sympathy for the characters, as even the gods were given very human traits and emotions. However, as someone unfamiliar with these mythological figures, I did have some trouble keeping the characters straight (though this is no fault of the author and more due to my lack of background knowledge).\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story utilized flashbacks and memories of some of the visitors to Ganga's shores. It may have been helpful to title these chapters to clarify the transitions and help readers better understand the shifts in perspective.\n\n- **Author's Writing and Retelling Style:**  \n  I continue to be impressed with Patel's writing and her ability to retell classical epics in ways that are as beautiful and relevant today as they were in the past. While Greek mythology tends to dominate modern Western literature, Patel has opened my eyes to stories I was never aware of and has inspired me to learn more.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Goddess of the River* is a captivating and emotionally resonant novel that showcases Patel's talent for reimagining ancient tales. Despite my limited knowledge of Hindu mythology, I found the story engaging and beautifully written.

Her eventual liberation brings a profound joy, even as her emotions remain intertwined with her earthly existence.",

This little part of the Mahabharata makes me want to pick up the larger text and delve into more details relating to the story.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Clarity:**  \n  My only complaint is that the dual timeline confused me regarding Bhishma until I reached the explanation later in the story. I worry this might throw readers off and disrupt the flow, especially for those not familiar with Hindu mythology.

You will absolutely not regret it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully written mythological retelling that offers a fresh perspective on Hindu mythology, focusing on the Goddess Ganga and her journey.

In contrast, most other characters are powerful men marked by fragile egos and a tendency for violence and conquest. While this aligns with the story's themes, the prevalence of such characters is surprising.

            "*Goddess of the River* reimagines the epic Mahabharata, centering on Ganga and her son Bhishma. The narrative delves into their decisions over the years and the impact these choices have on the monumental war that follows. As someone unfamiliar with Ganga’s story, I found the author's presentation both accessible and engaging. The novel is intricate, featuring numerous characters and interwoven plotlines, which can make it challenging to follow. I often found myself re-reading sections and revisiting character identities to stay on track. The inclusion of a family tree in the published version will be a helpful tool for readers navigating this complex tale.",

This worked effectively, especially because the book introduces so many different characters. Seeing how different points of view and plot points relate to Ganga was really helpful.  \n\n- **Narrative Scope and Depth:**  \n  I enjoyed that the story didn’t just focus on the war but also explored the events leading up to and after the war.

It was particularly interesting to see how different characters justified their actions, often believing them to be morally correct based on their vows.  \n\n- **Impact of Divine Boons:**  \n  The boons given by the Gods were intriguing, especially in how they impacted the war by granting humans different skills or powers. The consequences of these boons on humanity and the course of various characters' lives were compelling, even when some Gods didn’t want to be involved.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I found the beginning and end of the book the most interesting. While the middle section dipped slightly for me in terms of character development and new plot points, the story definitely recovered in the last third, making it a worthwhile read overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed reading *Goddess of the River* and would highly recommend it, especially to fans of mythology retellings.

            "The novel boasts a large cast of characters, intricate lineages, and diverse settings. Despite the inclusion of a family tree, I found it difficult to keep track of the names and relationships, which occasionally disrupted my immersion in the story. The narrative follows Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges, and her son Bhishma as familial rivalries escalate into a massive war. Central to the plot is Bhishma’s struggle to uphold his dharma while seeking peace, alongside Ganga’s internal conflict regarding her time among humans. The story delves into dualities in characters and themes, exploring destruction as a means of rebirth, the complexities of choice—particularly for women—and the multifaceted nature of motherhood. These thought-provoking elements are beautifully woven into the narrative.",
            "The characters are richly layered, each exhibiting dual natures. Ganga represents both change and stubbornness, while Shiva’s boons enable humans to reshape their destinies. The human characters are equally complex; those seen as righteous possess significant flaws, and even the “bad guys” display moments of empathy. This nuanced portrayal adds considerable depth to the story.",

Especially because I grew up listening to stories from the Mahabharata, and it's very close to my heart.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  *Goddess of the River* is a gorgeous retelling of the Mahabharata from the perspective of two complex characters and somehow manages to narrate the enormous epic within 400 pages without making it feel rushed. It is told in four parts (named after various parts of the river Ganga), with the first part focusing solely on Ganga and the other three alternating between her and Bhishma's POV.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  After reading this, I realized how overlooked Ganga is in the Mahabharata. After all, it's her with whom it all began. I was invested in her POV more than I was in Bhishma's. Her character development from being tempestuous and disdainful of mortals to being compassionate and motherly was beautiful to read. Motherhood is a prevalent theme in the book.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Ending:**  \n  The ending was beautiful, and the last line remained with me even as I turned the last page.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I found this book to be more compelling than *Kaikeyi*.

I attempted to reconcile his commitment to his vow and his duty to the Kauravas. This book, narrated from Bhishma's perspective, sheds light on this complex figure and the motivations behind his choices. Interestingly, the story is named after Ganga—thankfully, the author refers to her as Ganga rather than Ganges. Through her eyes, we witness the unfolding events and decisions that ultimately lead to the downfall of the Kuru dynasty and the people of Hastinapur.",

Since then, I have picked up every English translation and retelling I could get my hands on. This one just jumped to the top of my favorites list!\n\n- **Relevance to Contemporary Issues:**  \n  Right now, with all that's going on in our world, a book about birthright and what land belongs to whom seemed very fitting. It reminded me that in the original Mahabharat, it says: “That which is found in this book is found everywhere.”\n\n- **Character Exploration (Bhishma):**  \n  Bhishma was always one of my favorite characters. Even though I had a hard time understanding his decision to stay quiet during Draupadi's humiliation, I tried to understand his honor to his vow and his duty to the Kauravas. This book, told from Bhishma's point of view, helps in understanding this complicated man and what drives him to make his decisions.\n\n- **Character Exploration (Ganga):**  \n  Ultimately, this book is named after Ganga (thankful the author called her Ganga and not Ganges), and told from her point of view as the river watches over all that happens and the decisions that are made, which ultimately bring about the destruction of the Kuru dynasty and the people of Hastinapur.\n\n- **Author's Writing Style and Retelling:**  \n  What I enjoyed so much was Patel's writing and her retelling of this ancient story from thousands of years ago that still felt so fitting to our times now. I hope she continues to write Indian Mythology retellings as she's quickly become one of my favorite authors.\n\n- **Missing Elements:**  \n  As a fan of the original story, I do admit I missed a lot of the love and devotion that Bhishma had for the Pandavas and they for him.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis retelling of The Mahabharat, focusing on Bhishma and Ganga, offers a fresh and relevant perspective on the ancient epic. Patel's writing brings the story to life in a way that resonates with contemporary issues, making it a standout addition to my collection of Mahabharat retellings.

Although Bhishma plays a significant role in the original epic, neither he nor Ganga are the main protagonists. The story delves into Ganga's experience of humanity after being cursed to live as a mortal, highlighting her observations of her son's struggles. As Bhishma grapples with the weight of his oaths and the impending war, the contrasting perspectives of Ganga—an outsider with a critical viewpoint—and Bhishma, who is deeply entangled in human conflict, create a captivating narrative.",

Her personal connections and outsider status offer a distinctive viewpoint. Bhishma is portrayed with remarkable complexity, grappling with the tension between duty and justice, and his human struggles are vividly illustrated. The contrast between Ganga's detached perspective and Bhishma's active involvement in the conflict is masterfully executed.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The novel is a retelling of the Mahabharata from the perspectives of Ganga and her son Bhishma. While Bhishma has a significant role in the original epic, neither he nor Ganga are the protagonists. The story explores Ganga's experience of humanity after being cursed to live as a human and her subsequent observations of her son's struggles. Bhishma, bound by his oaths, grapples with the consequences of his actions as a great war looms. The dual perspectives of Ganga, an outsider with a critical eye, and Bhishma, deeply enmeshed in human conflict, create a compelling narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga's perspective as a goddess outside of time adds depth to her character, allowing her to view the story with a critical lens. Her personal attachments and outsider status provide a unique viewpoint on the events. Bhishma's character is portrayed with complexity, torn between duty and justice, and his struggles with the burdens of humanity are vividly depicted. The contrast between Ganga's detached perspective and Bhishma's involvement in the conflict is superbly executed.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel delves into the complexities of motherhood and the roles of women in a patriarchal society. Ganga's perspective highlights the potential for preventing war, offering a critical examination of the events. The dual POV structure effectively contrasts the divine and human perspectives, enriching the exploration of duty, justice, and the consequences of actions.\n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  Patel's writing is praised for its ability to capture the intricacies of the characters and their struggles. The retelling is well-crafted, providing a fresh and engaging take on the Mahabharata. The novel is accessible to both those familiar with the epic and newcomers, offering a great flavor of the original story.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  The reviewer, who typically does not favor retellings, found this novel to be an exception. They appreciated seeing a story they grew up with reflected in the genre and highly recommend the book. The advanced copy was provided by Netgalley, the author, and Hachette US.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis retelling of the Mahabharata from the perspectives of Ganga and Bhishma is a masterful exploration of duty, justice, and the complexities of motherhood in a patriarchal society. The dual POV structure, combined with Patel's excellent writing, makes for a compelling and accessible narrative that both honors and reimagines the original epic. Highly recommended for fans of the Mahabharata and newcomers alike.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nHighly highly recommend!!"

            "The novel's strongest aspect is Ganga's perspective. I appreciated her growth and the author's deep understanding of her character. In contrast, Bhishma's chapters felt weak and unengaging, contributing little to the overall narrative. I would have preferred a more focused exploration of Ganga's journey, as it was far richer and more compelling.",
            "The prose is smooth, and the dialogue resonates beautifully. It's evident that the author possesses significant talent.",
            "The novel contains several historical inaccuracies that stood out to me, given my familiarity with the original tales.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the novel's concept, especially its exploration of the theme of mothers and their children. The relationships, such as those between Ganga and Bhishma and Kunti and Karna, were deeply felt and thoughtfully examined."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a solid retelling of the Mahabharata, with a strong focus on Ganga's perspective and the theme of motherhood. While the writing is beautiful and the exploration of Ganga's character is compelling, the sidelining of other women and the weaker chapters from Bhishma's perspective detract from the novel's potential. Despite its flaws, it has the potential to introduce the stories of the Mahabharata to a new audience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Concept and Theme:**  \n  I very much enjoyed the concept of the novel, particularly the exploration of the theme of mothers and their children. Whether it was Ganga and Bhishma or Kunti and Karna, their feelings were palpable and well-explored.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The strongest part of the novel is Ganga's perspective. I loved the way she grew and changed over time, and the author had a very strong sense of her character. However, I found Bhishma's chapters weak and uninteresting, as they didn’t add much to the story. I would have preferred the novel to focus solely on Ganga's perspective, which was far richer and more compelling.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Women:**  \n  I didn’t like how other women were sidelined to highlight Ganga's strength. Draupadi, for instance, is a fiery and nuanced character in the original tales, but in this novel, she is reduced to a meek caricature. As someone who grew up with these stories, I felt that the women in the Mahabharata are complex and interesting, but they were not given the same depth in this retelling.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is mellifluous, and the dialogue sings off the page. It’s clear that the author is a talented writer.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy:**  \n  There are some historical inaccuracies in the novel, which I noticed as a reader familiar with the original tales.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a solid retelling of the Mahabharata, with a strong focus on Ganga's perspective and the theme of motherhood. While the writing is beautiful and the exploration of Ganga's character is compelling, the sidelining of other women and the weaker chapters from Bhishma's perspective detract from the novel's potential.

These themes are portrayed with such depth and beauty that they resonated deeply with me.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is told from two points of view—the protagonist and her son—but what blew my mind was how each perspective is set in a different timeline. The past narrative helps immensely in understanding the present events, creating a layered and immersive reading experience.\n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I did some research and found out this is the author’s second book.

This dual POV structure ultimately undermines the story's cohesion and impact.",

She was intricately developed, with each of her relationships uniquely defined, showcasing a complex and compelling bond with everyone around her. Her journey, from watching her son grow from childhood to his ultimate fate at the end of the Mahabharata, was both beautiful and heart-wrenching. The portrayal of her struggles as an immortal navigating a mortal world with a mortal son was particularly well done. However, the book's attempt at impartiality toward the characters sometimes cast Duryodhan in a more sympathetic light, overshadowing his true depiction as pure evil."

Everything about her was so perfectly crafted.  \n  - Every relationship of hers was unique, and she had such a complex and strong bond with every character she associated with.  \n  - Her journey of seeing her own son from childhood to becoming what he did at the end of the Mahabharata was beautiful yet heartbreaking.  \n  - Her struggles of being an immortal in a mortal world with a mortal son were portrayed really well.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  - I loved the story of Shiva and Ganga and how complex her relationship was with him.  \n  - However, some of the decisions the author took regarding the main storyline made less impact for me.  \n  - One such scene was downplaying Draupadi’s cheer haran. I couldn’t understand the motive behind downplaying another woman’s arc for a book that focused so heavily on Ganga and her story.  \n\n- **Character Portrayal and Impartiality:**  \n  - This book tried so hard to be impartial toward any of the characters that it kind of ended up putting Duryodhan in a gray light rather than the pure evil that he was.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved the book for its beautifully crafted portrayal of Ganga and her complex relationships, as well as her emotional journey. However, I had mixed feelings about certain decisions in the storyline, particularly the downplaying of Draupadi’s arc and the portrayal of Duryodhan.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The story follows Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges, who is cursed to live as a mortal. In her human form, she navigates complex relationships and political intrigues, including marrying a king and facing challenging decisions. The narrative poignantly captures her longing for her son and her reflections on humanity after returning to her divine form. The first half of the book is lyrical and immersive, while the second half shifts focus to human politics and characters, which diminishes some of its initial charm.",
            "Ganga's character is captivating, particularly her journey to adapt to human life and her emotional evolution as both a mother and a goddess. While the human characters and political dynamics are well-crafted, they pale in comparison to the depth of Ganga's personal story.",
            "The writing is beautifully lyrical, especially in the book's first half. However, the tone shifts in the second half with the introduction of more political and human elements. While still well-crafted, these sections feel less enchanting than the earlier ones.",
            "The novel skillfully juxtaposes mythology and humanity, illustrating Ganga's journey from divine being to mortal and back. It explores the emotional and moral complexities of her experiences, highlighting her heartbreak and the harsh realities of human existence."

Writing about a character who is a river half the time is challenging, but I really enjoyed it.  \n\n- **Research and Authenticity:**  \n  The book was well-researched, and I appreciated that the author didn’t italicize ethnic words, which is something I usually dislike in other books.  \n\n- **Reader Preparation:**  \n  I would recommend having some knowledge of the Mahabharata before reading this book, as the dynamics Vaishnavi Patel builds on might be confusing otherwise. A quick scan of Wikipedia could help.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n  I’m incredibly excited to see what story the author writes next!

It emphasizes the idea that choosing the right path and having good intentions is more important than simply fulfilling one’s commitments or being honorable.\n\n- **Character Development and Clarity:**  \n  Keeping up with all the characters was a bit confusing at times. However, I appreciated the depth and complexity of Ganga’s character and her transformation throughout the story.\n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Exposure:**  \n  I enjoyed how the book exposed me to stories from the Mahabharata, a text I’m not very familiar with. It provided a fascinating glimpse into this rich mythological tradition.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be an engaging and thought-provoking read. While the multitude of characters was occasionally confusing, the thematic depth and cultural insights made it a worthwhile experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Story and Retelling:**  \n  The novel is a sparkling retelling of the goddess Ganga, derived from the Mahabharata text. It portrays Ganga as a powerful force, both as a deity and an observer, and explores her role as the wife of Shantanu and the mother of the eight Vasus, including Bhishma. The story is full of conflicts, battles, and spirituality, making it a compelling read.\n\n- **Empowerment and Agency:**  \n  I appreciate how the retelling empowers women and gives them agency. Ganga’s character is particularly compelling as she navigates her cursed life as a mortal, sacrificing her children to the water so they may be reincarnated as spiritual beings.\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  The book has a simplicity and beauty that I instantly connected with. While it isn’t as deep or rich in prose as *Kaikeyi*, it has a lovely rhythm and is quite short, making it an accessible and enjoyable read.\n\n- **Cultural and Spiritual Significance:**  \n  Hinduism has always intrigued me, and I found Ganga’s legend to be worth knowing. The novel offers a fascinating glimpse into her story and the spiritual themes surrounding her.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Goddess Of The River* is a beautifully crafted retelling of Ganga’s legend, blending spirituality, conflict, and empowerment. While it may not delve as deeply into prose as some other works, its simplicity and rhythm make it a captivating and accessible read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in ancient retellings and Hindu mythology.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the pacing falters in the middle and towards the end, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n- **Mythological Accuracy and Interpretation:**  \n  As someone familiar with the myths and having read books on the Mahabharata, I appreciate the author's attempt to retell the story. It’s a commendable effort, though it didn’t fully resonate with me in certain aspects.\n\n- **Female Representation:**  \n  While the book is framed as a story from a female perspective, it delves less into the female characters of the Mahabharata. For instance, we see Kunti but not much of Gandhari, and while Amba’s story is well-portrayed (a part I really liked), Draupadi and Subhadra are largely overlooked. Similarly, Krishna and Shiva are prominent, but Parvati and Mother Nature herself are underrepresented.\n\n- **Character Highlights:**  \n  Some parts of the book stood out to me, particularly the portrayal of Karna, Amba, and the maturity arc of Ganga herself. These elements were compelling and added depth to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book starts strong with an engaging premise and a unique perspective, but it struggles with pacing and uneven representation of female characters.

The narrative intriguingly intertwines Ganga with the Mahabharata, a connection I had previously viewed as separate. Unlike *Kaikeyi*, which centers on a single character, *Goddess of the River* explores multiple perspectives. While this approach slightly disappointed me, it ultimately enriches Ganga’s story and its underlying messages.",

Ganga’s sections tended to ramble, introducing various epic characters and backstories that detracted from a cohesive narrative. A more linear approach would have made it easier to follow the characters and their relationships. While the novel does become more linear as it nears the Great War, this shift occurs too late to fully restore my engagement.",

However, once Bhishma’s viewpoint is introduced in part two, my interest waned. The numerous godling princes and rajas became confusing, making it difficult to keep track of their identities. Although flashbacks eventually clarified their roles, the time jumps disrupted the pacing and complicated the narrative.",

The novel’s attempt to condense a sprawling epic into 400 pages resulted in a disjointed narrative that was hard to follow. As a feminist retelling, it is more subtle than *Kaikeyi*, which I found less engaging. Ultimately, I felt the story would have benefited from a more linear structure and better character introductions.",

Unlike *Kaikeyi*, which I enjoyed without prior knowledge of the Ramayana, this novel felt inaccessible without a background in the source material. I think I would have preferred reading the original Mahabharata instead.\n\n- **Character Focus and Development:**  \n  Patel does a good job of fleshing out Ganga’s perspective, making her relevant when she is often overlooked in the original text. However, once Bhishma’s perspective is introduced in part two, I lost interest. The multitude of godling princes and rajas became confusing, and I struggled to keep them straight. While flashbacks eventually clarified their roles, the time jumps disrupted the pacing and made the story harder to follow.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt jarring, especially after Bhishma’s introduction. Ganga’s sections started to ramble, introducing random epic characters and backstories instead of maintaining a focused narrative. I would have preferred a more linear story, which would have helped me keep track of the characters and their relationships. The novel does become more linear as it approaches the Great War, but this shift came too late to fully salvage my engagement.\n\n- **Themes and Feminist Retelling:**  \n  The central theme of dharma—doing what is right versus fulfilling vows—is well-explored, though it doesn’t diverge significantly from the original text. While this is a feminist retelling, it is far more subtle compared to *Kaikeyi*. I missed the subversive nature of Patel’s previous work, though there were still some nice moments of character growth, particularly for the divine beings.\n\n- **Prose and Writing Style:**  \n  Patel’s prose is beautiful, as always, and there were moments I genuinely enjoyed. However, the overall structure and pacing issues overshadowed the quality of the writing for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Goddess of the River* has its strengths, including Ganga’s perspective and Patel’s beautiful prose, it struggles with accessibility, pacing, and character focus. The novel’s attempt to condense a sprawling epic into 400 pages resulted in a disjointed narrative that was hard to follow. As a feminist retelling, it is more subtle than *Kaikeyi*, which I found less engaging. Ultimately, I felt the story would have benefited from a more linear structure and better character introductions.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded down."

            "This retelling of the Hindu epic Mahabharata centers on Ganga, the river goddess who descends from the heavens and is compelled to live on Earth. Her intricate relationship with humanity unfolds as she cares for seven Vasus (godlings). When the Vasus engage in mischief, both they and Ganga are cursed, leading her to become mortal and bear the seven Vasus before they can reclaim their immortality. However, her final son, Bhisma, clings to his humanity, prompting a profound exploration of mortality and morality. The book includes content warnings for infanticide, casteism, and ableism.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot:**  \n  This is a retelling from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, focusing on Ganga, the goddess of the river, who falls from the heavenly realm and is forced to stay on Earth. She has a complex relationship with humans and cares for seven Vasus (godlings). When the Vasus cause mischief, both they and Ganga are cursed. Ganga becomes mortal and must birth the seven Vasus before they can regain immortality. However, her last son, Bhisma, clings to his humanity, forcing them to confront what it means to be mortal and moral. The book includes content warnings for infanticide, casteism, and ableism. The author provides ample cultural context, which I found enlightening as someone unfamiliar with Hinduism beyond the Trimurti.  \n\n- **Pros:**  \n  This is a feminist retelling of one of the longest pieces of Indian literature, condensed into 400 pages—an impressive feat. Patel uses Ganga’s story to explore a woman’s place across various circumstances, from celestial freedom to mortal imprisonment. Ganga is a deeply complex character, often perceived as flighty and vindictive but ultimately a caring spirit thwarted by men. By the end, she embraces her full power, echoing characters like Circe. The first half of the book is gripping, with Ganga’s constant tragedy evoking strong emotions. The juxtaposition of her desire to revert the Vasus to immortals with the unthinkable actions she must take creates a unique narrative. Patel’s writing is beautiful, particularly the cosmic descriptors of Ganga’s worldview.  \n\n- **Cons:**  \n  The middle of the book slows down significantly, with shifts in time and perspective. Instead of focusing solely on Ganga, the narrative delves into Bhisma’s story and the political dynamics of Hastinapur. Frequent allusions to “the war” and royal family conflicts can be confusing, especially for audio listeners. Bhisma is a frustrating character, overly devoted to his vows, which leads to unjustifiable actions, particularly in his treatment of women. While he serves as an interesting foil to Ganga, his behavior is hard to read at times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully written, feminist retelling of a lesser-known story from the Mahabharata, offering a unique exploration of Ganga’s journey through tragedy, power, and self-discovery. While the middle section slows down and shifts focus, the overall narrative is compelling and thought-provoking, especially for fans of mythology retellings like Madeline Miller’s works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars for the writing and unique narrative perspective."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Familiarity with Source Material:**  \n  I went into this book completely blind, as I’m not familiar with Indian mythology. While I found it interesting to explore perspectives of Gods from another culture, my lack of knowledge about the source material likely influenced my experience.  \n\n- **Narration and Story Progression:**  \n  The narration and overall progression of the story didn’t work well for me. The first part, told from Ganga’s perspective, was fine, but the second part became confusing when it split between Ganga and Bhishma’s perspectives. Bhishma’s storyline jumps far into the future without clear context, and I initially didn’t realize who he was due to the lack of explanation about his name change.  \n\n- **Character Introduction and Development:**  \n  The second part introduces too many characters at once, and only a few were memorable enough for me to recall them consistently. I frequently had to refer to the family tree to understand relationships, which became frustrating after a while. I felt the characters could have been introduced more effectively.  \n\n- **Synopsis Accuracy:**  \n  The synopsis was misleading, as it primarily covers the first part and only hints at the second. The bulk of the book focuses on a civil war within the royal family, driven by childhood feuds, poor decision-making, and, at times, sheer stupidity. While this wasn’t a major issue for me, I noticed other reviewers felt misled by the synopsis.  \n\n- **Feminist Twist and Character Roles:**  \n  The book was marketed as having a feminist twist, but Ganga’s role felt diminished after the first part. Her perspective became limited, and the key characters driving the story were predominantly men, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing itself was strong, and I didn’t feel like I had to force myself to keep reading. However, the story became increasingly difficult to follow as it progressed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of retelling an Indian myth with a feminist twist was intriguing, the execution fell short for me. The confusing narrative structure, overwhelming number of characters, and misleading synopsis detracted from my enjoyment. Despite the strong writing, the story became hard to follow, and Ganga’s limited role in the latter part of the book was a letdown.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Book Club Experience and Context:**  \n  I joined the Fantastic Strangelings Book Club through Nowhere Bookshop during the pandemic, which provided a sense of community. The online format appealed to me due to its flexibility, as I often struggle with the time commitments of traditional book clubs. One of the monthly picks was *Kaikeyi*, which became one of my favorite books that year. When I learned Vaishnavi Patel had a new book, *Goddess of the River*, I was eager to read it without even knowing the description.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I was just as impressed with *Goddess of the River* as I was with *Kaikeyi*. Patel’s retellings stand out to me because they allow myths and legends to evolve, which is often overlooked in traditional retellings. Many myths focus on male heroics, sidelining women’s stories or reducing them to minor roles. Patel’s approach gives these women a voice and depth.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Themes:**  \n  Hearing Ganga’s story from her perspective was deeply moving. The novel explores her transformation from a mother forced into impossible choices to a being who evolves through her experiences. It’s a story of how small and large decisions culminate in death and destruction, marking the end of an era. The novel has all the elements of an epic, with rich storytelling and emotional depth.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, though I regret not savoring it more. I’ve already pre-ordered the print copy and am considering the audio format, which I think would enhance the experience. I highly recommend *Goddess of the River* to fans of mythic retellings, fantasy, and the supernatural. Even if these genres aren’t your usual preference, I still encourage you to give it a try. It’s a remarkable novel.\n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  I received an Advance Reader’s Copy (ARC) from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a powerful and moving retelling of Ganga’s story, offering a fresh perspective on mythic narratives. Vaishnavi Patel’s ability to evolve traditional tales while giving voice to overlooked characters makes this novel a standout. I highly recommend it to readers of all genres.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The themes are clear and well-executed, and I appreciate the intentionality behind Vaishnavi Patel's writing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga's growth is compelling and beautifully portrayed. However, Bhishma was frustrating and annoying to me. While his struggles are central to the story, I found him weak and lacking common sense, which made it hard to respect him.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  The novel excels in presenting morally complex characters. No one is strictly good or evil, and even minor characters have true agency, which adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Comparison to *Kaikeyi*:**  \n  I still prefer *Kaikeyi* over this book. *Kaikeyi* focuses intensely on its titular character, a mortal woman whose struggles and inevitable doom felt more relatable and emotionally gripping. While I loved Ganga, her divine nature made her journey feel less precarious.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The writing and storytelling are emotionally riveting, especially the ending paragraphs from Ganga's perspective, which were beautiful and impactful.  \n\n- **World-Building and Clarity:**  \n  The family tree of the Mahabharata was initially confusing, but by the end of the book, everything made sense. The complexity of the family dynamics was overwhelming at first but ultimately rewarding.  \n\n- **Author's Background:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel's dual career as a civil rights lawyer and a bestselling author is impressive and adds to my admiration for her work.  \n\n- **Personal Preferences:**  \n  I haven’t liked any incarnation of Vishnu in the two books I’ve read by Patel, and I’m over him as a character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a thought-provoking exploration of complex themes and characters, with standout moments like Ganga's growth and the emotionally resonant ending.

While the multitude of stories and relationships can make some chapters challenging to follow, which slightly detracts from the overall enjoyment, the author skillfully highlights key plot details. A clearer understanding of these relationships would have further enriched the reading experience. The narrative retells the Mahabharata from the perspective of Ganga, the river goddess cursed to bear mortal children, as she strives to guide her son, Bhishma. The story masterfully presents the world through both human and divine lenses, each navigating a rapidly changing landscape.",

While war plays a significant role in the story, it is explored through the lens of character experiences rather than battle logistics, making it accessible even to those who typically shy away from the topic. The narrative weaves an intriguing and poetic tale of human connections, particularly the bond between mother and child, and the challenges of striving for our best selves in a complex world."

            "The story loses its focus when it shifts from Ganga to an extensive cast of over ten new characters. This abrupt transition, combined with a non-linear narrative filled with asides and flashbacks, creates a clunky reading experience. However, the final quarter of the book reverts to a more linear timeline, centering on Ganga and Bhishma, ultimately delivering a stunning and satisfying conclusion.",

Ganga, the goddess-turned-mortal-turned-goddess-again, stands out as a testament to Patel's character-building prowess. The narrative truly shines when it revolves around Ganga, feeling both intentional and insightful. However, the expanded focus on a broad cast of side characters, particularly Bhishma’s extended family across three generations, makes it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.",

Those comfortable with navigating complex family dynamics and referring to the frontmatter will find the story rewarding.

The exploration of ethical dilemmas and the engaging pacing kept me hooked throughout. I appreciate the cultural representation and the effort to bring lesser-known mythological stories to a wider audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 out of 5 stars."

            "This novel offers a vivid retelling of the tale of Ganga, the river goddess, and her mortal son, Devavrata. It delves into themes such as the consequences of actions, family bonds, duty, and the value of life. The narrative remains engaging throughout, skillfully balancing its profound themes without becoming dull. The beginning is particularly captivating, as it portrays Ganga's adjustment to her new mortal existence and her unfamiliarity with humanity. However, the middle to end sections can feel somewhat weighed down by political complexities and character tracking. Nonetheless, the story's depth is impressive, featuring well-developed character arcs and thoughtful thematic exploration.",
            "Ganga's character is both captivating and poignant, as her perceptions of humanity and her purpose evolve significantly. Devavrata (Bhishma) offers an intriguing perspective, particularly regarding war and his journey from childhood to adulthood. The author skillfully develops Devavrata's character, even if he can be frustrating at times.",

            "The portrayal of Ganga in the novel is frustrating and inconsistent with her traditional depiction. She is depicted as annoying and absurd, undermining her established character as a strong and proud goddess. Additionally, the relationship between Krishna and Ganga is inaccurately represented, as they are generations apart in the Mahabharata and never interact. The brother-sister dynamic between Ganga and Vishnu is entirely fabricated and lacks any basis in the original texts. Furthermore, Ganga's relationship with Shiv is misrepresented; in the original stories, she is the elder sister of Parvati and shares a respectful dynamic with Shiv, rather than the resentful one depicted in the novel.",
            "The novel notably distorts the timeline and relationships of key characters, incorrectly placing Krishna and Ganga in the same generation. Ganga’s origins as the daughter of Raja Himavan and Rani Mainavati, her descent to Earth to assist Bhagirath, and her interactions with Shiv are misrepresented. Additionally, the omission of Shikhandi’s identity as a trans man and Bhishma’s transphobia is a significant misrepresentation of the original narrative."

The author’s attempts to evoke sympathy for Ganga by altering established stories and vilifying other characters ultimately fail, resulting in a story that feels inauthentic and poorly executed.",

The Mahabharata is my favorite epic, and I’ve been obsessed with reading all its different versions and retellings. I was incredibly excited for this book.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I loved both Ganga's and Bhishma's characterizations, as well as Shiva and Krishna's characters. Ganga's emotional journey was written so masterfully that I was in tears reading it. Her experience with mortality and understanding humans was a delight to read.  \n\n- **Narrative and Perspective:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel has done an amazing job telling the story of the Mahabharata through Ganga's and Bhishma's perspectives. The book adds new perspective and understanding of what dharma truly means, making it a valuable addition to Mahabharata retellings.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  Even though I knew the trajectory of the story, there was never a boring moment. In fact, it was quite refreshing, just like Ganga is.  \n\n- **Faithfulness to the Source Material:**  \n  While *Goddess of the River* might not be faithful to the letter of the Mahabharata, I really like the changes. The addition of magic has helped it remain faithful to the spirit of the epic.  \n\n- **Complexity and Depth:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel shows the complexities of both sides of the story, which made me question what dharma truly means. I think *Goddess of the River* provides a good answer to this question.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  This book made me feel so much. I was stunned and still crying after finishing it, which is rare for me. There is so much love and feeling in this book.  \n\n- **Author’s Growth:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel has improved so much as a writer. *Kaikeyi* was amazing, but this book is even better. It’s one of those books you’ll love forever, keep thinking about, and reread.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a masterful retelling of the Mahabharata that adds depth, perspective, and emotional resonance to the epic. Vaishnavi Patel’s storytelling is captivating, and the book is a valuable addition to the genre.

            "One common critique is the difficulty in keeping track of the numerous characters. I'm pleased to hear that the final edition will include a family tree, which will be quite helpful. Reading on my Kindle allowed me to search for characters when I was uncertain, a feature I found invaluable. It's important to note that the narrative primarily focuses on just two characters, Ganga and her son, Bhishma, within an epic that spans 100,000 couplets and features over 2,000 characters. As a result, not all characters are fully developed.",
            "This story delves into the complexities of self-discovery and moral ambiguity. It emphasizes that true understanding comes from within, suggesting that one day, we will find the answers that lead to happiness. The narrative challenges the notion of promises, asserting that Dharma encompasses much more than mere commitments. A thought-provoking dialogue between characters raises the question of whether a person's wishes hold significance or if they should be evaluated solely by their actions. Ultimately, the story conveys that in a world devoid of clear right or wrong, we are left to navigate the burdens of our choices.",
            "I eagerly anticipate the author's upcoming third book, set to release in 2025, as her storytelling has truly resonated with me. I particularly enjoyed the retelling of Ganga’s story, which holds special significance for me, as watching the Mahabharat on VHS was a cherished family tradition during my childhood. This connection added depth to my reading experience, prompting me to re-watch the 1988 series while diving into the book, further enhancing my appreciation for the author's work."

While the complexity of characters may pose a challenge, the focus on Ganga and Bhishma, along with the exploration of Dharma, makes for a deeply engaging read. I highly recommend this book and am excited for the author’s future works.",

This connection made the book even more meaningful to me. I even began re-watching the 1988 series while reading the book, which deepened my appreciation for Patel’s work.\n\n- **Transformation of the Classic Tale:**  \n  Patel’s reimagining of Ganga’s story, particularly her focus on Ganga’s curse, was beautifully executed. It was fascinating to see how she transformed the classic tale into something fresh and compelling.\n\n- **Character Complexity and Clarity:**  \n  One critique I’ve seen is that it can be challenging to follow all the characters. I’m glad the final copy will include a family tree, as it will be very helpful. Reading on my Kindle allowed me to search for characters when I was unsure, which was a useful feature. It’s important to note that this story focuses on only two characters in an epic that spans 100,000 couplets and over 2,000 characters. Naturally, not all characters are fully explained, as the story centers on Ganga and her son, Bhishma.\n\n- **Themes and Philosophical Depth:**  \n  I appreciated the strong focus on Dharma and the exploration of the “right way of living.” The book raised profound questions about self-knowledge, promises, and the weight of choices. Some quotes that resonated with me include:  \n  - “Only you can know yourself. But one day, you will hold the answer, and I promise you will be happier then.”  \n  - “Dharma is much more than keeping your promises.”  \n  - “‘Do a person’s wishes matter?’ Karina asked. ‘Or is it their actions on which they should be judged?’”  \n  - “There were no good choices in this world, only the weight of those choices.”\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I look forward to seeing more from Vaishnavi Patel, including her third book set to release in 2025. Her storytelling has left a lasting impression on me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPatel’s retelling of Ganga’s story is a beautiful and thought-provoking reimagining of a classic tale. While the complexity of characters may pose a challenge, the focus on Ganga and Bhishma, along with the exploration of Dharma, makes for a deeply engaging read. I highly recommend this book and am excited for Patel’s future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 ⭐️ (rounded up for GoodReads).  \n\nThank you to the author and publisher for offering me this e-ARC through NetGalley."

            "The novel presents a captivating female lead, Ganga, who embodies a compelling contradiction of power and powerlessness at the core of her journey. Alongside her mortal son, both characters are flawed yet intriguing, sharing the narrative as an immortal mother and her mortal child. In contrast to the author's previous work, *Kaikeyi*, *Goddess of the River* features fewer significant female supporting characters, with other women often relegated to minor roles as victims of abuse.",
            "The novel is skillfully written, highlighting the author's talent as a storyteller. However, it falls short of the heights achieved by *Kaikeyi*, largely due to the inherent limitations of its narrative.",
            "The novel delves into misogyny and the harsh constraints imposed on women in its society. In contrast to *Kaikeyi*, where the protagonist forges significant, albeit fragile, connections with men, *Goddess of the River* presents a world where mortal women cannot anticipate genuine love or kindness from men. The narrative highlights the unyielding cruelty women endure, devoid of any moments of triumph, resulting in a more somber reading experience.",

        "conclusion": "*Goddess of the River* is a vivid retelling of an Indian mythological saga, featuring a compelling yet tragic female lead. While it is well-written and explores important themes of misogyny and women’s limitations, it lacks the depth of female relationships and moments of triumph found in the author’s previous work, *Kaikeyi*. This makes it a more somber and less uplifting read, though it still showcases the author’s storytelling prowess.",

Other women in the story play only minor roles, often as victims of abuse.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  - The novel explores misogyny and the painful limitations placed on women in its society.  \n  - Unlike *Kaikeyi*, where the titular heroine forms important, though sometimes tenuous, bonds with men, *Goddess of the River* portrays a world where mortal women cannot expect honest love or kindness from men.  \n  - The story emphasizes the relentless cruelty faced by women, with no moments of triumph, making it a more depressing read.  \n\n- **Writing and Craftsmanship:**  \n  - The novel is well-written and well-crafted, showcasing Vaishnavi Patel’s skill as a storyteller.  \n  - Despite its strengths, it doesn’t reach the heights of *Kaikeyi*, partly due to the nature of the story itself.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Anticipation:**  \n  - Vaishnavi Patel has earned a place among the writer’s whose next work I’m eager to read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a vivid retelling of an Indian mythological saga, featuring a compelling yet tragic female lead.

As someone fascinated but intimidated by Hindu religion and mythology, I appreciated the author’s ability to introduce complex genealogies and backstories in a natural and accessible way. The use of memories to convey information added emotional depth and prevented overwhelming the reader.\n\n- **Character Complexity and Themes:**  \n  Ganga and Bhishma are portrayed as deeply complex characters, grappling with themes of righteousness, the role of Gods in the human world, and the consequences of their actions. Ganga’s contemplation of the Hindu Caste system, where she questions its divine origin and attributes it to powerful men seeking to maintain control, was a standout moment.

Her imperfections, confusion, and frustrations added depth to her character, and her experience of motherhood was the most powerful element of the book for me.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The timeline was occasionally confusing due to the span of events. While I appreciated the philosophical exploration of duty and dharma, I wished for more perspectives and deeper dives into these themes. Some scenes felt like they could have been longer or more intense to fully capture the emotional weight of the story.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Representation:**  \n  As someone only slightly familiar with Hindu myth, I cannot comment on the accuracy of the divine representation compared to the Mahabharata. However, I enjoyed the retelling and the elements that were focused on and drawn out, making it accessible for readers like me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t love the book and felt it could have been more immersive, I appreciated its exploration of heavy themes, its philosophical depth, and Ganga’s compelling perspective. It’s a meaningful retelling of the Mahabharata that introduces these stories to a broader audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of meddling gods and misguided humans. The pride of men ignites a war that could have been averted through compromise, echoing themes familiar to many Americans from Greek epics like *The Odyssey* and *The Iliad*. Having recently read both, I found the stories strikingly similar. Ganga's perspective adds a unique dimension, as she occasionally takes human form, providing an outsider's view of humanity. The portrayal of mothers anxiously watching their children fight in war is particularly compelling, offering a rarely explored perspective in fantasy literature.",

Like *Kaikeyi*, this book takes a traditional story and expands it from the perspective of a woman—here, the River Ganga.\n\n- **Narrative and Themes:**  \n  I enjoyed this tale of meddling gods and misguided humans. The pride of men leads them to a war that could have been avoided with compromise. It’s a classic story that many Americans will recognize from Greek epics like *The Odyssey* and *The Iliad*. Having read both recently, I found the tales similar. The perspective of Ganga adds a unique flavor, as she takes human form at times and offers an outsider’s view of humanity. The portrayal of mothers watching their children fight in a war with anxiety was particularly compelling, as this perspective is rarely explored in most fantasy novels.\n\n- **Characterization and Clarity:**  \n  While there is much to love, I felt the characters were not differentiated enough, which made the plot hard to follow at times. With names that are sometimes very similar and a large cast of characters, I rely on context to keep track of who’s who, and that context was missing.\n\n- **Cultural and Educational Value:**  \n  If you enjoy retellings of myths, this is a great introduction to the Hindu epic, the *Mahabharata*. The notes at the end provide excellent options for readers who want to dig deeper into the scholarship on the epic.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Goddess of the River* is a compelling retelling of a classic epic, offering a fresh perspective through the eyes of Ganga. While the large cast of characters and lack of differentiation made the plot challenging to follow at times, the themes, narrative, and cultural depth make it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of myth retellings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

The intricate Mahabharata family tree and the delayed character backstories added to the complexity, making this part difficult to follow.

It’s an impressive feat and well worth reading.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I don’t think *Goddess of the River* is as successful as *Kaikeyi*. The latter, Patel’s feminist reimagining of the Ramayana, was one of my favorite reads of 2022. Patel excelled in making a classic villain a sympathetic, complex character, which felt like a correction of male-authored narratives.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  *Goddess of the River* struggles thematically, particularly in its exploration of justice and dharma (duty). This is primarily seen through Bhishma, Ganga’s mortal godling son, who repeatedly makes choices and supports leaders he knows are wrong, prioritizing keeping his word above all else. This exploration felt frustrating at times.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ganga):**  \n  I wanted more from Ganga herself.

            "In the story, Ganga primarily serves as an observer of the Mahabharata epic. While her role in transporting both Krishna and Karna is significant, much of her knowledge comes from the memories of others. This reliance on external perspectives feels like a deus ex machina, filling narrative gaps rather than enhancing the story.",
            "The omission of Shikhandi's identity as a trans man was disappointing. He was Draupadi's brother, not just a random peasant's child. While interpretations vary on whether Shikhandi was born a man or transformed after his life as Amba, this was a missed opportunity to embrace his transgender narrative. Ganga's perspective was intriguing; her struggle to view humans as significant was compelling. Once she became a mother and invested in Bhishma's life, she began to understand humanity and even display human emotions. However, I found her conflict with Shiva somewhat unclear, though it seemed necessary to establish her as a protagonist. I appreciated that all characters, including the gods, were portrayed as deeply flawed. Krishna, in particular, was striking; despite his emphasis on Dharma, he instigated conflict between brothers and families, leading to widespread destruction just to place Yudhishtir on the throne."

He was born not that long before the Pandavas were born. If Krishna was that old, he would be much older than Bhishma, not the other way around.\n\n- **Representation of Characters:**  \n  The erasure of Shikhandi being a trans-man was disappointing. He was a brother of Draupadi, not some random child of peasants. While there are differences in interpretations about whether Shikhandi was born a man or transformed after his life as Amba, this would have been a great opportunity to embrace his transgender story.\n\n- **Character Development (Ganga):**  \n  Ganga's POV was nice. I liked that she struggled with thinking of humans as non-trivial. Once she became a mother and invested in Bhishma's life, she was able to learn more about humanity and even exhibit some human behavior. I didn’t fully understand her strife with Shiva, but I guess it was necessary to give Ganga protagonist vibes.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Continuity:**  \n  The majority of the story was Ganga witnessing the unfolding of the Mahabharata epic. I understand that she was part of the transportation of both Krishna and Karna, but much of what she knew was gleaned from others' memories. This felt like a bit of a deus ex machina to fill gaps in the narrative.\n\n- **Portrayal of Flaws in Characters:**  \n  I appreciated that every character was shown as deeply flawed, even the gods. Especially Krishna, who touted that Dharma was the most important thing, yet he pitted brother against brother, family against family, and caused the destruction of so many people and lands just to put Yudhishtir on the throne.\n\n- **Desire for Alternative Perspectives:**  \n  I’m still waiting for a Duryodhan POV. Perhaps I’ll have to write it myself.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some strong elements, such as Ganga’s character development and the portrayal of flawed characters, it fell short in accurately representing historical timelines and certain characters like Shikhandi.

The author’s portrayal of the characters helps bridge the gap between the ancient myth and a modern fantasy novel.  \n\n- **Faithfulness to Source Material:**  \n  While the author makes some changes, they retain key elements of the original epic, including its more objectionable aspects like the caste system. This inclusion is impressive as it highlights how these elements were originally used to maintain social stability and how their association with divinity continues to influence parts of the Indian subcontinent.  \n\n- **Accessibility and Appeal:**  \n  The novel serves as a fantastic introduction to the Mahabharata for readers who, like me, have been hesitant to approach the original text. It is well-written and engaging, making it accessible to those unfamiliar with Indian mythology while also appealing to fans of thought-provoking fantasy set in non-Western universes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling and accessible retelling of the story of Lady Ganga and Bhishma from the Mahabharata. It successfully balances philosophical depth with engaging storytelling, making it an excellent choice for readers interested in Indian mythology or those seeking a thought-provoking fantasy novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is told from two perspectives, and I found the portrayal of a god grappling with mortality particularly intriguing. Ganga's experiences—her struggles as a divine being trapped in a mortal body, the birth of her godlings, the loss of her son, and her subsequent encounter with humanity—are skillfully woven into her character development, making her sections the most compelling to read. In contrast, I found Bhishma's perspective less engaging. I struggled to connect with his character and was frustrated by his choices, especially as they led to devastating consequences.",
            "I appreciated the book's unflinching exploration of the darker aspects of life and war, but there were moments when I found it easy to set aside. This ultimately prevented it from earning a 4-star rating from me."

Since this book is based on the Mahabharata, an epic I am unfamiliar with, I did a little research as I read. I found learning more about the culture and history of Hinduism fascinating.  \n\n- **Character Complexity and Development:**  \n  The story is split into two POVs. I found the way Patel wrote the view of a god being tainted with mortality intriguing, and it made Ganga's parts more compelling to read. Her pain as a god stuck in a mortal body, giving birth to godlings, losing her son, and the aftermath of her brush with humanity are woven well with her character development. These were definitely my favorite parts to read. On the other hand, I found Bhishma's POV less captivating. I did not like his character or his choices, especially when they led to devastating consequences.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  There were parts of the book that felt slow, and some of the themes Patel is trying to convey came off a little heavy-handed. I wished for a more linear timeline, as I sometimes found myself confused by what was happening.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  While I enjoyed the darker aspects of life and war that the book didn’t shy away from, I could easily put it down at times. This is why it didn’t quite reach a 4-star rating for me.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I do recommend this book for those who enjoy mythology retellings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a good book that offers a fascinating exploration of Hindu mythology and culture, with compelling character development in Ganga’s POV. However, the pacing could be improved, and Bhishma’s perspective was less engaging. While it didn’t fully captivate me, I still recommend it to fans of mythology retellings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars"

            "I absolutely love Ganga. Her journey to understand what it means to be human and her interpretation of godhood is captivating. The relationships she shares with Shiva and Krishna are both complex and beautiful. However, I found Bhishma's character lacking depth. His scenes are brief until the very end, and I believe his final moments would have had a greater impact if we had seen more of him as an individual, rather than just Ganga’s son or a pawn of his empire. Additionally, I struggled with the influx of characters introduced not only at the beginning but also around the 40% mark when a new timeline began. The sheer number of names was overwhelming, and it took me until the end to fully grasp who was who.",

The Mahabharata, which I studied during my Masters' Program, fascinated me with its cultural implications and the community that inspired such a phenomenal work. Goddess of the River drew me in because it allowed me to dive back into that rich world. I appreciate how the novel highlights the fantastical nature of epic poems, which were originally oral and meant to be performed, singing of heroes, villains, morality, and responsibility.  \n\n- **Fantastical Elements and Mythology:**  \n  There’s a distinct difference between fantastical elements inspired by lore and mythology and those created purely for fantasy. This novel beautifully captures the essence of myth and lore from Hindu culture, which is why I loved it so much. The story of the River Goddess Ganga, her curse to become mortal, and her quest for freedom for herself and her son is both rich and compelling.  \n\n- **Emotional and Thematic Depth:**  \n  The novel is a beautiful, sometimes tragic, and emotional journey. It explores themes of freedom, responsibility, and the complexities of mortal life, all while staying true to its mythological roots.  \n\n- **Cultural Perspective and Representation:**  \n  I highly recommend this novel for its ability to present Hindu culture and mythology through a fresh lens.

I was initially unsure if it would capture my interest, but once I began reading, I was instantly captivated by the story. The narrative kept me eagerly turning pages, keen to discover the outcome of the adventures of Ganga, the river Goddess, and her son Bhishma.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and Character Development:**  \n  The seamless interweaving of Ganga and Bhishma's stories creates a compelling narrative that fully engages the reader. Typically, I am hesitant when books alternate between characters, as this often results in uneven character development. However, Patel excels in providing ample time and depth to both Ganga and Bhishma, ensuring that each character is well-explored and richly developed from their respective points of view.\n\n- **Complexity of Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The one aspect that slightly detracted from my experience was the complexity of the royal family tree. With numerous characters to keep track of, I found it challenging to remember their relationships and roles. Although an ancestry tree was provided at the beginning of the book to aid the reader, I still found it somewhat complicated.\n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Inspiration:**  \n  What I found particularly unique about this story is that, despite being a fictional fantasy, it is inspired by Hindu mythology, which influences thousands of people worldwide. I only discovered this through the author's notes at the end of the book, adding an enriching layer to the narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Goddess of the River* is a beautifully crafted story that I thoroughly enjoyed. I highly recommend it to fantasy book lovers, as Patel's talent for storytelling and her ability to bring mythological figures to life is truly remarkable.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her plight worsens with a cruel curse: she becomes mortal and must give birth to Vishnu to reclaim her true nature. The novel addresses profound themes, including child abandonment, and ultimately conveys a powerful message about a mother's resilience in the face of separation from her children. I was unexpectedly moved to tears by the end.",

Her misfortune is compounded by a cruel curse: she becomes mortal and must give birth to the Vashnu if she wants to reclaim her true nature. The novel tackles strong themes (TW: child abandonment) and ultimately delivers a powerful message about the resilience of a mother who cannot see her children. Surprisingly, I shed a few tears at the end.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  However, I struggled to progress through the book, as it had an almost soporific effect. There is very little action and very little rhythm, which made it hard for me to truly immerse myself in the story.  \n\n- **Temporal Structure:**  \n  I also found it difficult to follow the timeline of the chapters. The narrative alternates between several decades before the war and about fifteen years before the war, but everything remains very vague, and I couldn’t establish a clear chronology in my mind.  \n\n- **Clarity of Plot:**  \n  For most of the novel, I was unsure which war was being referred to, as there were no prior indications of a war. I thought things would improve with the onset of the war—after all, war usually implies action, right? But that wasn’t the case.  \n\n- **Memorability:**  \n  Even though I finished the book just two or three days ago, I can’t recall the details; everything feels a bit hazy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Goddess of the River* presents a touching story with strong themes and a powerful message, its slow pacing, unclear temporal structure, and lack of action made it difficult for me to fully engage with the narrative.

I want more from her voice and wouldn’t have minded more characterization of the Pandavas especially.  \n\n- **Thematic and Philosophical Exploration:**  \n  The book does a great job grappling with the thematic and philosophical elements of the original myth, which concern what it means to be a good person. Is it keeping your word even when you know there would be negative consequences? Or does the end justify the means? Patel adds an intersectional perspective, exploring how following the rules of society affects marginalized populations (women, people with disabilities, marginalized castes). Is it better to uphold the letter of the law or to fight against it?  \n\n- **Character Portrayal:**  \n  Patel does not shy away from portraying beloved characters when they make mistakes. I appreciate that.  \n\n- **Accessibility for New Readers:**  \n  The Mahabharata encompasses so much, and if you’re unfamiliar with the story, this is an excellent read. It introduces all the characters as well as the philosophical questions in a compact book.  \n\n- **Reader Satisfaction:**  \n  I won’t pretend I didn’t want a thousand more pages, but I think most readers will be very happy with the trade-off.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGoddess of the River is a compelling retelling of the Mahabharata from the perspectives of Ganga and Bhishma.

The pages slipped past my fingers, and the prose flowed like water, making it a captivating read.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Ganga, the Goddess of the River, was a lovely character—strong yet gentle. She faced incredibly difficult choices throughout the story, ones that no being, god or mortal, should ever have to make. Her portrayal was both compelling and emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Context:**  \n  As someone unfamiliar with the Mahabharata, I found the story initially confusing due to the multitude of names and characters. It took me a while to piece together the family tree, though I later discovered the author had provided one, which was immensely helpful. Familiarity with the Mahabharata would likely enhance the reading experience.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Vaishnavi Patel’s writing style is exceptional. The prose was fluid and poetic, contributing to the book’s overall beauty and making it a joy to read despite my initial confusion.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I greatly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others. However, I suggest keeping the family tree close at hand to fully appreciate the intricate relationships and characters.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Goddess of the River* is a beautifully written retelling of the Mahabharata, focusing on the Goddess Ganga. While the story can be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material, Patel’s exceptional prose and compelling characterization make it a rewarding read. A family tree is essential for navigating the complex relationships, but the effort is well worth it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel is divided into four parts, and I found three of them quite engaging. However, the third section felt disjointed and slowed the narrative, diminishing my investment in the story. The plot centers on the river Ganga, who is cursed to become mortal and bear immortal spirits as her children. To spare them from the pain of remembering their mortal lives, she drowns them at birth, but her husband intervenes to save the last child. As the boy grows up, he becomes embroiled in a battle for the crown, which is where the story lost its momentum for me.

It wasn't that Bishma was inherently uninteresting, but Ganga was SO riveting that I struggled to pull myself away.  \n  - I think other readers may also encounter this feeling, since the book feels strongly tied around the resolution of Ganga's plot lines.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a beautiful and enjoyable read, though my unfamiliarity with the Mahabharata posed a slight challenge. Vaishnavi Patel's captivating prose shines through, particularly in Ganga's chapters, which overshadowed Bishma's sections for me. Despite this, the novel is a strong and engaging work, and I eagerly anticipate Patel's future releases.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25 (rounded down to 4)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Author's Consistency and Growth:**  \n  I have read Vaishnavi Patel's first book, *Kaikeyi*, and had been eagerly waiting for this one. She did not disappoint at all. While the writing style in *Goddess of the River* is different from her debut, I loved it just as much.\n\n- **Adherence to the Retelling Promise:**  \n  The author promised a retelling of a side story from the epic *Mahabharata*, specifically focusing on the story of the River Goddess Ganga and her son Bhisma. She delivered exactly that—nothing more, nothing less. I appreciated that the narrative stayed true to this focus without delving into other side stories like Draupadi’s Swayamvar or Abhimanyu’s assassination.\n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Depth:**  \n  The story is told from the perspective of the River Goddess Ganga, exploring her origin, her curse, her pain, and her journey to understanding her true nature. It’s a profound exploration of how she became the Goddess we know and worship. The book highlights that Ganga was not a God until humans made her one, which adds a fascinating layer to her character.\n\n- **Emotional and Thematic Complexity:**  \n  Some readers might find the topic challenging, as Ganga, cursed and striving to free herself and her children, drowns her newborns. This aspect of the story is emotionally heavy but integral to the narrative.\n\n- **Anticipation for Physical Copy:**  \n  I can’t wait for the book to be published so I can add a beautiful hardcover to my bookshelf.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nVaishnavi Patel’s *Goddess of the River* is a compelling and faithful retelling of a lesser-known story from the *Mahabharata*. It offers a deep, emotional, and thought-provoking exploration of the River Goddess Ganga’s journey, staying true to its promise while delivering a unique narrative perspective.

The story begins with Ganga, who is the true starting point of everything, offering a fresh perspective on the epic.  \n\n- **Exploration of Moral and Ethical Ambiguities:**  \n  The book brings the moral and ethical ambiguities of the Mahabharata to the forefront, particularly through Ganga’s perspective. It highlights the contradictions of humanity, such as the tension between doing what is right and doing what is expected of you.  \n\n- **Feminist Lens:**  \n  The retelling introduces a feminist lens, which is often missing from traditional Hindu mythological texts that emphasize male-dominated ideals at the expense of women. This makes the story more compelling and relevant.  \n\n- **Character Perspectives:**  \n  The lyrical storytelling from the perspectives of both Ganga and Bhishma is engaging. While Bhishma’s constant righteousness can feel tiring at times, Ganga’s love for her son and her critique of his moral conundrums add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  I enjoyed *Kaikeyi* immensely, and this book is a close second in mythological retellings for me.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Final Copy:**  \n  I’m curious to see what changes, if any, are made in the final version of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nVaishnavi Patel’s retelling of the Mahabharata is a beautifully crafted and thought-provoking narrative that explores moral complexities and introduces a much-needed feminist perspective.

            "I have a deep appreciation for retellings, particularly those rooted in Hindu mythology, though I often approach them with a critical eye. Gangadevi's story is seldom explored, making this novel a fascinating and refreshing take. In contrast to *Kaikeyi*, which I found dull, this narrative was much more engaging. I particularly enjoyed the creative use of memories as a narrative device. However, the handling of the Amba/Shikandhi storyline felt inadequate; omitting the gender identity motivations central to their story in the Mahabharata seemed dismissive and left the narrative feeling incomplete. The first two parts of the book, especially Ganga’s time in the mortal realm, were excellent and formed a cohesive story. However, the second half felt disjointed and could have benefited from being shorter, as it lost focus on Ganga.",
            "The story placed excessive emphasis on Bhishma’s perspective, which overshadowed Ganga's narrative, particularly towards the end. While it’s difficult to convey Ganga’s story without Bhishma, the prolonged focus on him, especially in the Kurukshetra section, detracted from her journey."

Despite the dark themes, there’s a comforting tone to her storytelling.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book deals with heavy themes, including wartime violence, death, infanticide, and attempted sexual assault. However, these are handled in a way that feels integral to the story rather than gratuitous.\n\n- **Plot and Scope:**  \n  The story is epic and vast, spanning decades and exploring the lives of a wide range of characters, from commoners to royals. It follows the journey of a river goddess, from her creation through her curse and beyond a great war.\n\n- **Characterization (Women):**  \n  The portrayal of women—daughters, wives, and mothers—is particularly poignant. Their interactions with the river goddess, whether seeking aid, blessings, or simply using the waters, are compelling and central to the narrative. Vaishnavi’s ability to bring their stories into focus is a standout feature.\n\n- **Cultural Interpretation:**  \n  While some may not appreciate Vaishnavi’s take on Hindu epics, I found her interpretation enjoyable and would recommend the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully written, epic tale that balances dark themes with a comforting narrative style. Its focus on the lives of women and the journey of the river goddess is both compelling and thought-provoking. Despite its heavy content, the story leaves a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed Part One, particularly Ganga’s curse and her experiences as a mortal, which I felt could have been expanded into a complete story. However, the middle section dragged for me. While the political elements had potential, the focus shifted too much to Bhishma’s thoughts and feelings instead of advancing the plot, which was disappointing. The final part redeemed the story, with the war's conclusion and the touching reunion between Ganga and Bhishma being particularly satisfying.",
            "I adored Ganga but found Bhishma unappealing. I would have preferred to delve deeper into the lives of certain characters during Ganga’s mortal period, exploring the dynamics of their kingdom and relationships.",
            "This book felt reminiscent of many Greek mythology retellings, capturing a familiar vibe that I generally enjoy.",
            "This book fell short of my high expectations, likely influenced by my enjoyment of *Kaikeyi*, one of my favorite reads this year. I might have appreciated it more had I approached it with the mindset of a Greek mythology retelling, which it resembles, rather than anticipating a narrative similar to *Kaikeyi*."

Kaikeyi is one of my favorite reads this year, so I expected perhaps too much from this book. I likely would have enjoyed this more if I’d been expecting something akin to Greek mythology retellings, which it reminded me of, rather than something more like Kaikeyi.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I loved Part One. Ganga’s curse and her time as a mortal were fascinating to me, and I would have enjoyed that as the whole story, fleshed out more. However, I found the middle section a slog. The politics could have hooked me in if there was more focus on that, but it was more about Bhishma’s thoughts and feelings rather than actual plot, which was disappointing for me. The last part was good, though. The conclusion with the war and Ganga and Bhishma’s reunion was lovely to read.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I loved Ganga, but I didn’t care for Bhishma at all. I would have loved to have spent more time with certain characters during Ganga’s mortal period, learning how their kingdom worked and how different relationships functioned.\n\n- **Writing Style and Themes:**  \n  This read like a lot of Greek mythology retellings. The vibes were the same, and I generally enjoy those types of books.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was not a bad read, but I definitely wanted more from it. While certain parts were engaging and well-written, the pacing and focus on Bhishma’s internal monologue detracted from my enjoyment.

I loved the first part of this novel told completely from Ganga’s point of view.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I found the frequent time jumps in the later sections of the book to not be as effective as I would have liked.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  Goddess of the River tells the story of Ganga, a river goddess, and her son Bhishma throughout their lives as they navigate the messy world of mortals. The book touches on topics of justice, duty, family, and strength.  \n\n- **Cultural and Mythological Context:**  \n  I am not overly familiar with Hinduism or the Mahabharata, so I cannot speak to how this work relates to the original epic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found Goddess of the River to be a compelling and engaging read, particularly due to its strong character development and exploration of complex themes. While the narrative structure had some minor flaws, it did not detract significantly from my enjoyment. I highly recommend this book to fans of mythology retellings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars rounded up!"

It provided a much-needed piece of the Mahabharata, which felt like a blessing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The author did an excellent job of creating compelling and layered characters.  \n  - Bhisma, though frustrating at times, was a well-crafted character, and the trust in the author’s process paid off.  \n  - Krishna was one of the few male characters I liked, and I believe my general dislike for the other male characters was intentional.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Interactions:**  \n  - The conversations between characters were a highlight, particularly Ganga and Shiva’s dialogue at the end.  \n  - Bhisma’s realization of his mistakes tied everything together beautifully.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - I found it hard to have faith in a ruler who gambled away the entire kingdom, and I think the characters should have been more concerned about this.  \n  - The novel reinforced the modern realization that many male figures in great epics were deeply flawed, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite some frustrations, I had a great time reading this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offered a fresh and engaging take on the Mahabharata, with well-developed characters and meaningful dialogue.

            "The book shares a common issue with many feminist retellings of mythology: it centers on male characters while presenting the narrative through a female perspective. Ganga is a captivating character, and I thoroughly enjoyed Part 1, which focuses solely on her point of view. However, in Part 2 and beyond, the story shifts to include her son Bhishma's perspective for half the chapters, often using Ganga's sections as a framing device to explore other characters' stories.",

This is a beautifully written retelling that does a good job rooting you in the time and place of the Mahabharata and helping you understand the motivations and consequences of the actions of a LOT of different characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel tackles many complicated themes and lets the reader come to their own conclusions, which I appreciate.  \n\n- **Character Focus and Perspective:**  \n  The book suffers from the same problem as many other \"feminist retellings\" of mythology in that it's really a story about a lot of men but told from a woman's POV. Ganga was a super interesting character, and I really enjoyed Part 1 of the book (which was entirely about her and from her POV). However, starting in Part 2 (and through the end), her son Bhishma gets his own POV for half the chapters, and Ganga's chapters are frequently used as a framing device for telling other characters' stories.  \n\n- **Originality and Narrative Choices:**  \n  Overall, it’s a good read, but I personally would've liked to see less focus on the classic epic and more on creating a new story for this intriguing character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully written and thought-provoking retelling of the Mahabharata, with a strong focus on Ganga in the first part.

She transitioned into more of an observer, appearing only occasionally to share her thoughts on the experiences of other characters.",

This story made me eager to learn more about the Mahabharata.  \n\n- **Character Development (Ganga):**  \n  The first third of the novel had me completely hooked as we followed Goddess Ganga, a minor character in the original Hindu mythology whom Patel centers as the main character in *Goddess*. Patel's writing is lush and evocative, bringing Ganga to life and giving power to her voice. However, as the story progressed, I wished we could have seen more of her. Instead, she became more of an observer, someone we visited occasionally for her thoughts on the experiences of other characters.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  The novel excelled in exploring themes of duty, love, and the often harsh demands placed on women, even divine ones. Ganga's internal struggle between her sacred role and personal desires added depth to her character, making her both relatable and deeply complex.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Loyalty:**  \n  I will absolutely reread this book, and Patel is now an auto-buy author for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPatel's *Goddess* is a beautifully written and thought-provoking retelling that brings a minor mythological character to life.

The lack of clarity made it difficult to care about the conflict, and it left the main character seeming stupid, arrogant, and very unlikable.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  The latter part of the book became an infuriating slog due to the lack of focus on Ganga and the unrelatable motivations of the characters.

There’s something about it that is engaging and compelling, despite the more formal feel to the storytelling. Patel gives it a bit of an old epic flavor, which I appreciate.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are interesting, but they don’t always express themselves naturally. While I found them compelling, their dialogue and actions sometimes felt a bit stilted.  \n\n- **Themes and Moral Questions:**  \n  The heart of the story revolves around the question of oaths and whether you should keep them no matter what. I think the answer is obviously “no,” but the book explores a very different culture where that’s not so clear. People do heartbreaking and stupid things in the name of an oath, or *don’t* do things they should, like intervene when cruelty is being enacted on vulnerable people.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Justice:**  \n  The narration gives far more grace than I would to most of the men in the story. I don’t think I’m supposed to agree with their actions, but I felt that not enough people got their comeuppance.  \n\n- **Plot Elements:**  \n  I really enjoyed the political shenanigans and the interventions from the gods. These elements added depth and intrigue to the story, making up for some of the other shortcomings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book engaging and thought-provoking, especially in its exploration of cultural and moral dilemmas. While the characters and their expressions could feel unnatural at times, the themes and plot elements kept me invested.

The story effectively captures the beauty and hardships of motherhood, making it a compelling read for those interested in this theme.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga’s transformation from a river goddess to a human facing difficult decisions was profound and well-executed. However, the large number of characters made it challenging to form attachments to anyone besides Ganga.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story dragged a bit leading up to the war, with repetitive elements in the feud between the families. This made certain sections feel slow and less engaging.  \n\n- **Complexity and Focus:**  \n  The book demands significant time and focus, especially due to its intricate politics and family lines. While this complexity adds depth, it can also be overwhelming for readers who struggle to keep track of these details.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a well-written and immersive novel that explores profound themes like motherhood and sacrifice through the lens of Ganga’s transformation. While the large cast of characters and slow pacing in certain sections may pose challenges, the book is rewarding for readers willing to invest the necessary time and attention.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 🌟"

This was the only reason I couldn’t give the book a 4-star rating, as I felt it could have been even more captivating with a richer, more lyrical style.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would definitely recommend this book to readers who enjoy exploring profound themes within historical contexts. It’s a beautiful read that offers a fresh perspective on the story of Ganga and her impact on the mortal realm.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this novel to be a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of Ganga’s story and its ripple effects across time. Despite wishing for a more poetic writing style, I thoroughly enjoyed the themes and the way the author condensed such a vast epic into a manageable yet impactful narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 (implied by the inability to give a 4-star rating)"

It may also be that the original story itself was more entertaining than this one.  \n\n- **Character Complexity and Timeline:**  \n  One thing that was hard for me in this book was all the characters and keeping track of people and the jumping timelines.

Ganga, despite being in a stronger position and facing fewer trials, didn’t feel as central as I had hoped.  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The description led me to expect a strong focus on the mother-son relationship, similar to *Kaikeyi*. However, the relationship between Ganga and her son seemed to take a backseat to the war, which I didn’t find engaging.  \n- **Cultural and Mythological Context:**  \n  I appreciated that the story was based on a Hindu epic, which added a unique and culturally rich layer to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed certain aspects of the book, such as the focus on Ganga in the beginning and its connection to a Hindu epic, I felt the story didn’t fully deliver on its potential. The shift in character focus and the emphasis on the war over the mother-son relationship left me somewhat disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I flew through them with great interest.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story lost me when it switched to Bhishma’s point of view and introduced flashbacks of other characters’ stories through Ganga. This shift disrupted the flow and made it harder to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Complexity:**  \n  As a seasoned reader, I can usually handle complex character webs, but this book overwhelmed me. Despite the family tree provided at the beginning, I struggled to keep track of the numerous brothers, cousins, uncles, wives, gods, and their intricate relationships.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  This novel is a far cry from *Kaikeyi*, which I absolutely loved and still hold dear to my heart.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong, the narrative structure and overwhelming character complexity made it difficult to maintain my interest. It didn’t live up to my expectations, especially compared to the author’s previous work, *Kaikeyi*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The novel delves into profound topics like motherhood, war, morally ambiguous characters, and love. Notably, its portrayal of love is nuanced, flawed, and painful, mirroring real-life experiences. It transcends romantic love to encompass affection for a child, the world, or an idea, providing a refreshing contrast to the prevailing romantasy trend.",

It delves into the repercussions of Ganga's curse and Devavrata's oath, which ultimately culminate in a war that fractures their family. However, the middle section, with its frequent shifts between different points of view, disrupted the story's rhythm for me.",
            "Ganga’s perspective, particularly following her humanization, was compelling. Her internal conflict between her divine nature and human emotions enriched her character. Similarly, Devavrata’s journey, shaped by his mother’s curse and his oath, added intriguing layers to the narrative.",
            "With only a basic understanding of Hindu gods, I found Ganga’s story captivating and immersive. Although the pacing had its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am eager to explore more works by this author."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This reimagining of Ganga’s story offers a compelling exploration of her journey from goddess to mortal and back, with a focus on her internal struggles and the legacy she leaves behind. While the time jumps in the middle disrupted the flow, the novel’s rich characterization and emotional depth made it an engaging read. I look forward to reading more from this author.",

It was interesting to see my culture represented in this way.\n- **Story and Writing:** The story was compelling, and the writing was beautiful.\n- **Character Perspective:** I don’t believe that the son’s point of view added anything to the overall story.\n- **Comparison to Other Works:** While I LOVED *Kaikeyi*, this one just didn’t hit the same.\n- **Author’s Potential:** I’m hopeful for whatever this author writes in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I appreciated the use of South Indian mythology and found the story and writing compelling, the son’s perspective felt unnecessary, and the book didn’t resonate with me as strongly as *Kaikeyi*.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Mythological Context and Freshness:**  \n  I love any type of mythology but know so little about Hindu mythology, so Vaishnavi Patel's novel was a breath of fresh air in the midst of all the Roman/Greek myth retellings. Even as someone who knew next to nothing, I was still able to follow along and keep up.\n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  Patel's writing is beautiful. Every word and description was lush and so deliberate. I was captivated instantly. She was able to capture the voice of a Goddess while still making her not only easy to read but someone the audience could relate to.\n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n  I raced through the first part of the book. Unfortunately, once she expanded the point of view past Ganga, I felt like everything slowed too much. Writing from her son's perspective, who is in the human world, takes us back down to regular speed, but it disrupted the flow. I also felt like it took too much away from Ganga's story; with it being titled *Goddess of the River*, I was a little surprised to see the narrative divided as such. This pattern continued throughout—I had a noticeable difference in the speed of reading Ganga's chapters versus Devavrata's chapters and a noticeable difference in enjoyment of the chapters as well.\n\n- **Emotional Depth and Humanity:**  \n  Patel truly captured the beautiful, horrible humanity of everything. I look forward to reading more of her works in the future and do think this is a fantastic novel that any fan of mythology would enjoy!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Goddess of the River* is a gorgeous, expansive novel that offers a fresh take on Hindu mythology. While the narrative pacing and structure faltered slightly with the introduction of multiple perspectives, Patel's lush writing and emotional depth make this a compelling read for mythology enthusiasts.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I read the Mahabharata in high school but didn’t remember much about Ganga, so this was a fresh perspective for me.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  I enjoyed the author’s writing style, which I also loved in her previous book, *Kaikeyi*. She does a great job of telling a story that spans many years in a coherent and engaging way.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found Ganga to be a compelling character. Her portrayal was nuanced and kept me invested in her journey.  \n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  While I liked the plot, it didn’t resonate with me as strongly as *Kaikeyi* did. It was still enjoyable, but it didn’t hit the same emotional highs for me.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings and Sensitive Content:**  \n  There are multiple depictions of infant death, which were jarring and difficult to read, even though I’m not particularly sensitive to this topic. The author provides a helpful trigger warning at the beginning of the book, including specific page numbers to skip these chapters. I highly recommend skipping these passages if you’re sensitive to child death. While I understand the cultural context and the inclusion of this element from the original myth, it did affect my overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Cultural Context and Author’s Note:**  \n  I appreciated the cultural context provided at the beginning of the book, as well as the author’s note about trigger warnings. These additions made the story more accessible and thoughtful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I recommend *Goddess of the River* if you’re a fan of mythological retellings like me.

            "The book began with great promise, but ultimately, I cannot recommend it. Most conflicts could have been easily avoided by the gods and goddesses, and the inconsistent application of karma became frustrating as characters often justified their actions when it suited them. Additionally, the excessive manipulation from all sides detracted from the overall narrative.",
            "This story features many strong and intelligent female characters, which I appreciated. However, the persistent longing of mothers for their children—despite abandonment—felt repetitive and unrealistic. At some point, it would have been more sensible for these characters to move on. The male characters, on the other hand, were overwhelmingly unreasonable and unlikable. They were primarily responsible for the war, with many fathers exploiting their daughters for personal gain, yet none faced meaningful consequences for their actions, which was frustrating. The recurring theme of oaths only added to the chaos; for instance, the clever son of the river goddess refused to intervene in critical moments, despite knowing his actions could prevent the war. The king's reckless behavior, including gambling away his wife, siblings, and lands, was absurdly excused, and he was still portrayed as the perfect ruler. Additionally, the rightful heir to the throne was kept a secret, leading to unnecessary conflict and deaths, only for the truth to emerge after his demise. Overall, there wasn't a single male character to root for.",

The narrative explores her human experience and the consequences of her son's actions, which lead to war.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Source Material and Adaptation:**  \n  Patel takes an Indian Sanskrit epic and transforms it into an intriguing novel, much like her previous work, *Kaikeyi*. This time, she focuses on Ganga, the Goddess of the River, who is put under a spell and becomes human, giving birth to a son. The story follows her journey as a human and how her son's actions lead to war.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Patel's writing is as gorgeous as ever, showcasing her ability to craft vivid and compelling prose.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ganga's struggles to navigate the dichotomy between being a human and a God are compelling and well-portrayed. However, her son's struggles aren't as fleshed out as I would have liked, which detracted from the overall narrative.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The beginning of the book was more engaging than the end. While Ganga's journey was captivating, the narrative lost me in the second half, particularly as the focus shifted to her son's story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some pacing issues and underdeveloped aspects of the son's character, *Ganga* is a compelling read, especially for those interested in Patel's unique retellings of Indian epics. Ganga's internal struggles and Patel's beautiful writing make it worth the read, even if the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the beginning.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story begins with the river goddess Ganga's perspective, then shifts to alternate between her and her son, Devavrata. At times, I found the political intricacies challenging to follow due to the numerous characters, particularly among the nobility. A dramatis personae or family tree would have been a valuable addition for clarity.",
            "I found Ganga's chapters far more engaging than Devavrata's. Reading from Devavrata's perspective was often frustrating due to his flawed choices. In contrast, the author skillfully captures Ganga's maternal instincts, illustrating her compassion not only for Devavrata and her other children but also for humanity as a whole. This depth prevents her narrative from being merely about a mother bound to her son's fate.",
            "The author's emotive and gripping writing vividly captures the perspective of an immortal.",
            "The novel stirred deep emotions within me—outrage at the abuse endured by women and the pervasive societal prejudice, frustration with Devavrata's rigid binary perspective of right and wrong, and empathy for Ganga as she evolves from a distant goddess to a resilient, suffering mother."

        "conclusion": "The author's *GotR* is a richly written and emotionally charged novel that masterfully explores complex characters and societal issues. While I found Devavrata's perspective frustrating and the political intricacies challenging to navigate, Ganga's character development and the novel's emotional depth left a lasting impression. I highly recommend this author's work and look forward to more of their retellings.",

Devavrata's POV was frustrating to read due to his flawed choices throughout his life.\n- **Complexity of Plot:** I struggled with the politics of the story at times, given the multitude of characters introduced, especially within the nobility. A dramatis personae or family tree for reference would have been extremely helpful.\n- **Emotional Impact:** The novel evoked strong emotions in me—outrage over the abuse faced by women and the rampant prejudice in society, frustration over Devavrata's binary view of right and wrong, and empathy for Ganga's development from a distant goddess to a pained, steadfast mother.\n- **Character Development:** Patel skillfully portrays Ganga's maternal instincts for Devavrata and her other children, showing how her compassion grows to encompass humanity as a whole. This avoids reducing her narrative to simply being a mother tied to her son's fate.\n- **Overall Enjoyment:** Despite some challenges, I would not hesitate to pick up another of Patel's retellings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVaishnavi Patel's *GotR* is a richly written and emotionally charged novel that masterfully explores complex characters and societal issues. While I found Devavrata's perspective frustrating and the political intricacies challenging to navigate, Ganga's character development and the novel's emotional depth left a lasting impression. I highly recommend Patel's work and look forward to more of her retellings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\nNot a 5-star read due to my preference for Ganga's chapters over Devavrata's and the complexity of the plot, but still a highly impactful and enjoyable novel."

It highlights how both sides bend the rules to pursue what they believe is right, adding layers of moral complexity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Author’s Craftsmanship:**  \n  The book is a brilliant read, showcasing the author’s skill in storytelling, much like their first work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an engrossing and reflective retelling of the Mahabharata, offering a unique perspective through the eyes of Goddess Ganga.
