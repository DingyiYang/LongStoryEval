        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The story has started to heat up in Book 3 of *Eclipsed Evolution*. The world is now aware of the Neighbors' existence, and there’s growing tension about whether they can be trusted. The revelation that there’s more history between the Neighbors and Earth than previously known adds depth to the narrative. Even the Neighbors themselves are unaware of their own past, which creates intrigue. The plot takes a surprising turn as the true motives behind their visit to Earth are revealed, diverging from the initial claim of saving their dying planet.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Renee’s character evolves significantly as she is forced to confront her newfound ability to use the Neighbors’ magic. This development is a major turning point, as it carries severe consequences if discovered by either humans or Neighbors. Her internal struggle and the stakes involved add emotional weight to the story.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book maintains a fast-paced narrative, consistent with the first two installments. While the majority of the action takes place on Earth, there are brief interludes on the Neighbors’ world, setting the stage for more significant developments in the next book. The story balances predictable moments with satisfying and worrying twists, keeping the reader engaged.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The Neighbors’ society is hinted to have a corporate structure, which explains the underlying corruption. However, I’d like to see more exploration of their daily lives and societal functions in future books. The world-building is light but effective, making it accessible for readers new to sci-fi, especially those who lean toward fantasy.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The book continues to be light sci-fi with a fast-paced, engaging tone. It’s a great choice for readers who prefer fantasy but are dipping their toes into sci-fi. The inclusion of very light romance, without it being the focus, adds a subtle layer to the story without detracting from the main plot.\n\n- **Length and Accessibility:**  \n  At 192 pages, this installment is slightly longer than the first two but remains a quick and enjoyable read. Its length and pacing make it perfect for readers looking for a concise yet immersive experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBook 3 of *Eclipsed Evolution* builds on the foundation of the previous installments, delivering a mix of predictable, satisfying, and worrying moments. The plot thickens with revelations about the Neighbors’ true motives, and Renee’s character development adds depth to the story. While the world-building is still light, it sets the stage for more exploration in future books. The fast-paced, light sci-fi tone makes it an excellent choice for both new and seasoned readers of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While Renee, the main character, possesses noble qualities, some of her behaviors and reactions feel immature and less than endearing. I find myself uninterested in her potential romances with Jackson or August. It would be intriguing if Dr. Tayler turned out to be non-human, adding a twist where the Neighbors discover she is one of the species they previously invaded during their experiments. I'm also curious about Renee's origins—whether she is fully human or has a connection to Piers or the \"other\" species. Her abilities, such as using Mikhail’s spark to heal both herself and him, along with her strange memory of salty air and home, suggest there is more to her story.",

The author has been very creative in exploring what a first encounter with an alien species would involve.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  There are some people and aliens I would trust, while others I would not.
