The exploration of reincarnation, where relationships and roles recur throughout lives, was both captivating and skillfully portrayed.",

            "The story weaves together three timelines: an emperor and a lowly clerk, an innkeeper and a fox spirit, and an artist and his muse. While the shifting perspectives can be disorienting, the author manages them adeptly. The challenge of identifying the characters across these points of view enhances the reading experience. The open-ended conclusion is fitting for the narrative, though it may leave readers seeking more definitive resolutions feeling unsatisfied.",
            "For a debut novel, the writing is impressive. The author's clear style effectively navigates the complexity of three different lifetimes, making the story accessible. Additionally, the incorporation of minor cliffhangers in each chapter adds excitement and keeps the reader engaged.",
            "Although marketed as an epic romance, the love story ultimately feels flat, relying too much on fate and coincidences. The relationship is portrayed as destructive, obsessive, and tragic, generating an emotional rollercoaster. While this portrayal may not satisfy those longing for a fairytale ending, it aligns well with the story's tone."

It cleverly incorporates the term \"cut sleeve,\" a concept from Chinese history, which is also used in the narrative.\n- **Writing Style:** For a debut novel, the writing is well-crafted. Despite the complexity of three different lifetimes, the author’s style makes the story easy to follow. The use of minor cliffhangers in every chapter adds excitement and keeps the reader engaged.\n- **Plot Structure:** The story unfolds across three timelines: an emperor and a lowly clerk, an innkeeper and a fox spirit, and an artist and his muse. The shifting timelines can be confusing, but the author handles them skillfully. The guessing game of identifying who is who across the three POVs adds an intriguing layer to the reading experience.\n- **Romantic Elements:** While marketed as an epic romance, the love story feels somewhat flat, relying heavily on fate and coincidences. The love depicted is destructive, obsessive, and tragic, which creates an emotional rollercoaster. This type of love may not appeal to those seeking a fairytale ending, but it fits the story’s tone perfectly.\n- **Ending:** The ending is open to interpretation, which works well for the narrative but may not satisfy readers who prefer clear resolutions.\n- **Recommendation:** Highly recommended for those interested in an Asian reincarnation story with a tragic twist and multiple POVs. However, Danmei readers should approach it with an open mind, as it diverges from typical Danmei tropes despite the summary suggesting otherwise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a beautifully written debut that explores love across lifetimes in a tragic and emotionally charged manner. While the romance may not be conventional, the intricate plot, engaging writing style, and thought-provoking ending make it a compelling read. It’s a love-it-or-hate-it kind of story, but one that leaves a lasting impression.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5⭐️"

The narrative weaves through the complexities of love and politics, creating a rich tapestry where personal affairs feel intricately connected to the larger world. Spanning three timelines—2000 years ago, 300 years ago, and the present—the story highlights the cyclical nature of romance and the struggle to break free from entrenched patterns. While some questions remain unresolved, this openness invites readers to savor the journey rather than seek definitive answers, leaving ample room for further exploration.",

While the lack of Chinese characters in the text is a minor drawback, the emotional depth, engaging plot, and cultural richness make it a highly enjoyable read. The story’s open-ended nature hints at a potential sequel, leaving readers eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 4.5 stars  \n- Spice: 4/5  \n- Angst: 3/5"

Each narrative unfolds at a well-paced rhythm, interconnecting through recurring symbols and themes. This structure evokes comparisons to Michael Cunningham's *The Hours*.",

The stylized language and word choices authentically reflect their historical settings, while the seamless integration of magical realism adds a dreamlike quality to the narrative. However, the dialogue in the present-day chapters feels somewhat clunky in comparison to the fluidity of the historical sections. This is a minor critique that does not significantly detract from the overall experience.",

The concept of metaphysical recognition, where love is described as the soul remembering someone from a previous life, was thought-provoking and unique. It challenged me to reconsider how I view strangers, imagining they could be part of an epic romance spanning lifetimes.\n\n- **Realism and Complexity:**  \n  The story stood out for its realistic portrayal of love and relationships. It emphasized that not every lifetime is beautiful or romantic, and souls can be weathered and changed by circumstances. This added a layer of depth and complexity to the narrative, making it more relatable and grounded.\n\n- **Expectation Management:**  \n  I would advise readers not to approach this story with the expectation that a \"happily ever after\" is solely dependent on finding \"true love.\" The novel subverts traditional romantic tropes, offering a more nuanced and multifaceted perspective on love and destiny.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a refreshing and thought-provoking take on love, soul mates, and the concept of multiple lifetimes.

The story was compelling enough to keep me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n- **Handling of Multiple Time Periods:**  \n  Huang does a good job spanning three distinct time periods, making each feel unique. The present storyline felt like it was written by a different author compared to the 4 BC period, which added depth to the narrative. However, some time periods worked better than others. I enjoyed the present time period the most due to its purposeful storytelling and relatable characters. The 1742 period, which contained the most fantastical elements, was the least interesting to me, and I was surprised it was the period on which the novel ended.  \n\n- **Originality and Themes:**  \n  While the idea of love transcending generations isn’t original, Huang creates something fresh by blending Chinese folklore, fantasy, and gay literature. This unique combination sets the novel apart and makes it feel innovative.  \n\n- **Representation and Stereotypes:**  \n  Huang challenges stereotypes by portraying Asian men as strong and desirable, countering the discrimination they often face in the gay community. However, I wondered if the emphasis on physical perfection (e.g., bulging biceps, perfect pecs) in the characters perpetuates negative body image and exclusivity within the gay community.  \n\n- **Explicit Content:**  \n  The novel includes sex scenes, but they are not as explicit as those in works by authors like Sarah J. Maas or in the *Outlander* series. I believe the negative reactions to these scenes stem from discomfort with gay sex rather than their explicitness.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending felt unresolved, with major elements explained rather than fully fleshed out. I was disappointed by the lack of detail about the curse’s origins and its resolution. However, learning that this is intended to be a trilogy relieved some of my concerns, as I hope the subsequent books will provide a clear and satisfying conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this novel to be a captivating and innovative debut that blends diverse genres and challenges stereotypes.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  As a fan of danmei, xuanhuan, and western achillean historical fiction, this book quickly became my favorite read of the year so far. The characters were fascinating, the story heart-rending, and the world breathtaking.  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I must clarify that this is not a romance with a happily ever after (HEA). Personally, I found the ending satisfying and perfect for the story, though it may not suit readers expecting a traditional happy ending. The emotional quality was consistently potent and visceral, and the ending was one of my favorite parts.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n  The plots were juicy and riveting in different ways—the Emperor story, the huli jing story in the 1700s, and the modern LA one. The narrators' slow dissemination of meta-plot information kept me hooked throughout the book. The Emperor plot, seemingly inspired by the historical Emperor Ai, kept me guessing, especially with the inclusion of the famous \"cutsleeve\" incident.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Themes:**  \n  The chemistry between the leads was electric throughout the book, a necessity for a reincarnated lovers story. Their immediate connection in the Emperor plot left me curious about their shared lives across time. The surreality and inevitability of their love across lifetimes were heart-rending, especially as the overall plot unfolded.  \n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Nuances:**  \n  The choice to italicize all the Chinese dialogue was fascinating and poignant, serving as a reminder that the story is not rooted in the language it's being told in. This stylistic choice resonated deeply with me and even inspired me to seek out a Chinese copy of the book.  \n\n- **Market Context and Personal Experience:**  \n  Marketing romances without an HEA is challenging in the U.S. market, but knowing there wasn’t one increased my enjoyment of the story. As someone who appreciates romantic tragedies, I loved watching the fated romances play out across lifetimes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterful blend of captivating characters, intricate plots, and emotional depth. While it defies the traditional HEA expectation, its ending is deeply satisfying and fitting for the story. The cultural and linguistic nuances, combined with the powerful chemistry between the leads, make it a standout read. I eagerly await whatever the author writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5 or equivalent."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot Structure and Style:**  \n  The novel employs a unique blend of kishotenketsu, an East Asian story structure that avoids overt conflict, with episodic reveals. This approach creates a simmering plot that builds into a crescendo of transformation and realization, making the story resonate deeply. The narrative braids three distinct love stories—doomed, unlikely, or coincidental—into a cohesive and impactful whole.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each main character is distinct and well-crafted. The central mystery of identifying which individual belongs to the reincarnated pair of lovers keeps the reader engaged and guessing until the end. The question of whether fate will repeat itself or if the star-crossed lovers will overcome their challenges adds emotional depth and intrigue.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  The East Asian elements, particularly Chinese tropes and historical references, are seamlessly integrated into the narrative. They neither feel forced nor detract from the story, instead enriching it authentically. The novel avoids the pitfalls of exoticizing or mythologizing its cultural elements, presenting them as a natural part of the characters' world.\n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story begins in a contemporary, near-future setting at a WeHo gaysian circuit party, which sets the stage for the labyrinth of mysteries that follow. This modern backdrop contrasts effectively with the historical and fantastical elements, creating a dynamic and immersive atmosphere.\n\n- **Tone and Sensuality:**  \n  The novel strikes a balance between cute and mildly titillating, with most of its sensuality couched in euphemisms tied to each storyline. This approach makes it appealing to fans of romantasy, fantasy, and gay fiction without being overly explicit.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHuang’s debut is a masterful blend of fantasy, queer romance, and East Asian storytelling traditions. Its unique plot structure, well-developed characters, authentic cultural representation, and engaging tone make it a standout in its genre. While slightly messy in places, it ultimately delivers a resonant and satisfying reading experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFour and a half stars."

It features morally complex characters, nine-tailed foxes, and rich Chinese history, including nods to the cut sleeve emperor. The seamless integration of folklore and myth with a contemporary narrative creates a uniquely compelling experience.",

            "The blurb accurately describes this as a “romantic thriller,” a label I wholeheartedly agree with. I’m puzzled by those who categorize it as romantasy or erotica; it certainly didn’t come across that way to me. While there are some explicit scenes early on, they aren’t overly graphic, and I wouldn’t classify the book as erotica. Instead, the focus lies on emotional and historical depth, rather than on romance or fantasy tropes."

It bounces around between three very different time periods—modern day, the 1700s, and 4 BCE—and follows the men who are caught up together through reincarnation and their doomed efforts to break the cycle. The structure of weaving these timelines together was engaging and well-executed.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The blurb calls this a “romantic thriller,” and I think that’s a great description. I don’t understand why some people have labeled it as romantasy or erotica—it didn’t feel that way to me. While there is some explicit sex early in the book, it’s not overly graphic, and I wouldn’t classify this as erotica. The tone is more about the emotional and historical depth rather than being focused on romance or fantasy tropes.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  This book is sexy, queer, and brimming with Asian pride and love. It features morally grey characters, nine-tailed foxes, and Chinese history, including references to the cut sleeve emperor. The mix of Chinese history, folklore, and myth, alongside a present-day story, was incredibly compelling and unique.  \n\n- **Impact and Reflection:**  \n  I’m still thinking about this book after finishing it, which shows how much it sticks with you. The blend of history, myth, and modern storytelling left a lasting impression, and I absolutely loved it.  \n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  I’d give more warning about potential content involving consent and violence rather than explicit sexual content. The book handles mature themes thoughtfully, but readers should be aware of these elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a beautifully written, multi-layered novel that masterfully blends history, myth, and modern storytelling. It’s a romantic thriller with queer representation, Asian pride, and morally complex characters. Despite some misconceptions about its genre, it’s a deeply impactful read that stays with you long after finishing.

While the oldest timeline shapes the lovers' future, the pivotal events that set the story in motion occur offscreen. Experiencing the full rise and fall of that situation in real time would have elevated the book to 4.5 stars. Additionally, the middle timeline concludes abruptly, though the imaginative sex scenes—such as those featuring a nine-tailed flying fox spirit—partially compensate for this.",
            "The characters are captivating, particularly in the first and last timelines. They are complex, flawed, and filled with doubt and desire, which lends them authenticity. While I didn't dislike the middle timeline, it left me with more unanswered questions and felt somewhat disconnected from the others.",
            "The language is often ornate, especially in the ancient imperial China timeline, where the narrator refers to his penis as his “influence.” This stylistic choice effectively distinguishes the timelines and resonated with me, though it may take some getting used to initially.",
            "The author's vivid portrayal of imperial China is impressive, but I particularly enjoyed the present-day scenes, like the circuit parties and the Songkran water festival in Thailand. The attention to detail highlights a vibrant queer community that celebrates life rather than merely coping with homophobia.",
            "The marketing and reviews are split on whether this story qualifies as a romance or romantasy. Strictly speaking, I would argue it doesn't fit the definition of a capital-R Romance, as the lovers do not attain a traditional happily-ever-after in each lifetime. Instead, it explores the profound connection between two souls drawn to each other across time, encompassing genuine love, tenderness, anger, and betrayal. The tone strikes a balance between hope and tragedy, featuring grand gestures and emotional depth.",
            "I give this a 4-star rating. Despite some debut-author roughness and a conclusion that could be stronger, the story is refreshingly unique and engaging. The characters are richly developed and complex, adding to their authenticity."

While it has some debut-author roughness and a conclusion that could have been stronger, the story feels distinctively fresh and compelling. The characters are richly drawn and messy, making them feel very real.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  Marketing and reviews are divided on whether this is a romance/romantasy. By a strict genre definition, I’d argue it’s not a capital-R Romance, as the lovers don’t achieve a traditional happily-ever-after in each lifetime. Instead, it’s a story about two lovers drawn to each other across lifetimes, filled with real love, tenderness, anger, and betrayal. The tone is hopeful yet tragic, with grand gestures and emotional depth.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are fascinating, especially in the first and last timelines. They are well-drawn, messy, and full of doubt and desire, which makes them feel authentic. The middle timeline, while not disliked, left me with more unanswered questions and felt slightly disconnected from the others.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The vivid writing about imperial China is impressive, but my favorite settings were the present-day scenes, such as circuit parties and the Songkran water festival in Thailand. The author has a keen eye for detail and portrays a vibrant queer community focused on celebration rather than just navigating homophobia.\n\n- **Sex Scenes:**  \n  The sex scenes may be a make-or-break element for some readers. Personally, I found them great—they are a matter-of-fact part of the characters’ lives and contribute to the romantic tension. However, readers who prefer romantic leads to only have sex with each other may find this aspect challenging, as the characters engage in casual/social sex with others.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The language is often flowery, particularly in the ancient imperial China timeline, where the narrator refers to his penis as his “influence.” This stylistic choice helps differentiate the timelines and worked well for me, though it may require some adjustment at the start.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The main issue for me was the narrative structure, which made the ending feel a bit rushed. The oldest timeline shapes the lovers’ future lives, but the exact events that set the story in motion happen offscreen. Seeing the full rise and fall of that situation in real time would have elevated the book to 4.5 stars for me. The middle timeline also ends more abruptly, though the imaginative sex scenes (e.g., involving a nine-tailed flying fox spirit) somewhat compensate for this.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  Moderate content warnings apply, including dubious consent around sex and drug use, as well as compulsion/forgetting magic used in an attempted-but-stopped sexual coercion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a richly drawn, compelling book with real and messy characters. While there are occasional pieces of stiff dialogue and the story could have benefited from 30-50 more pages to fully develop certain elements, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s a delight to read an m/m story by a queer Asian man, offering a fresh perspective compared to previous works I’ve loved.

            "The novel intricately intertwines seemingly unrelated timelines, linking two men across lifetimes. Spanning from ancient palaces to modern underground raves, their love faces relentless trials, transcending time yet threatening to consume them. Initially, I expected a straightforward tale of a palace servant seducing his emperor, but I was pleasantly surprised by the multiple timelines and the profound exploration of fate and love.",
            "There’s been considerable debate about categorizing this book as erotica due to its explicit scenes, but I disagree. While it does contain frequent sexual content—especially three steamy scenes in quick succession at the beginning—these moments serve a clear purpose within the plot and character dynamics. The sex is not merely for titillation; it functions as a narrative tool and is even weaponized at times. Additionally, I believe queer sexual content is often scrutinized more harshly, and this book effectively challenges those biases.",
            "The author's use of euphemisms and metaphors for sexual content felt excessive. Phrases like \"my influence\" and \"his pink plum\" seemed unnecessary and distracting. I would have preferred more direct language, as it would have made the scenes feel more authentic and less contrived.",
            "Although marketed as a romance or romantasy, the book diverges from strict genre conventions. While it is undeniably romantic, it reads more like a cautionary tale influenced by folktales. My investment in the characters' relationship took a backseat, as the narrative focuses more on the power and consequences of their love than on delivering a traditional romance.",
            "While I had a slight issue with the writing style, the book was an enthralling experience that kept me engaged and guessing at every turn. It offers a unique and thought-provoking perspective that I highly recommend. Additionally, it makes a valuable contribution to the queer romantasy genre, standing out amidst the many SJM and Fourth Wing-inspired titles currently saturating the market."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a beautifully complex exploration of love, fate, and the consequences of transcending time.

I initially thought the story would focus solely on a palace servant seducing his emperor, but it surprised me with its multiple timelines and deeper exploration of fate and love.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  While marketed as romance or romantasy, the book doesn’t strictly adhere to genre conventions. It’s undeniably romantic but feels more like a cautionary tale inspired by folktales.

However, I disagree with this take. While the book does feature frequent sexual content (including three smutty scenes back-to-back at the start), these moments feel purposeful and tied to the plot and character dynamics. The sex isn’t just there to be sexy; it’s used as a narrative tool, even weaponized at times.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel weaves together three timelines—4 BCE, 1740, and present-day LA—through the lives of flawed men whose souls collide across lifetimes. The story is driven by engaging POVs and infused with the nine-tailed fox tale, creating an alluring and immersive world. The slow pacing, especially in the first half, demands patience but enhances the depth of character connections. The ending is well-done, though some questions remain unresolved.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are deeply flawed yet compelling, with their lives tied to the turns of fate. Their journeys of self-discovery are fueled by ambition, devotion, and unsaid feelings. The portrayal of queer love, including the bold exploration of the 'cut sleeve' concept, adds complexity and authenticity to their relationships.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The novel excels in blending historical and fantastical elements, with rich depictions of Chinese culture and history, including court drama, medicine, artifacts, the Han dynasty, and iconic Chinese poems. The settings across different timelines are vividly rendered, transporting readers seamlessly through each era.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is captivating and immersive, easily drawing readers into the story. The author’s ability to balance humor, romance, and twists makes for a fun and engaging reading experience.\n\n- **Themes:**  \n  Central themes include true love, fate, self-discovery, and the enduring nature of connections across lifetimes. The novel also explores ambition, betrayal, and the complexities of human emotions.\n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  The book offers a genre-bending experience, blending historical drama, fantasy, and romance. While the slow pacing and abundance of sex scenes may not appeal to all readers, the immersive storytelling and cultural richness make it a rewarding read. A buddy read is recommended to fully appreciate the layered narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTHE EMPEROR AND THE ENDLESS PALACE is a captivating and ambitious debut that blends history, fantasy, and romance into a queer love story about fate and self-discovery. With its rich cultural elements, flawed yet compelling characters, and immersive prose, it offers a unique and engaging reading experience. While the pacing and explicit scenes may not suit everyone, the novel’s depth and twists make it a memorable journey.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5 stars"

            "The author’s debut novel is a lush, erotic fantasy that intertwines three timelines over two millennia. It follows six men: Dong Xian and Emperor Ai of Han in 4 BCE, He Shican and Jiulang in 1740, and River and Joey in 2023. Despite the intricate timelines, the narrative is both accessible and engaging. The author adeptly reveals the connections between these eras while crafting three tender, sensual romances.",
            "The protagonists are well-developed, with their romances evolving across generations. However, side characters like Calvin (River’s Grindr hookup) and Garden (River’s sister) feel underexplored. While Garden has intriguing moments, both characters are largely limited to their roles as Unrequited Lover and Protective Sibling, leaving me wanting more depth. The romance is intensely spicy, featuring a level of sensuality that might make reading in public awkward. Playful sexual innuendo adds humor, but readers should be mindful of significant trigger warnings for sexual assault and violence. The novel leans more toward erotica than romantic fantasy, yet it remains emotionally engaging and inspiring.",
            "The novel delves into themes of love, loss, reincarnation, and the balance between fate and free will. I was particularly drawn to the recurring romantic patterns throughout the timelines, which raised intriguing questions about destiny and choice. The amnesia romance aspect, especially in River and Joey's story, was beautifully crafted and added significant emotional depth."

While the side characters could have been more fleshed out, the protagonists’ romances are deeply compelling, and the exploration of fate versus free will adds intellectual depth. The novel’s erotic elements are both fun and intense, making it a memorable read despite its darker themes.",

While the first half is slower, focusing on world-building and character development, the second half accelerates with unexpected twists and turns. The book balances serious themes with humorous moments, though the emotional depth between characters occasionally takes a backseat to other elements. Overall, it’s an entertaining and enjoyable read, especially for those who appreciate surprises and a mix of romance and humor.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author, Justinian, explores the darker, lust-filled aspects of love, which I found compelling and beautifully portrayed.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Justinian’s prose is stunning, and I found myself repeatedly marking certain phrases because they were so beautifully written. The author’s ability to craft such evocative language was a highlight for me.  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The story is told across three timelines, which can be confusing at first.

Despite my usual aversion to explicit content, I felt the author handled it with grace and purpose.  \n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I ended up loving the book, even though I was initially unsure about it.

Huang’s charismatic online presence, including his bold and unapologetically gay persona, intrigued me enough to pick up the book. His playful warning to “Gird your loins!” and description of the novel as “spicy” set the tone for what was to come.\n\n- **Genre and Structure:**  \n  The novel blends romance, fantasy, and thriller elements, though the thriller aspect feels the least prominent.

The exploration of queer love and desire across different eras and cultures was both bold and engaging.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Huang’s writing is unapologetically explicit and playful, with a sense of bravado that shines through. The novel opens with steamy man-on-man action in each timeline, and the 4 BC storyline, inspired by a real-life romance, is particularly vivid. While some euphemisms elicited a chuckle (e.g., “pounded his pink plum until it was quivering”), the explicitness is consistent and unflinching.\n\n- **Entertainment Value and Critique:**  \n  The novel was a lot of fun and highly entertaining, though it occasionally veered into cheesy territory—a trait I associate with the romance genre.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This book is a sex-soaked queer speculative novel that spans three timelines: 6 BCE, 1740, and the modern day. It weaves modern Asian American gay lives with homosexual tales from Chinese history and literature, creating a campy, lusty, and enthralling narrative of cyclical reincarnation. It challenges traditional soulmates narratives and explores themes of love, obsession, and breaking cycles.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The connections and repetitious details between the three storylines are fascinating to trace. There’s a reveal about halfway through that, while predictable, is well executed. The ending subverts and challenges the traditional soulmates narrative, leaving readers to ponder whether the characters are beloved soulmates or eternally cursed to torture each other.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Some of the language used, especially in describing sex, is awkward and jarring at first, but once you settle into it, it becomes fun and engaging. The book defies easy categorization, making it difficult to pitch to the right readers, but its uniqueness is part of its charm.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters grapple with profound questions about love and destiny. Lines like, “I've felt directionless my whole life, and yes, this is an unusual direction to be going, chasing after some guy who may or may not be my literal soulmate—but it feels good. It feels true,” highlight their emotional depth and internal conflicts.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes sensitive topics such as sexual assault and rape, violent assault, infidelity, drugging, bad drug trips, memory alteration and gaslighting, ableism, past death of a parent (cancer), and animal death.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a bold, unconventional exploration of love, destiny, and reincarnation. While its explicit content and challenging themes may not appeal to everyone, its unique structure, thought-provoking questions, and campy tone make it a memorable read. I quite liked it, despite its flaws, and appreciated how it subverted traditional narratives.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "Some characters truly shone, particularly Calvin, who deserved his own story and a happy ending. However, other characters and their dynamics often left me confused, especially regarding the reincarnation pattern. The romance felt toxic, and I struggled to grasp the idea of recognizing past loves, as the initial love story lacked depth. By the end, I felt the characters should have parted ways for good.",

            "I appreciated the book's unapologetic embrace of queer and Asian identities. It doesn't coddle the reader; instead, it invites you to explore concepts like circuit parties and Han dynasty history on your own, enhancing its authenticity.",

It didn’t hold the reader’s hand, which I appreciated. If you don’t know about circuit parties or Han dynasty history, you’re expected to figure it out yourself, which added to the authenticity.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Some of the characters truly sparkled on the page. Calvin, in particular, stood out to me—he deserved his own story and a happily ever after. However, other characters and their dynamics left me confused at times, especially when trying to figure out the reincarnation pattern.\n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**  \n  The fantasy elements were fun and well-integrated into the story. I always enjoy when magic is woven into the regular world, and it was refreshing that characters didn’t overreact to its presence.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance, unfortunately, felt incredibly toxic to me. I struggled to understand the concept of recognizing past loves, especially since the initial love story didn’t feel as deeply developed as it could have been. By the end, I felt the characters should have parted ways for good.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I appreciated how Huang’s language during the sex scenes shifted to reflect each era. It added a layer of depth and creativity to the narrative.\n\n- **Audiobook Performance:**  \n  The narrators did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. They infused the right amount of action and passion into their performance, making the audiobook experience enjoyable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had moments I adored, particularly its bold representation and the fantasy elements. However, the toxic romance and some confusing character dynamics detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The interwoven timelines were effectively executed, maintaining my interest throughout without the urge to skip any chapters. Each timeline unveiled essential information that contributed to the overall narrative. However, I found the origins and mechanics of the initial curse unclear; a few additional chapters in the first timeline could have provided much-needed clarification. I appreciated the ending, where River prioritized himself and broke free from a painful cycle. Although it wasn't the romantic choice, it felt both brave and satisfying.",
            "Dong Xian’s character felt inconsistent; his initial promiscuity, introduced in the opening chapter, faded later on, making him seem out of character. Without that first chapter, I wouldn't have viewed him as a “player.” His relationship with JunJun was predictable, and I found it difficult to root for them. However, it was refreshing to read a gay fantasy by a gay author. The sex scenes were well-balanced, and the writing kept me engaged throughout.",
            "I wasn't familiar with the historical context of Emperor Ai, and my research didn't clarify the curse either. The story would have benefited from providing more context.",
            "I enjoyed the book, but the marketing seems misleading. It's promoted as a romance fantasy, yet it leans more towards tragedy than romance, which may confuse readers anticipating a conventional love story."

Despite some inconsistencies in characterization and confusion about the curse, the cleverly written reincarnation aspect and the brave, unexpected ending made it a memorable read.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Marketing:**  \n  I enjoyed the book, but the marketing feels off. It’s marketed as a Romantsy, but it’s more of a tragedy than a romance, which might mislead readers expecting a traditional love story.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Timelines:**  \n  The timelines were interwoven well, and I didn’t feel the urge to skip any chapters. Each timeline revealed crucial information, helping piece together the story. However, I was confused about the initial curse—its origin and mechanics weren’t fully explained. A couple more chapters in the first timeline could have clarified this better.  \n\n- **Historical Context:**  \n  I wasn’t familiar with the historical aspect of Emperor Ai, and while I looked it up, it didn’t help explain the curse. More context within the story would have been beneficial.  \n\n- **Characterization (Dong Xian):**  \n  Dong Xian’s character felt inconsistent. His promiscuity, introduced in the opening chapter, wasn’t reflected later, making it seem out of character. Without that first chapter, I wouldn’t have seen him as a “player.” His relationship with JunJun was predictable, though not something I rooted for.  \n\n- **Reincarnation Aspect:**  \n  The synopsis doesn’t mention that three characters are reincarnated, which makes the story feel less romantic. However, I found the reincarnation aspect fun and cleverly written, with an unexpected ending.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I appreciated the ending, where River chose himself and walked away from a painful cycle. It wasn’t the romantic choice, but it was brave and satisfying.  \n\n- **Representation and Writing Style:**  \n  It was refreshing to read a gay fantasy written by a gay author. The sex scenes weren’t overdone, and the writing kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book and couldn’t put it down.

            "I was captivated to discover that the previous two time periods were narrated from modern-day Joey's perspective rather than River's, as I had initially thought. This twist added depth and intrigue to the story. I appreciate that it deviated from a traditional happily-ever-after, as the author notes on their website. The ending left me satisfied, especially if this is intended as a standalone, though it certainly sets the stage for a sequel. Each chapter set in the 1740s kept me on edge, with the author's skillful suspense shining through. I was also impressed by the modern sections, which seamlessly integrated pop culture and reflective dialogue. The most thrilling aspect was piecing together how the three time periods interconnected, which was truly mind-blowing.",
            "My favorite reincarnation story is set in 1740, featuring He Shican, Dr. Qi Yewang, and the fox spirit. The complex and ambiguous relationship between Jujun/Yewang/Winston and Dong Xian/He Shican/Joey adds significant depth to the narrative. I was particularly moved by the Emperor/Jianglu/River's enduring anger and sadness, which culminates in Joey's Remembrance in the modern day and River's forgetfulness.",

            "While I appreciated the unique storytelling, I found the sex marathon at the 80% mark quite overwhelming. It felt as though every couple across lifetimes was ovulating simultaneously, resulting in parallel sex scenes that mirrored one another. The ending took me by surprise; I anticipated a climactic moment where the characters could finally unite, but instead, it offered a new perspective that made me align with River. I ultimately stopped rooting for these \"soulmates\" to be together—if they can't reconcile after 2,000 years, perhaps it's time to let go. \n\nAdditionally, I felt unsatisfied with the resolution regarding the heirloom seal. I never grasped how it would break the curse or how the curse originated. It was present in front of Joey and River multiple times, so why couldn't Joey simply take it to mend their relationship? What else needed to happen for the curse to lift? While River's decision to walk away was understandable, the missed opportunity to use the heirloom when it was readily available left me confused.",
            "I found River and much of the present-day storyline less engaging, as he felt less interesting compared to the other characters. However, the 4BCE narrative truly carried the book for me, and I particularly enjoyed the 1750s storyline, especially the intriguing nine-tailed fox element.",
            "The sex scenes set in 4 BCE were refreshingly unique, with jaw-dropping word choices that vividly evoked the era. Phrases like “bejeweled droplets” to describe explosive cum were particularly striking. I appreciated the colorful language, which stood in stark contrast to modern romance novels that often rely on repetitive terminology.",
            "I appreciated that the emperor was inspired by a real historical figure, with key details—his name, his queerness, the names of his lover and the queen dowager, the dynasty, and the year—retained. I'm intrigued by the overall accuracy of the story."

I’m curious about how accurate the story is overall.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  I didn’t really like River or most of the present-day story. He seemed much less interesting than the other characters. However, the 4BCE story carried the whole book for me. I also enjoyed the 1750s story, especially the nine-tailed fox aspect.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Language:**  \n  The sex scenes set in 4BCE were refreshing in a way. The word choice was jaw-dropping and clearly reminiscent of those times. Descriptions like “bejeweled droplets” for explosive cum blew my mind. I loved the colorful language and how different it was from modern romance novels, which often use the same words repeatedly.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  While I appreciated the unique storytelling, I found it painful to listen to the sex marathon at the 80% mark.

I ended up not rooting for these two “soulmates” to be together. If they can’t make up after 2000 years, maybe they should just call it.  \n\n- **Unresolved Plot Points:**  \n  I felt like I got no closure on the heirloom seal. I never understood how it would break the curse or how the curse started in the first place. It was in front of Joey and River multiple times, so why couldn’t Joey just grab it and mend things between them? What else had to occur for the curse to break? River’s decision to walk away was understandable, but I don’t understand why the heirloom couldn’t be used when it was right there.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book, especially the 4BCE story, which was captivating and well-written.

It features star-crossed lovers destined to meet across multiple lifetimes, a trope I’ve been craving, especially in a queer context. The idea of fate tethering two souls together, with their love transcending time, is poetic, beautiful, and bold. The synopsis promises an exploration of undying love that transcends lifetimes, which is deeply appealing.\n\n- **Execution of the Soulmate Trope:**  \n  Unfortunately, the book did not deliver on the soulmate trope as expected. Instead of a gradual realization of deep, destined love, the relationship is portrayed as an instant, lustful, and unfaithful infatuation. The main character, Dong Xian, is described as self-serving and driven by sexual impulses, which undermines the romantic depth promised by the premise. His inability to remain faithful, despite declarations of eternal love, makes it hard to believe in the characters’ destined connection.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The plot lacks depth and resolution. The mystery surrounding the curse and the inexplicable meetings across lifetimes is never fully explored or explained, leading to a bland and unsatisfactory ending. The potential for a compelling narrative is there, but it ultimately falls flat.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing is a saving grace of the book. The author uses distinct voices, dialogues, and narrations that are appropriate for each time period, adding authenticity to the story. The interweaving of the historical origin of the “cut-sleeve” emperor and his love for Dong Xian is particularly well-done. The cut-sleeve scene stands out as one of the few moments where the romance feels genuine and touching.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters, particularly Dong Xian, are flawed in ways that detract from the story. His promiscuity and infidelity make it difficult to root for him or believe in his romantic declarations. While I don’t intend to slut-shame, his actions, especially cheating, are revolting and undermine the emotional core of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a captivating premise and strong writing, it fails to deliver on the promise of a deep, destined love across lifetimes. The characters’ actions and the unresolved plot elements leave much to be desired. However, the writing style and historical interweaving add some redeeming qualities to the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Overall: 3.5 stars (rounded up)  \n- Plotline and Characters: 2.5 stars  \n- Writing: Extra 1 star (and appreciation for the pretty cover)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Ending:**  \n  I almost gave this 3 stars because the ending frustrated me. I was so upset that I went back and listened to the last two chapters on the audiobook again to understand what happened. Even after revisiting it, I was still annoyed.  \n- **Story Concept:**  \n  The story concept is fantastic. It weaves together the lives of people in 4 BCE in an endless palace, an inn in 1740, and present-day Los Angeles. I was completely engrossed in figuring out how all the characters were connected, which kept me hooked.  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book is labeled as a Romantasy, but it also feels like historical fiction. It’s an MM love story with a lot of explicit content. If you’re not a fan of heavy spice, this might not be for you.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story concept and intricate connections between characters were captivating, the ending left me deeply frustrated. Despite this, the blend of romance, fantasy, and historical elements made for an engaging read, though the explicit content may not appeal to everyone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nAlmost gave it 3 stars due to the disappointing ending."

It’s one of the few books I’ve read that effectively uses the first-person present tense, which added to its unique appeal.  \n\n- **Dialogue:**  \n  While the modern timeline was engaging, some of the dialogue felt clunky and archaic, which stood out and disrupted the flow at times.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt rushed and sudden, with the final sequence appearing sparse and limp compared to the richly detailed and immersive rest of the book.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  The lush settings and vivid descriptions, the unflinching exploration of the intersection of sex and romance, and the clever interweaving of timelines made this book truly stand out. Its ability to achieve so much as a shorter novel was particularly impressive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor drawbacks, such as clunky dialogue in the modern timeline and a rushed ending, this book was a standout read.

However, their relationship is overshadowed by a betrayal from their past, which lingers throughout the narrative. The side characters, including the Emperor’s grandmother, his cousin and protector, and Calvin in the present day, enrich the story with depth and complexity.",

I especially appreciated the forest in the 1740 timeline, which beautifully complemented the fox spirit mythology, as well as the intrigue of the ancient Chinese palace. The present-day LA backdrop resonated with me, as I recognized familiar landmarks.",

Although the ending is painful, it feels appropriate, implying that these lifetimes may be more about cleansing than attaining eternal happiness. I developed a strong emotional connection to the characters, but the emphasis on the love story ultimately felt a bit overwhelming.",

The premise of two men bound to seek each other across lifetimes intrigued me, and I’m glad I read it, though I’m not sure the genre is for me.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The novel spans three timelines, expertly woven together with seamless transitions despite significant time jumps. The story unfolds in a straightforward manner, focusing on the tragic, intense love between two souls. However, the first two-thirds felt slow, with each timeline building gradually, and the frequent switches made it feel like the story was moving faster than it actually was.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The two central characters are imperfect, and their love is intense, desperate, and flawed. I was drawn into their love story, especially their softer, intimate moments. However, their relationship is shadowed by betrayal from their first lifetime, which felt like a constant presence throughout the book. The side characters, like the Emperor’s grandmother, his cousin/protector, and Calvin in the present day, added depth and complexity to the story.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The settings across the three timelines—ancient China, 1740, and present-day LA—were lush and immersive. I particularly enjoyed the forest in the 1740 timeline, which complemented the fox spirit mythology, and the manipulations in the ancient Chinese palace. The present-day LA setting resonated with me, as I recognized familiar landmarks.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel explores themes of reincarnation, tragic love, and the struggle to let go. The ending, while painful, felt fitting, suggesting that these lifetimes might be about cleansing rather than achieving eternal happiness. I felt a deep emotional connection to the characters, but the focus on the love story was ultimately a bit overwhelming for me.\n\n- **Fantastical Elements and Mythology:**  \n  The inclusion of fox spirits and magical elements added a fascinating layer to the story. I enjoyed how these fantastical elements were woven into the narrative, though they occasionally felt terrifying.\n\n- **Reader Experience and Satisfaction:**  \n  While I enjoyed the characters, settings, and fantastical elements, I was left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction. The story’s tragic nature and the slow pacing in the first two-thirds detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The book unfolds across three timelines—4 BCE, 1740, and the present day—with the 1740 timeline being my favorite. However, the timelines don't intersect as much as anticipated, and the reincarnation concept feels underdeveloped. The narratives could stand on their own without the reincarnation element, as it lacks the depth needed to be convincing. Furthermore, some plot points are introduced and then abruptly dropped, which can be disorienting for the reader.",
            "The writing possesses a feverish, florid quality that, while not to my taste, effectively captures the folk tale vibe. The tongue-in-cheek use of purple prose, particularly the fruit references, adds a charming touch. However, the overall style can be overwhelming at times, and the broader concept of reincarnation left me feeling indifferent.",
            "The theme of love as a recognition linked to reincarnation didn't resonate with me, making it difficult to connect with the characters' love story on a deeper level and affecting my overall enjoyment. However, the book's exploration of love, loss, and the search for meaning is compelling in its own right.",
            "The marketing of this book as a romantasy is misleading; it reads more like a remixed folk tale infused with elements of historical c-drama and surrealism. While it delves into themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery, it doesn't adhere to the conventional narratives of falling in love or promise a happily-ever-after. Romance readers may find this disappointing, but as a folk tale, it truly excels."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Marketing:**  \n  The marketing of this book as a romantasy is misleading. It’s more of a remixed folk tale with elements of historical c-drama and surrealism. While it explores themes of love, heartbreak, and searching, it doesn’t focus on the traditional \"hows and whys\" of falling in love, nor does it guarantee a happily-ever-after (HEA). Romance readers might be disappointed, but as a folk tale, it succeeds.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The book follows three timelines (4BCE, 1740, and present day), with the 1740 timeline being my favorite. However, the timelines don’t intersect as much as expected, and the reincarnation concept feels underdeveloped. The stories could have worked without the incarnations, as they lack the necessary weight to make the concept convincing. Additionally, the plot events are sometimes dropped abruptly, which can be disorienting.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing has a feverish, florid quality that isn’t my favorite, though it suits the folk tale vibe. The tongue-in-cheek use of purple prose, especially the fruit references, is amusing and adds charm. However, the overall writing can feel overwhelming at times, and the macro reincarnation concept left me indifferent.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The theme of \"love as a feeling of recognition\" tied to reincarnation didn’t resonate with me. I struggled to connect with the characters’ love story on a deeper level, which impacted my overall enjoyment. Despite this, the book’s exploration of love, loss, and searching is compelling in its own way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s marketing as a romance may mislead readers, it shines as a remixed folk tale with historical and surreal elements. The timelines and reincarnation concept are intriguing but underdeveloped, and the writing style, though florid, has its charms. Despite some shortcomings, the book is worth reading, especially for those who appreciate folk tales and unconventional narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars to counteract the misleading marketing)."

            "This book features a fast-paced narrative akin to a TV show, with scenes that flash back and forth and intertwining plotlines. The abrupt transitions between timelines—spanning the 18th century, 4 BCE, and the present—create a disorienting yet effective intensity. The pacing is exhilarating, with moments that leave you suspended and unexpected drops that keep you on your toes. While the ending raises some unanswered questions, it hints at the potential for a trilogy. Although the novel stands alone, it lays the groundwork for future installments that could delve into additional timelines and character arcs. The story is spicier and darker than anticipated, filled with flashbacks, premonitions, and twists that maintain engagement. At its core, the plot centers on the relationship between the main characters, but numerous events propel the narrative forward. The themes of rebirth and life cycles, intertwined with real historical figures like Emperor Yuan and his male lovers, add depth and intrigue to the tale.",
            "The characters are well-developed, and their relationships evolve across various timelines. The 18th-century setting serves as a pivotal moment that twists the narrative and influences future reincarnations. Although the book can stand alone, exploring additional timelines could further enrich character development and illustrate how past cycles shape the present.",

The inclusion of real historical figures and events lends authenticity and depth to the story. Additionally, the symbolism on the book cover, which reflects key events and themes, thoughtfully enhances the reading experience."

While it breaks the mold of a typical genre Romance, it worked well for me as a non-romance reader. The strong emotions and the concept of past lives made the insta-love aspect believable. The book also includes a lot of unapologetically gay and kinky sex, which might not be for everyone.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt off in places, with some scenes feeling sudden and out of place.

I would have preferred an additional 50 pages to make it a more satisfying standalone.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was mostly strong and flowery, fitting the tone of the story. However, the dialogue was weak in places, and there were too many exclamation points, which felt excessive.  \n\n- **Potential for Growth:**  \n  This very much felt like a debut novel, with some quirks that could be improved. If the author refines these aspects, I believe he could easily write a 5-star book for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book has its flaws, particularly in pacing and dialogue, it’s an exciting debut with a unique voice.

The two central characters are far from perfect; their centuries-long journey is fraught with messy decisions and questionable morals.

However, the fast pace of the timelines, while making sense for the story, sometimes felt a little rushed and disjointed, and the characters’ motivations got muddy at times.  \n\n- **Twists and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  There were unexpected twists that had me gasping and yelling into the pages.

The minimal descriptions of the settings were really all that was needed; any more would have detracted from the story.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The way that Huang pushes the boundaries of what makes a story a romance was both compelling and thought-provoking. The two men at the center of this story aren’t perfect, and their journey through the centuries is messy. They make bad decisions, have dubious morals, aren’t staunchly faithful to each other, and their feelings are at times obsessive and unhealthy. They both learn, over and over throughout their many lives, that true love does not necessarily mean a good relationship. It was a refreshing change from a genre that is often limited to happy endings tied up in perfect bows.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  I definitely think Huang has room to grow as an author, particularly with dialogue and pacing. Sometimes the conversations between characters felt stilted, especially in the modern-day chapters. Additionally, while the spicy euphemisms felt appropriate to the time periods they were set in, the term “influence” got more than a little tired, and some of them were so silly I couldn’t help but giggle and be brought out of the story a little.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is an amazing debut novel that delivers on its promises with beautiful storytelling, emotional depth, and a refreshing take on romance. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in dialogue and pacing, I can’t wait to see what else Huang has to offer!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The final fifth of the book felt rushed, especially with the shift to the modern-day timeline. The abrupt time jump and reintroduction of characters left me disoriented, diminishing the overall experience.",
            "The titular couple, Dong Xian and Emperor Ai, are depicted as a toxic pairing rather than an ideal one. Emperor Ai enables Dong Xian’s self-destructive tendencies, while Dong Xian’s relentless ambition ultimately leads to their downfall. I appreciated that their flaws persist across timelines, lending a sense of realism and depth to their relationship, even though I didn’t root for them to stay together. However, the side characters felt underdeveloped and mainly served as plot devices. I wished for more insight into Dowager Fu and the modern-day characters, as their stories were only hinted at through narration rather than shown through their actions. I hope future installments in the trilogy will delve deeper into these characters.",
            "The author's prose is exceptional, featuring smooth transitions between timelines and a remarkable ability to convey historical events and folklore while keeping the reader engaged. However, the decision to italicize Mandarin without using quotation marks was distracting, particularly in sections where all characters spoke Mandarin.

This refreshing perspective drew me in, not to witness their success, but to see if they could escape their destructive cycle.",
            "The novel's synopsis suggests a romance brimming with grand gestures and unwavering devotion, but it ultimately falls short of these expectations.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  The novel’s synopsis sets up expectations for a romance filled with grandiose gestures and endless devotion, which it doesn’t deliver. While there is romance and fantasy, it’s not the wholesome, soulmate-driven story some readers might anticipate, especially those familiar with danmei.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n  The titular couple, Dong Xian and Emperor Ai, are not portrayed as a healthy or ideal pairing. Their relationship is toxic, with Emperor Ai enabling Dong Xian’s self-destructive tendencies and Dong Xian’s insatiable ambition and desire leading to their downfall. I appreciated that their flaws persist throughout the timelines, making their relationship feel realistic and compelling, even if I didn’t root for them to stay together.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel challenges the notion that queer romance must be wholesome and unproblematic. It explores the idea of doomed soulmates connected by fate but destined to destroy each other. This was a refreshing change, and I found myself invested in their story, not to see them succeed but to see if they could break their destructive cycle.  \n\n- **Side Characters:**  \n  The side characters felt underdeveloped and primarily served as plot devices. I wanted to learn more about Dowager Fu and the modern-day characters, but their stories were only hinted at through narration rather than shown through their actions. I hope future installments in the trilogy will expand on these characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Formatting:**  \n  The author’s prose is excellent, with seamless transitions between timelines and a strong ability to convey historical events and folklore without losing the reader. However, the choice to italicize Mandarin without quotation marks was distracting, especially in timelines where everyone spoke Mandarin. This formatting choice felt unnecessary and confusing.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The last fifth of the book felt rushed, particularly when it shifted focus to the modern-day timeline. The sudden time skip and reintroduction of characters left me disoriented, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Erotic Content:**  \n  The erotica includes repetitive, time-appropriate phrasing, such as the “peach plum” euphemism. While this wasn’t a major issue, it did feel somewhat overused.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the novel despite my initial expectations being misaligned with its actual content. The author’s ability to weave complex timelines and craft compelling prose stood out, even if the romantic dynamics and side characters left room for improvement. I rounded up to four stars due to the novel’s strengths and look forward to reading the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐, rounded to 4⭐  \n\n**Trigger Warnings:**  \nRape, drug use (consensual and non-consensual), cheating"

            "The novel explores the lives of two men across three reincarnated lifetimes: modern day, the 1740s, and 4 BCE Han Dynasty China. The author skillfully navigates these shifting time periods, ensuring a balanced focus on each era while slightly favoring the modern setting to unify the narrative. Although the theme of soulmates across lifetimes is familiar, the author infuses it with a magical and sensual quality reminiscent of folklore, adding depth to the story. While the ending didn't evoke strong emotions for me, it felt both inevitable and satisfying, aligning well with the story's premise. Ultimately, it left me with a sense of closure, showcasing the author's talent for crafting a conclusion that resonates with the narrative's themes.",

            "This story, set against the backdrop of historical China and centered on reincarnation, explores the theme of souls reconnecting across different eras. It unfolds across three distinct time periods: 1) an emperor and a lowly clerk, 2) an innkeeper and a fox spirit (which adds a delightful fairytale element), and 3) an artist and his muse. The author skillfully leaves readers in suspense at the end of each chapter, fostering a strong desire to continue reading and discover what happens next.",

I recommend this book to readers who enjoy LGBTQ+ stories with a mix of historical, fantasy, and romantic elements, but advise going in with an open mind.",

It’s clear the author has potential, and the story doesn’t feel bogged down by typical debut pitfalls.\n\n- **Plot Complexity and Reader Engagement:**  \n  The overlapping storylines can be confusing at first, but once I accepted the complexity and stopped trying to track everything perfectly, the book became much more enjoyable. The reincarnation aspect isn’t straightforward, and I appreciated having to piece together the connections between characters and timelines. While some reveals were predictable (one in particular felt obvious), many twists were unexpected, especially the ending, which completely surprised me.\n\n- **Character Development and Story Sections:**  \n  The innkeeper chapters felt weaker compared to the present-day and 4BCE sections. They could have been expanded or developed further, but this wasn’t a major issue for me. Additionally, some of the dialogue in the present-day chapters felt a bit cringe at times, though it didn’t detract significantly from the overall experience.\n\n- **Concept and Execution:**  \n  The concept of the novel is intriguing and well-executed overall. Despite a few shortcomings, the story held my interest and delivered a unique take on reincarnation and love across lifetimes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some minor flaws, *The Emperor and the Endless Palace* is a strong debut with an engaging and complex plot.

The combination of these elements made the story incredibly engaging for me.\n\n- **Narration and Plot Twists:**  \n  The narration kept me guessing throughout the entire book! I was constantly trying to piece things together, and the plot twists, especially when identities were revealed, completely threw me off. I was only half correct about my predictions, which made the experience even more thrilling.\n\n- **Parallels and Symbolism:**  \n  I really enjoyed the parallels between each timeline and how symbols, items, and moments reappeared in different but strikingly similar ways. These connections added depth and richness to the story, making it feel cohesive and meaningful.\n\n- **Characters and Emotional Connection:**  \n  My heart goes out to Calvin and River (and Garden) ;-;. I wish I could hold them dearly and protect them. They deserve so much peace and happiness, and I found myself deeply emotionally invested in their journeys.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a captivating read, blending reincarnation, historical settings, and intricate storytelling. The narration kept me on my toes, the parallels between timelines were beautifully crafted, and the characters left a lasting emotional impact. It’s a story I’ll cherish and revisit.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s not a danmei romance, nor is it intended to be one.  \n  - I would call this a queer, speculative literary novel that examines the boundary between love and obsession.  \n  - This novel is romantic, but don’t expect it to be a genre romance novel. It’s about messy queer Chinese men navigating their relationships with each other.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  - I found the flowery/euphemistic writing during the sex scenes to be jarring rather than poetic.  \n  - Some of the dialogue during the present-day timeline felt a little wooden rather than conversational.  \n  - I didn’t really appreciate the use of the word “triggered” as a joke in one instance.  \n\n- **Historical Interpretation and Accuracy:**  \n  - The real-life Dong Xian had a wife by the time he became Emperor Ai’s lover, and Emperor Ai also took Dong Xian’s sister as his concubine.  \n  - I don’t have any issue with both characters being interpreted as gay rather than bisexual or pansexual in this novel, and obviously this novel isn't supposed to be a totally accurate representation of history, but I did find the omission of these women interesting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and thought-provoking exploration of queer Chinese history and relationships, expertly weaving multiple timelines and delivering satisfying twists. While it has some stylistic flaws, it’s a significant and recommended read for those interested in queer speculative fiction rooted in Chinese traditions.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This is how I prefer to approach most books, and this one is no exception. I highly recommend going into it blind and letting the story unfold on its own terms.  \n\n- **Comparisons:**  \n  The closest comparison I can draw, albeit hesitantly, is *The Wicker King*. It’s been years since I read that book, but the review I wrote for it feels almost identical to the one I’d write for this. Both are deeply immersive experiences that are best discovered firsthand rather than through someone else’s retelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a complex, thought-provoking experience that demands the reader’s full attention. It’s best approached with minimal prior knowledge, allowing the story to unfold in its own unique way. While it’s challenging to fully articulate its impact, it’s a journey worth taking for those who enjoy immersive and unpredictable narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead, the story concluded on an unhappy note with no promises of a better future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started with a light-hearted tone, it delved into darker themes, leaving me wishing for a more resolved and hopeful ending, particularly for the characters River and Calvin.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It felt like the author was trying too hard to be poetic or to fit the historical fiction context, which came across as forced and awkward. For example, referring to genitals as \"my influence\" was a miss and took me out of the story.\n\n- **Plot and Character Development:**  \n  I was hoping for more political intrigue, fantasy, and folklore elements, as well as deeper character development. While the story had good bones, I didn’t feel as connected to the characters as I wanted to.  \n\n- **Potential and Future Work:**  \n  Despite my critiques, I recognize this is a debut novel, and there’s potential here.

However, I have some reservations about the American-Born Chinese (ABC) perspective on ancient Chinese culture. While the author demonstrates thorough research, modern influences occasionally intrude. For instance, Dong Xian, a lowly courtier, refers to himself as 'I' rather than the more fitting 'wretched servant' when addressing the Empress Dowager.

However, I had concerns about an ABC (American-Born Chinese) take on ancient Chinese culture. While Huang has done his research, modern vibes occasionally seep in, such as when Dong Xian, a lowly courtier, refers to himself as 'I' instead of using the more appropriate 'wretched servant' when addressing the Empress Dowager. Additionally, translating well-known Chinese cultural elements, like the yu xi (imperial seal), into English gave me an odd feeling, as it felt slightly disconnected from its original context.\n\n- **Writing Style and Polish:**  \n  Certain passages and descriptor words could have been more polished, particularly in the Thailand scenes. However, other parts of the writing were beautiful and evocative, showcasing the author's ability to craft vivid imagery.\n\n- **Characterization and Reincarnation Theme:**  \n  The premise of reincarnations recognizing past-life loves is a common trope in Chinese webnovels, but it was executed well here. That said, it wasn’t immediately obvious which reincarnation each character was, which could have been clarified better. The innkeeper and the physician's love story was intriguing until it took a dark turn, which was unexpected but added depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Trigger Warnings:**  \n  The novel includes trigger warnings for coercion and noncon, which are important to note for sensitive readers. Despite this, I found the exploration of darker themes compelling, especially in the context of the innkeeper and physician's story. I also have a soft spot for innkeepers in remote settings, reminiscent of Xiao Se in *Blood of Youth*, and I enjoyed the inclusion of nine-tailed fox spirit lore.\n\n- **Erotic Content:**  \n  The sex scenes were a highlight for me, and I found them entertaining and well-written. I was forewarned about the pink plum but was surprised by the eunuch razor blade scene, which was both shocking and memorable. The numerous mentions of 'the influence!' added a humorous touch, and I even read some of the juicier bits aloud to my spouse, making the erotica a fun and engaging aspect of the novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel is a unique and entertaining exploration of queer love, reincarnation, and Chinese cultural elements. While there are areas where the writing could have been more polished and the cultural authenticity more consistent, the story’s strengths—particularly its erotic content, intriguing characters, and dark themes—make it a worthwhile read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25 ⭐️"

            "At 312 pages, the book feels too brief to effectively weave together its three distinct narratives. The opening captivated me, particularly with the introduction of the two historical timelines. However, as the story unfolded, it veered away from my expectations. The ancient China timeline, featuring Courtier Dong Xian and Emperor Liu Xin, stood out as my favorite due to its intricate plot and compelling characters. Unfortunately, it glossed over crucial details, such as the resolution of their story and the origins of the curse, leaving significant questions unanswered. The 1700s timeline showed promise but lacked the space to develop a coherent plot or central romance. Meanwhile, the modern timeline, with its drug-fueled scenes and money boy dynamic, felt disjointed and was my least favorite. The ambiguous and unsatisfying ending further detracted from my enjoyment, as it left too many questions unresolved and failed to provide a satisfying conclusion to both the central romance and the overarching curse.",
            "The ancient China storyline featured the most well-developed characters and plot, effectively establishing both romance and tragedy. However, it left some key elements unresolved, particularly the role of the Jujun character, who inexplicably turns into an antagonist. In contrast, the 1700s timeline struggled with its supernatural elements, lacking sufficient explanations, and the central romance was largely absent. The modern timeline felt disjointed and failed to engage me, especially with the introduction of characters like Garden and Calvin.",
            "I was eager to dive into *The Emperor and the Endless Palace*, drawn in by its promise of a sweeping gay Asian fantasy romance and the positive blurbs it garnered. As a supporter of queer narratives and Asian fantasy, I believed I would be the ideal audience for this book. Unfortunately, it fell short of the expectations set by its marketing. The story offers only a superficial glimpse into the cyclical reincarnation of the two lovers, lacking the epic romance I had anticipated. Rather than a romantasy or fantasy romance, I would categorize it as a homoerotic thriller with fantasy elements. While a central doomed romance exists, it rarely feels genuinely romantic. The numerous gay sex scenes, often not between the main characters, are more narrative devices than erotic moments, described with euphemisms like “his influence” and “arriving.” The emphasis lies on political intrigue in ancient China, supernatural mysteries in the 1700s, and thriller elements in the modern timeline, overshadowing the romance and the development of the protagonists' love."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Emperor and the Endless Palace* had the potential to be a captivating story, but it fell short of its promise. While the ancient China timeline stood out for its complexity and character development, the other timelines lacked cohesion and depth. The book’s focus on tension over romance, unresolved plot points, and an unsatisfying ending left me intrigued but ultimately disappointed.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Expectations:**  \n  I was excited to read *The Emperor and the Endless Palace* based on its premise as a sweeping gay Asian fantasy romance and the positive blurbs it received. As someone who enjoys supporting queer stories and Asian fantasies, I felt I was the right audience for this book. However, the story did not meet the expectations set by its marketing and descriptions. It only delivered the barest outline of the cyclical reincarnation of the two lovers, falling short of the epic romance I anticipated.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  I hesitate to classify this as a romantasy or fantasy romance. Instead, I would describe it as a homoerotic thriller with fantasy elements. While there is a central doomed romance, it never feels romantic. The book includes many gay sex scenes, but they are rarely between the main characters and are not erotic. These scenes serve a narrative function and are described briefly with euphemisms like “his influence,” “his invitation,” and “arriving.” The focus is on tension—political intrigue in ancient China, supernatural mystery in the 1700s, and thriller elements in the modern timeline—rather than on the romance or how the protagonists fall in love.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  At 312 pages, the book feels too short to adequately tell what are essentially three separate stories linked together. The beginning hooked me, especially with the introduction of the two past timelines. However, as the story progressed, it never went where I wanted it to go. The ancient China timeline, featuring Courtier Dong Xian and Emperor Liu Xin, was my favorite due to its complex plot and compelling characters. Unfortunately, it skips over crucial details, such as how their story ends and how the curse began, leaving important questions unanswered. The 1700s timeline had potential but lacked space to develop a coherent plot or central romance. The modern timeline, with its drug-fueled scenes and money boy dynamic, felt out of place and was my least favorite.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot Cohesion:**  \n  The ancient China storyline had the most developed characters and plot, setting up the romance and tragedy effectively. However, it left key elements unresolved, such as the role of the Jujun character, who inexplicably becomes their foe. The 1700s timeline lacked adequate explanations for its supernatural elements, and the central romance was mostly absent. The modern timeline felt disjointed and failed to resonate with me, especially with the addition of characters like Garden and Calvin.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ambiguous and unsatisfying ending further diminished my enjoyment of the book. It left too many questions unanswered and failed to deliver a satisfying resolution to the central romance or the overarching curse.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Emperor and the Endless Palace* had the potential to be a captivating story, but it fell short of its promise. While the ancient China timeline stood out for its complexity and character development, the other timelines lacked cohesion and depth. The book’s focus on tension over romance, unresolved plot points, and an unsatisfying ending left me intrigued but ultimately disappointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "My main issue with the book was the sex scenes. While such scenes can be effective, I found them to be the weakest parts of the narrative. In the first half, they often came off as unintentionally comical, disrupting my immersion in the story. Although there was a tone shift midway that improved them somewhat, it wasn't enough to fully redeem these moments.",
            "As a fan of reincarnation stories, I approached this one with high hopes. The concept of River and Joey being reborn repeatedly to rectify past mistakes was captivating. I appreciated how each incarnation retained both unique and familiar traits, enriching their eternal bond. It was also a delightful surprise to learn that the story is rooted in the origin of the term “cut sleeve,” which I found intriguing. However, I recommend checking the content warnings, as the book touches on themes that pushed my comfort boundaries, including blood, death, drug use, fire, infidelity, sexual assault, toxic relationships, violence, mental illness, and more."

While sex scenes aren’t inherently problematic, I felt they were the worst-written parts of the book.

There was a tone shift midway through, which improved them slightly, but not enough to fully redeem them.\n\n- **Content and Warnings:**  \n  I highly recommend checking the content warnings for this book, as it skated the edge of what I’m comfortable reading. The themes and scenes included blood, death, drug abuse/use, fire, infidelity, rape/sexual assault, sexual content, sexual violence, toxic relationships, violence, alcohol, animal death, mental illness, panic attacks, abandonment, cancer, death of a parent, medical content, and vomit.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling concept and strong character dynamics, the execution of certain elements, particularly the sex scenes, detracted from my overall enjoyment.

            "The revelation that River is the reincarnated emperor, rather than Dong Xian, was a pivotal moment that enriched the narrative. The ambiguity surrounding the curse and the fox spirit's choice to sacrifice happiness for revenge provoked deep reflection. The chilling final scene, in which the fox spirit transfers the power of memory to He Shican, left me questioning whether it was a gift or a curse. The story's ambiguous and predominantly tragic ending may polarize readers, particularly those hoping for a triumphant queer romance. It's essential for readers to adjust their expectations, recognizing that this book diverges from conventional romance and fantasy tropes.",
            "The complex relationship dynamics, especially Joey's struggle to break free from Winston's influence and be with River, were captivating. The mystery of reincarnated souls and the gradual revelation of their identities kept me thoroughly engaged. The final chapters, which delved into the curse and the characters' motivations, were particularly compelling and elevated the overall narrative.",
            "The sex scenes were well-paced and skillfully crafted, but certain terminology, such as \"influence\" and \"pink plum,\" felt distracting and cringe-worthy. While not the worst, the erotic elements could have been enhanced with more thoughtful word choices.",
            "The seamless integration of myth, magic, history, and contemporary queer culture was a standout feature. The portrayal of the “cut sleeve” myth, along with the exploration of Asian American gay culture in LA and the vibrant queer scene in Bangkok, was both fascinating and enriching.",
            "The book's marketing is misleading, as it does not fit the expectations of romance readers. The minimal focus on the relationship between Dong Xian and the Emperor may disappoint those seeking a love story, and the ending is more tragic than triumphant, further straying from the romance genre. Additionally, the novel leans toward magical realism rather than traditional fantasy, which may not resonate with all fantasy enthusiasts. Literary fiction readers might also be deterred by the inclusion of erotica. While the book's defiance of easy categorization is a strength, it could also alienate certain audiences."

        "conclusion": "This is a bold, genre-defying novel with compelling ideas, intricate character dynamics, and a narrative full of twists. While its marketing may mislead some readers, those who appreciate its unique blend of magical realism, mythology, and queer culture will find much to admire. The tragic yet thought-provoking ending, though polarizing, adds depth to the story.

The story of a love that transcends time, and two people finding each other again and again across the centuries, is such a great concept.\"  \n  - \"Overall, I liked the story.\"  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  - \"I think my biggest struggle was that I didn’t really connect with the characters. Although they interested me, I didn’t particularly care about them because they felt a bit flat.\"  \n  - \"It’s kind of poetic and detached which is probably what made me struggle connecting with the characters as well.\"  \n  - \"I think River’s POV (which was more present day-like) was probably the one I enjoyed the most. It was the least poetic of the lot.\"  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - \"The book was also written in a way that I don’t really get on with. It’s kind of poetic and detached.\"  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience Appeal:**  \n  - \"Definitely interested in seeing what this author does in the future.\"  \n  - \"Give it a try if you like:👑Multiple POVs👑Timelines from different historical periods👑Queer love stories with some poetic spice👑Books inspired by Chinese history/mythology.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s concept of timeless love and its exploration of different historical periods were compelling, the poetic and detached writing style made it difficult to connect with the characters. Despite this, the story was enjoyable, and River’s perspective stood out as the most engaging. The book has potential, and I’m curious to see what the author creates next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

I didn’t realize the book would be so focused on sex, and I’d argue that it was only centered on sexual desire rather than romance. There was no romance during any of the lifetimes, which didn’t align with my expectations.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Out of the three timelines, I was most interested in Dong Xian’s story, especially since it’s based on real historical figures. However, the romance (if it can be called that) didn’t work for me. Dong Xian seemed to be going along with the Emperor’s grandmother’s plans, which made it feel like he wasn’t genuinely interested in the Emperor. It seemed like Fu put the thought in his head rather than seeing him cultivate that attraction naturally.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  The book was a super fast read and may have helped bring me out of my reading slump, which is a positive aspect.  \n\n- **Premise and Execution:**  \n  The premise was fantastic, but I would have enjoyed it more if it had been executed differently.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and was a quick read, it didn’t meet my expectations in terms of romance and character relationships. The focus on sexual desire over genuine romance, particularly in Dong Xian’s storyline, left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "This book undoubtedly has a target audience, but I’m not part of it—and that’s perfectly fine. I’m not typically drawn to smut or spicy content, and when I requested this book, I didn’t anticipate a heavy emphasis on those elements. My main concern lies in how the book is marketed as a Romantasy, with the synopsis barely mentioning its erotic nature. While some author reviews do highlight this aspect, it’s crucial for potential readers to know that this is primarily an erotic fantasy focused more on lust than romance. I believe it’s unfair not to clearly indicate the book’s sexual content from the outset. The author has playfully acknowledged this on Instagram, and there’s nothing wrong with the book’s explicitness; it simply needs to be more transparent so readers know what to expect. This is a vital consideration for all authors who tread the line of erotica, especially when the content leans heavily in that direction."

I’m not much of a smut/spice seeker, and when I requested this book, I wasn’t expecting a lot of spice.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Format:**  \n  It took me a minute to get my bearings with Justinian’s style of (beautiful) writing and the format of the book. I even had to use the dictionary a few times, which is rare for me! Once I did, I enjoyed the story for the most part.  \n\n- **Genre and Marketing:**  \n  My biggest issue was the way this book is being marketed as a Romantasy, with the synopsis hardly mentioning erotica, smut, or spice at all. Some of the fellow author review quotes mention it, thankfully. This is definitely erotic fantasy with some romance (but mostly lust). I don’t think it’s fair to the reader to not lead with how sexual the book is. I know the author has been joking about this on IG, and there’s NOTHING wrong with how sexual the book is; I just think it needs to be obvious from the start so folks know what they’re getting into. This stands for all authors when you’re bordering the line of erotica (and this is far past that line).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Author Potential:**  \n  I give 4 stars for a great story and amazing writing, especially for a debut novel, but I deducted a star for being misled. I will definitely keep an eye on this author and would read more of his writing if it was less erotica and more romance. If he never writes that kind of book, that’s okay (you do you, boo!). I wish him lots of success as a queer Asian author.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to the author and NetGalley for a digital ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book wasn’t quite what I expected due to its heavy focus on erotica, I appreciated the beautiful writing and engaging story. However, I believe the marketing should more accurately reflect the book’s content to set the right expectations for readers. I look forward to seeing more from this talented author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

            "Kudos to Garden, who truly deserves the title of Sister of the Year. Her unwavering support for her brother in such a ridiculous situation is commendable, adding a touch of sanity and relatability to the story. While a moving love story hinges on the depth of the relationship, the book falls short in illustrating the origin and development of Liu Xin and Dong Xian's bond. Their transition from strangers to eternal lovers is condensed into a single sentence, leaving me puzzled about the reasons behind their love across lifetimes. In contrast, the author devotes several pages to River’s drug use at raves, which feels disproportionate and detracts from the core narrative.",
            "The book is filled with bizarre Easter eggs that detract from the plot, such as a billionaire who bankrupts Elon Musk and River’s mother’s connection to a pastor. These elements feel out of place and disrupt the reader's suspension of disbelief. Additionally, the story suffers from an identity crisis, fluctuating between serious historical romantasy and AO3-style erotica. This tonal inconsistency makes the characters feel bipolar and difficult to understand, as they shift between poetic Chinese cultural references and exaggerated, campy stereotypes. It seems the author prioritizes personal enjoyment over coherence, resulting in self-inflicted issues throughout the narrative. While the author demonstrates talent and a vivid imagination, the book ultimately feels like a missed opportunity for a compelling traditional romantasy, leaning instead into a Wattpad-esque style.",
            "This story presents an alternate universe (AU) inspired by the real historical relationship between Emperor Ai of Han and Dong Xian, with many side characters drawn from history. The author skillfully balances the power struggles of Ai’s reign while creating a more inclusive world. Cultural authenticity is enhanced by the inclusion of the nine-tail fox spirit, a classic figure in Chinese mythology, whose unique twist of unintentionally extracting life essence through sex is particularly clever. Although the ending is not happy, it is fitting and thought-provoking. River's realization of the toxicity of his eternal love, coupled with Joey's obsession, leaves the narrative open-ended, highlighting both the peril and preciousness of their love.",
            "I approached this story with high hopes, as gay romances and fantasies are among my favorite genres.

As an ethically Chinese reader familiar with the culture, I love books that play with narratives and undying love. On paper, this book should have been exactly my thing, but the reality was more mixed.\n\n- **Strengths in Storytelling and Authenticity:**  \n  The story is essentially an alternate universe (AU) based on the real historical gay couple, Emperor Ai of Han and Dong Xian. Most side characters are also historical figures. While the author made the world more gay-friendly, he portrayed the power struggle of Ai’s reign very well, creating a balanced and intriguing narrative. The cultural authenticity extends beyond this, with elements like the nine-tail fox spirit, a classic figure in Chinese mythology, whose twist of unintentionally extracting life essence through sex is ingenious. The ending, though not happy, is fitting and thought-provoking. River’s realization of the toxicity of his eternal love and Joey’s obsession leave the story open-ended, acknowledging both the peril and preciousness of their love.\n\n- **Weaknesses in Execution and Tone:**  \n  The book is littered with bizarre Easter eggs that don’t contribute to the plot, such as a billionaire who bankrupted Elon Musk or River’s mother’s involvement with a pastor. These elements feel out of place and disrupt suspension of disbelief. The book also suffers from an identity crisis, oscillating between serious historical romantasy and AO3-style erotica. This tonal whiplash makes the characters feel bipolar and hard to understand. They lack real personalities, switching between speaking in poetic Chinese cultural references and embodying exaggerated, campy stereotypes.\n\n- **Character Development and Plot Focus:**  \n  The key to a moving undying love story is the love itself, yet the book fails to show the origin or development of the relationship between Liu Xin and Dong Xian. Their transition from strangers to eternal lovers is summarized in one sentence, leaving me unable to understand why they love each other across lifetimes. In contrast, the author spends multiple pages detailing River’s drug use at raves, which feels disproportionate and irrelevant to the core narrative.\n\n- **Author’s Intent and Style:**  \n  The author seems more concerned with having fun writing the book than ensuring coherence. Every issue appears deliberately self-inflicted for the author’s personal enjoyment. While the author is clearly a talented writer with a fascinating imagination, the book feels like a missed opportunity to create a great traditional romantasy, instead leaning into a Wattpad-esque style.\n\n- **Standout Character:**  \n  Shout out to Garden, who deserves to be the sister of the year. Her unwavering support for her brother in such a ridiculous situation is commendable. Her character adds a touch of sanity and relatability to the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a mixed bag, with moments of brilliance overshadowed by bizarre choices and tonal inconsistencies.

            "The characters are deeply flawed, and their imperfections lead to significant consequences. While I occasionally found it difficult to connect with them, I believe this was intentional. However, some characters, such as the emperor, felt underdeveloped and one-dimensional at times, leaving me wishing for greater depth and exploration of certain individuals.",

While I appreciated this unique perspective, it ultimately wasn't my preferred style of romance, making it difficult for me to fully support the couples.

It follows three timelines from individual points of view: Dong Xian in 4 BCE, He Shican in 1740, and River in the present day. The reader is taken on a reincarnation journey where three souls are forever intertwined. The story explores an endless loop of reincarnation, an ancient curse, and a promise to break it. The timelines reveal commonalities, tangled love, and a magical force interfering with the characters' lives. However, it’s not always clear which reincarnated soul belongs to whom or who truly belongs together.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each timeline provides deeper layers into the souls of the characters. Dong Xian’s timeline is the most thought-out, focusing on his strategies for power and influence in the Emperor’s Palace. He Shican’s timeline is the most fantastical, exploring his search for identity, escape from his father’s disappointment, and unrequited love for a doctor.

The author effectively blends Chinese fantasy and historical fiction, creating an intriguing setting.  \n\n- **Erotic and Sensual Elements:**  \n  The novel straddles the erotic line, with sex and drugs playing a constant role. While the modern conventional sense of love between the souls isn’t strongly felt, the magnetic pull and endless connection between them are palpable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Emperor and the Endless Palace is a captivating reincarnation story that blends Chinese mythology, historical fiction, and fantasy.

            "The plot ultimately fell short of its intriguing premise, with some elements feeling convoluted and lacking clear reasoning. For instance, the numerous characters involved in the scheme to make Dong Xian the emperor's official courtesan seemed excessive—why not simply inform him of the plan?

The metaphors used in these scenes felt comical and didn’t align with the angsty tone of the rest of the novel. While I noticed some improvement halfway through, the initial chapters had gratuitous sex scenes that didn’t involve the two main characters together, which felt unnecessary.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character building was inconsistent. Since the first timeline is told from one main character’s perspective and the other two from the other’s, it was challenging to draw parallels between the characters across timelines. I often forgot which character was which in the later timelines. Additionally, I never felt like I truly got to know the emperor in the first timeline or Joey in the present day, as they were largely absent for significant portions of the story.\n\n- **Plot Execution:**  \n  The plot didn’t fully live up to the intriguing premise. Some parts felt convoluted without clear reasoning. For example, the number of people involved in the plot to make Dong Xian the official courtesan of the emperor seemed unnecessary—why didn’t they just tell him the plan? He was ambitious and willing to trade sex for power, so he likely would have agreed. The art heist subplot also felt underdeveloped. The ending lacked resolution, which I later realized was because it’s the first book of a trilogy. However, I didn’t know this going in, so I was left wondering how everything would wrap up in the final pages.\n\n- **Potential and Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed the novel and read it quickly, which speaks to its potential. The premise of lovers reincarnating across three timelines is fascinating, and I’m curious to see where the story goes. I’ll likely continue with the rest of the trilogy if it’s released.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its flaws, particularly in the execution of sex scenes, character development, and plot complexity, it remains an engaging read with a compelling premise. I’m hopeful that the author will address these issues in the subsequent books of the trilogy.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nTorn between 3 and 4 stars."

I found it interesting and enjoyed the overall idea, though it sometimes fell flat in execution.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I wished there had been more character development. The characters had potential, but they didn’t feel as fleshed out as they could have been.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows three different timelines, which I loved, but this meant each timeline received less attention than I thought it deserved. Each timeline could have been a full novel on its own. Despite this, I flew through the book and enjoyed a lot of it.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This is not a traditional romance novel in the sense of the romance genre. It’s more of a fantasy, mythology-retelling, and thriller with a central plot about love and star-crossed lovers, similar to *Romeo & Juliet*. Themes include unrequited love, reincarnation, and toxic relationships.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book contains a fair amount of sex, some of which is consensual, but a lot is non-consensual or questionably consensual (e.g., involving drugs). These scenes are not romanticized and are integral to the plot, depicting manipulation and toxic relationships. While not gratuitously violent or overly traumatic, readers should proceed with caution if these themes are upsetting.\n\n- **Romance Details (No Spoilers):**  \n  - Genders: m/m  \n  - POV: First person, rotating between three timelines every chapter  \n  - Themes & Tropes: Star-crossed lovers, unrequited love, mythology retelling, reincarnation  \n  - Sex Scenes: Yes, quite a few, but not constant smut.

Although there were moments where it almost succeeded, it ultimately failed to deliver.",

This departure from typical romance tropes may be hurting its ratings.  \n  - The publisher’s categorization of the book as a romance might be misleading, as the story’s focus on love doesn’t align with readers’ expectations of the genre.  \n\n- **Ambiguity and Unanswered Questions:**  \n  - The novel leaves many questions unanswered, reflecting the leads’ own lack of full knowledge due to being kept in the dark by other characters and the nature of reincarnation.  \n  - While this ambiguity might frustrate some readers, I appreciated it as it added depth and realism to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptiveness:**  \n  - The sex scenes are less explicit than many reviews suggest, relying heavily on euphemisms for anatomy and erections.  \n  - The use of euphemisms occasionally leads to clunky writing, and a more direct approach might have improved the prose.  \n\n- **Ending and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - The conclusion, where one lead walks away, felt emotionally resonant and appropriate given the circumstances.  \n  - The acknowledgment of a lingering hollowness in the lead’s life added a poignant layer to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s categorization as a romance may mislead readers expecting a conventional love story, it offers a thought-provoking and emotionally rich narrative.

While each timeline has its own unique feel, only the 1740 segment offers a cohesive beginning, middle, and end. The 4 BCE timeline starts strong but concludes with an open and somewhat lackluster ending.

            "The concept of following characters through three lifetimes is intriguing, especially the past timelines featuring the Fox-Spirit. Initially, the tension in the Endless Palace is well-executed, but it diminishes abruptly when a key character ceases to intervene, despite earlier hints about their nature. The present timeline is harder to connect with, making it difficult to invest in the characters. The resolution feels unsatisfying, as it fails to address what I viewed as the main obstacle. Additionally, the open ending leaves too many unresolved threads across timelines, particularly in the current one, making it feel more like the conclusion of a first installment than a standalone story.",

The swift progression of love between the characters seemed more like desire or infatuation than genuine love. Additionally, the portrayal of a third character's emotions, along with the surrounding manipulation, made it hard to accept the label assigned to those feelings."

It’s less a romance book about the romance itself and more about what it does to the main characters.  \n- **Narrative Structure and Suspense:**  \n  It was interesting and cool to see how the different time periods overlapped and mirrored each other. The author did a great job of maintaining suspense by switching between narratives every chapter.  \n- **Subversion of Tropes:**  \n  I liked how the book turned the “traditional” soulmates narrative on its head, even if that wasn’t what I initially wanted.  \n- **Historical Context and Inspiration:**  \n  I realized the historical storylines were based on actual Chinese history and stories, which is super cool! I recognized the “cut sleeve” story but didn’t realize the characters were based on historical figures—I love that detail.  \n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing style didn’t work for me; it felt like reading poorly written YA, especially in the modern storyline.  \n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  I wish the book was longer. At ~300 pages, it felt insufficient for the amount of narrative and worldbuilding the author tried to include. More time with the characters and a deeper exploration of their relationships would have made the story hit harder. As it was, it reminded me of a fairy tale, where everything is “tell, not show,” with no time to slow down and linger in a scene.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had intriguing elements, such as its narrative structure, subversion of tropes, and historical inspiration, but it fell short for me due to the writing style and pacing.

The characters felt underdeveloped, and their stories lacked the depth needed to make me truly care about them.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose was beautiful, and the author definitely has a talent for writing.

It’s a promising debut, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up."

This made it difficult to fully invest in River and Joey’s relationship, especially by the end.  \n\n- **Historical Storylines:**  \n  The ancient and imperial China storylines were weaker compared to the modern-day narrative. As the book progressed, these sections felt rushed, with numerous plot points that either went unresolved or were unclear. This detracted from the overall cohesion of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Twist and Pacing:**  \n  The twist regarding the past POV characters was jarring and poorly executed. It required a significant mental recalibration three-quarters of the way through the book, which disrupted the reading experience.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This book is a very spicy fantasy read. I struggle to label it as a romance due to the moral ambiguity and complex relationship dynamics. It appeals more to readers who enjoy \"love stories\" rather than conventional happily-ever-after (HEA) romance narratives. Traditional romance readers might not find it as satisfying, but I personally found it intriguing.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are not always likable, and their decisions can be questionable. However, their dramatic actions and personalities kept me engaged and coming back for more.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  I typically dislike time-centric plot points like time travel, groundhog day, or reincarnation, but this book incorporated such elements in a way that kept me engaged despite my usual aversion. The execution was well done and added depth to the story.\n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  I would recommend this book to a specific kind of reader rather than a broad \"romantasy\" audience. It’s best suited for those who appreciate morally complex and unconventional love stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a captivating and spicy fantasy read with morally ambiguous characters and a complex relationship dynamic. While it may not appeal to traditional romance readers, it offers an intriguing and dramatic narrative that kept me engaged. The unique incorporation of time-centric elements was well executed, making it a standout for readers who enjoy unconventional love stories.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It can be confusing, but the audiobook’s use of different narrators for each timeline helped clarify things.  \n- **Romance Development:** The romance between the two main characters is a slow burn, with spice occurring with different characters at first. There’s one particularly memorable scene involving a razorblade that stands out.  \n- **Content Warnings:** Not all the spice is consensual, which is something readers should be aware of.  \n- **Acknowledgments:** Thanks to Harlequin Trade Publishing and NetGalley for the early copy, and to Libro.fm for the ALC.

Despite these flaws, the final twist was appreciated, and there’s potential for the author to deliver something exceptional in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Some of the metaphors, particularly those for men banging men, were so weird that they had me grimacing at the audiobook.  \n\n- **Timelines/Plot Structure:**  \n  - The 4 BCE timeline was the most intriguing, and I would love to read an entire book dedicated to just that timeline.  \n  - The 1700s timeline was odd in its emphasis on magic.  \n  - The Present Day timeline felt childish and ridiculous compared to the other two.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was A Choice. I would have liked it more if it had been executed better, as I expected more closure to the individual stories.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of the book was interesting, the execution fell short for me. The writing style, particularly the heavy-handed imagery and odd metaphors, detracted from the experience. The timelines varied in quality, with the 4 BCE timeline standing out as the most compelling. The ending left me wanting more closure.

I loved the historical aspects and the idea of a queer reincarnation love story—it was a unique and compelling premise.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters needed to be developed further. The constant switching of perspectives didn’t allow enough time to delve into the individual relationships, which left me wanting more depth and connection with the characters.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. The twists were jarring and didn’t land well for me. Additionally, the open ending was a personal disappointment, as I prefer more conclusive resolutions.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I enjoyed the novel for its creativity and unique ideas, but I was ultimately disappointed because it didn’t fully realize its potential. It left me wishing for a more polished and satisfying execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a fascinating concept and some standout elements, it fell short in character development, pacing, and delivering a satisfying conclusion. It was an enjoyable read but left me wanting more from what could have been a truly great story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Maybe it’s because we enter a romance at multiple stages for the same people, or maybe it’s the POV reveal that means you have to second-guess how each character feels about the other. Whatever it was, it didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  Have I ever read a romance novel with such an impending sense of doom before?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s reincarnation and magic elements were intriguing, and the alternating timelines added a unique structure, the romance fell flat for me. The multiple stages of the same romance and the POV reveal made it difficult to connect with the characters’ feelings, leaving the emotional impact lacking.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The plot eventually took over and held my interest.  \n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The switching between 3 POVs and 3 points in time was done very effectively.  \n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The mythology was very interesting. I was initially worried about the book leaping straight into the spice (multiple \"encounters\" in the first two chapters!), but this concern was alleviated as the story progressed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started slow for me, it quickly became captivating due to its well-executed narrative structure, engaging plot, and intriguing mythology. The initial focus on romantic encounters was a minor concern, but it didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I found these critiques to be weak and lacking an appreciation for the campy style in which they were presented.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The novel fell short for me because, despite being a big, sweeping romance, the characters lacked personality.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Complexity:**  \n  - The novel features three timelines, but they are clearly demarcated, making it easy to follow.  \n  - The reincarnation element adds intrigue, as readers try to piece together the connections between characters across time.  \n  - There’s a well-executed twist that reshapes the reader’s understanding of the story, though it avoids feeling like a cheap “gotcha” moment.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  - Some of the sex scenes, particularly in the older incarnations, use cringe-worthy euphemistic language, which felt jarring but may have been intentional for the time period.  \n  - The writing voice occasionally feels juvenile and coming-of-age-like, which contrasts with the heavy content of the story.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Themes:**  \n  - The novel includes instances of sexual assault (SA) in the 4 BCE timeline, which should have been flagged with a content warning.  \n  - The romance is messy, dramatic, and complicated, with a bittersweet open ending that fits the story’s context.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The characters are not unproblematic, and their unresolved issues make the ending feel authentic to who they are.  \n  - The 4 BCE timeline was the most compelling, likely due to personal preference.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite some flaws, the novel was enjoyable, and I would recommend it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel weaves together three timelines with a reincarnation theme, offering a complex and intriguing story. While the writing style occasionally feels mismatched with the heavy content and some scenes use awkward language, the plot twist and character dynamics are well-executed. The open ending, though bittersweet, feels fitting. Despite its flaws, it’s a compelling read worth recommending.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was waiting for a more climactic payoff, and instead, a couple of the storylines' endings felt more like they got summarized in the last few pages.\n\n- **Dialogue and Authenticity:**  \n  I wasn't into the dialogue. It felt stilted and unrealistic enough in the modern-day settings that it took me out of the story (a distracting lack of contractions, for one, and also exposition-y in random places where exposition honestly wasn't needed). However, this didn't bother me in the slightest in the historical settings.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a compelling concept and strong fantastical elements, the execution fell short for me due to unclear character mapping, underwhelming pacing, and unrealistic modern-day dialogue.

            "The book weaves together three timelines: contemporary (or slightly future) Los Angeles, 1700s China, and 4 BCE Han dynasty China. I anticipated either a star-crossed romance or a complex tale of reincarnated lives, but the narrative fell short on both fronts. The ancient China storyline, intended as the foundation, lacked the depth of a compelling romance. Additionally, the transitions between timelines and the explanations provided at the end felt rushed and confusing, making it difficult to follow the plot and grasp the story's overarching purpose.",

His vibrant personality made me wish he were part of my social circle, even if I couldn't keep up with him. I appreciated the portrayal of one of the gay protagonists navigating queer LA nightlife, including a nuanced depiction of drug use that resonated with my own experiences. The book's exploration of queer identity and its unapologetic inclusion of queer sex were standout elements for me. As a fan of more sex in SFF, especially queer representation, this book certainly delivered.",

The cover is stunning, making it one of the most visually appealing books I've seen.

I appreciated the unique inclusion of this subculture in an SFF novel.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I loved how the book portrayed one of the gay protagonists experiencing queer LA nightlife, including a neutral depiction of drug use.

It could have delved into the idea of sexuality as a weapon or a means of gaining and using power. However, these themes were not fully developed or explored in a meaningful way.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Content:**  \n  The writing often felt like bad erotica, with phrases like \"pink plum\" being particularly cringe-worthy. The dialogue was questionable and did not feel authentic or engaging.  \n\n- **Plot and Logic:**  \n  The plot lacked coherence and depth. Key elements, such as the curse and the magical claim/power of a third character, were not adequately explained or fleshed out, leaving many unanswered questions.  \n\n- **Consent and Ethical Concerns:**  \n  The book included a lot of dubious consent, which was unexpected and uncomfortable. This aspect was not handled with the sensitivity or depth it required.  \n\n- **Personal Engagement:**  \n  I found myself finishing the book more out of spite than genuine interest. It felt like I might not be the intended audience, or perhaps I missed something crucial, but overall, the book failed to resonate with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had the potential to explore complex and thought-provoking themes, it fell short in execution.

The idea of star-crossed lovers reuniting across time is compelling and had great potential.  \n\n- **Sexually Explicit Scenes:**  \n  The book contains several sexually explicit scenes early on, which were very graphic but didn’t feel like erotica. These scenes lacked emotional depth, making it seem like the author was observing rather than immersing the reader in the experiences. The approach felt inconsistent—either less explicit or more erotic would have worked better. The lack of advertising as a \"spicy\" book added to the shock of encountering these scenes so early, especially before forming a connection with the characters.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  The characters were difficult to follow due to the three separate timelines, which were only loosely connected by the concept of reincarnated souls. Spending multiple chapters away from each story made it hard to remember who was who, and by the end, I didn’t feel deeply connected to any of the characters. The emotional distance persisted even during intimate scenes, which were supposed to highlight the reunion of star-crossed lovers.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt like an afterthought, with the main focus being the soulmate connection. The insta-love dynamic made the romance feel shallow, as the characters’ connection seemed based solely on their soulmate bond rather than genuine development. The plot, which mainly unfolded in the last 25-30% of the book, felt unsatisfying and served only as a device to reunite the soulmates.

This was unexpected, as there was no erotica tag, and I was anticipating grand gestures and soulmate-y elements. The graphic nature of the scenes was jarring and not what I was looking for in this story.\n\n- **Personal Preference:**  \n  While the book might appeal to readers who enjoy erotica, it wasn’t for me. I don’t find such graphic content necessary in a book, and it detracted from my enjoyment.

The emperor timeline was the highlight, offering a more engaging plot, but the modern-day timeline fell flat, and the nine-tailed fox timeline was merely passable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"

The tone resembles that of Wattpad stories or works by authors like Sarah J. Maas and Colleen Hoover, albeit with a gay twist. It appears to be tailored for a specific audience, particularly middle school girls who romanticize yaoi.",

The sex scenes are often bizarre and uncomfortable, featuring elements like eunuchs with razor blades in their mouths and characters using drugs alongside their true love’s grandmother. Furthermore, the depiction of sexual assault is unrealistic and troubling, as characters appear largely unaffected by their traumatic experiences.",
            "I found the story unengaging and uninspiring. By the time I reached 80% of the book, I could easily predict the ending, and I finished it more out of obligation than genuine interest.

River’s actions, like deciding to break a centuries-old curse but then immediately getting distracted by parties and random hook-ups, felt inconsistent and frustrating.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book heavily focuses on circuit parties, drugs, and orgies, which overshadowed any potential plot. The sex scenes were bizarre and often uncomfortable, such as eunuchs holding razor blades in their mouths or characters doing drugs with their true love’s grandmother. Additionally, the portrayal of sexual assault was unrealistic and problematic, with characters seemingly unaffected by traumatic experiences.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The writing felt overly dramatic and \"fake deep,\" with quotes that seemed designed to sound profound but came across as pretentious. The tone reminded me of Wattpad stories or books by authors like SJM (Sarah J. Maas) and CoHo (Colleen Hoover), but with a gay twist. It seemed tailored to a specific audience, like middle school girls who romanticize yaoi.\n\n- **Engagement and Investment:**  \n  I was not entertained or invested in the story. By the time I reached 80% of the book, I could predict the ending, but I finished it out of obligation rather than interest. The lack of character agency and the repetitive, nonsensical events made it hard to care about the outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a confusing and unsatisfying read. The disjointed timelines, shallow characters, and excessive focus on drugs and sex overshadowed any potential plot or meaningful themes. The unrealistic portrayal of trauma and the pretentious writing style further detracted from the experience. While fans of dramatic, over-the-top stories might enjoy it, I found it difficult to connect with or appreciate.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Theme and Genre:**  \n  The theme of stretching past lives and ancient Chinese fantasy is intriguing and well-executed. However, the book doesn’t align with typical romance expectations, leaning more towards thriller plot twists, betrayals, and toxic relationships rather than epic, ideal romances.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters feel shallow and lack depth, especially across their different lifetimes. Their relationships are unconvincing, relying heavily on \"fate\" and lust rather than meaningful development. Their behaviors often come across as strange and inconsistent.\n\n- **Pacing and Story Length:**  \n  The story feels too short for its ambitious scale, leaving insufficient time to build depth or fully explore the characters and their relationships. The ending moves too quickly, creating confusion and leaving many questions unanswered.\n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building falls short of its potential, especially given the rich backdrop of Chinese ancient folklore and historical fantasy. It feels underdeveloped and doesn’t fully utilize the setting’s possibilities.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The open-ended conclusion aims to leave a lasting impression and encourage reflection, but it instead leaves the reader with more questions than answers, resulting in a sense of dissatisfaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an interesting theme and some engaging elements, it struggles with character depth, pacing, and world-building. The story’s rushed ending and unresolved questions detract from its overall impact. It may appeal to fans of m/m stories with similar themes, but it didn’t fully meet my expectations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I had high hopes for it, but it ultimately fell flat—flatter than a crepe.  \n\n- **Story Execution and Development:**  \n  The execution and development of the story were lacking, even by the end. It felt like it could have been a novella given the limited amount of substantial information. Removing roughly half of the sexual content and drug usage would have made this clearer.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n  There was very little exploration of the characters' relationships outside of their sexual nature. While there was some development in the \"first\" lifetime and a bit in the \"second,\" it wasn’t enough to make me feel emotionally invested in the couple when tragedy struck.  \n\n- **Use of Sensitive Themes:**  \n  Rape was used to establish certain characters as villains in both timelines. While this is a heavy theme, I felt there were other ways to convey their villainy through their actions. One instance in the second timeline was particularly jarring and unexpected, to the point where I almost stopped reading.  \n\n- **Plot Concept and Potential:**  \n  I typically love reincarnation and \"find you in another lifetime\" plots because they often blend history, setting, and emotional depth in a way that tugs at readers' heartstrings. Unfortunately, this book didn’t deliver on that potential for me.  \n\n- **Author’s Effort and Debut Performance:**  \n  The book feels like a good concept that struggled in execution. For a debut author, I think he did alright, but I can’t praise it as highly as some other readers have.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise, its execution fell short for me.

This makes the eventual attempts at emotional resonance unconvincing and too late in the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development and POV Structure:**  \n  The story would have benefited from a different point-of-view structure. Telling the present-day narrative from Joey’s perspective instead of River’s would have created a more parallel and cohesive experience, aligning with the POVs of He Shican in 1740 and Dong Xian in 4 BCE.

There were so many dropped plot lines, metaphors, and references that seemed like they were going to mean something but ended up being just fun little coincidences.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  This is more magical realism than fantasy. There is one major fantastical element, and the rest can be chalked up to some magical realism. The three time periods are heavily based on sex and almost nothing else. I’m supposed to believe this is a romance story that transcends time, but all it really is is “the true feeling” disguised as sex.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were barely fleshed out. I felt like I was still learning about their characters even 90% into the book. There were so many parallels among characters between the timelines that amounted to nothing by the end.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  This book needed to be longer to flesh these things out, but also I’m afraid I would’ve been bored if this book were any longer.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was expecting more… everything, to be honest. More fantasy, more character development, more actual romance. Really disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the prose and cross-timeline referencing were enjoyable, the book fell short in delivering a satisfying plot, character development, and genre expectations.

They loved each other because the book said so. There was very little growth, and then, all of a sudden: a weird forced love triangle! Oh no, a nemesis? No, a love triangle after all! But hate-love or something. Anyway, all of it is fated, nobody had real agency, and feelings just appear out of nowhere with no basis at all.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The other big gripe was the hypersexuality all wrapped up in flowery euphemisms. I don’t mind turning everything sexual at times, but call a spade a spade and a cock a cock. I can also live with flowery euphemisms at times, but only if they are used very sparingly.

The narrative then included victim blaming, as the aggressor pointed out the victim's physical arousal, leading to the victim \"giving in\" and \"admitting\" he secretly wanted it. This was followed by guilt about \"cheating,\" which was not questioned by the narrative. This approach to such a sensitive topic was really disappointing.  \n\n- **Representation of Queer Narratives:**  \n  While the story attempted to explore complex and messy queer narratives, including obsession and love triangles, it failed to do so without resorting to problematic elements like victim blaming.

While this level of explicitness isn’t usually to my taste, it is well-written and fits the fun, bold tone of the story.\n\n- **POV Shift:**  \n  There is a surprising and enjoyable shift in point of view that added an interesting layer to the narrative.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending felt too ambiguous for my liking. While one of the three storylines was wrapped up satisfactorily, the other two left me disappointed and wanting more. It seemed like the story had great potential and development but struggled to find a satisfying conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Emperor and the Endless Palace* is a strong debut by Justinian Huang, showcasing his talent for storytelling and unique writing style. Despite some issues with the ending, the novel’s overlapping narratives, queer representation, and bold tone make it a memorable read. I look forward to seeing more from this author in the future.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe book would likely receive a high rating for its writing and creativity, though the ambiguous ending might slightly lower the overall score."

Anytime she appeared in a scene, I cringed. Additionally, there’s a rapist character, which was unsettling. On the positive side, there’s Calvin, who I really liked.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The flowery language in the sex scenes didn’t work for me. Instead of being sexy, they made me laugh or question my reality.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n  The cover of the book is absolutely beautiful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting concept and a visually appealing cover, the execution fell short for me. The inclusion of disturbing characters like the voyeur grandma and a rapist, along with the awkwardly written sex scenes, detracted from my overall enjoyment. However, Calvin was a bright spot in the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

The introduction of a love triangle subplot further detracts from the overall experience, as I found myself disengaged from the main relationship by that point.

The romance felt unconvincing, with the characters only connecting during sex scenes, which were awkward and unappealing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I had high expectations for this book, especially since it’s a danmei novel set in ancient China with a reincarnation plot, which is my favorite romance trope. I anticipated an emotional slow-burn romance across multiple lives, but the execution fell short of my hopes.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The story is divided into three timelines: one involving an emperor and a clerk in ancient China, another with an innkeeper and a fox spirit in 1700s China, and a modern-day timeline set in LA. While the historical timelines were stronger, the modern timeline felt weak and disjointed.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were shallow and lacked depth, making it hard to connect with them. The main characters (MCs) came across as self-centered and immature, which I found off-putting. Their relationship felt more like infatuated lust than genuine romance, with no believable emotional intimacy.\n\n- **Romance and Intimacy:**  \n  The romance was unconvincing, with the characters only seeming to connect during sex scenes. These scenes were not enjoyable to read, often featuring awkward and unsexy phrases like “he impaled me victoriously,” “blanketing me in his meat,” or “pounded his pink plum.” The lack of emotional depth made it hard to root for their relationship.\n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue felt wooden and unnatural, contributing to the overall lack of engagement with the story. The plot itself felt underdeveloped, more like an idea than a fully realized narrative.\n\n- **Subplots and Pacing:**  \n  The introduction of a love triangle subplot further detracted from my enjoyment, as I was already disengaged from the main relationship by that point. The pacing felt uneven, and the story struggled to maintain my interest.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book includes several heavy themes, such as substance abuse, death, gore, ableism, sexual assault/rape, and cheating, which may be triggering for some readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book did not meet my expectations, primarily due to shallow characters, unconvincing romance, and awkward writing. While the historical timelines showed promise, the modern timeline and overall execution fell flat. I struggled to finish the book and ultimately found myself rooting against the main relationship.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The book is marred by stilted, overly detailed sex scenes that lack emotional depth and connection. Rather than portraying genuine romantic relationships, the characters display instant lust, accompanied by cringe-worthy descriptions. The love triangle spanning three timelines feels shallow and unconvincing, with little meaningful development of relationships or motivations. The characters come across as immature, unlikable, and underdeveloped, often acting randomly and without clear motivations or growth. This lack of depth makes it hard to connect with or care about them. Additionally, the marketing is misleading; the blurb promises a profound exploration of queer love, yet the story presents thoughtless, selfish individuals whose actions lead to abuse, destruction, and death—far from a true representation of love in action.",

While the concept was intriguing, it never fully lived up to its potential. The focus on their sexual relationship overshadowed the romantic connection that was supposed to make their love enduring.\n\n- **Entertainment and Readability:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was easy to read and entertaining. The plot kept me engaged, and I appreciated how it incorporated elements of legitimate Chinese history and literary canon. Learning about terms like \"cut-sleeve\" and their historical context was a highlight for me.\n\n- **Educational Value:**  \n  While it’s not an author’s responsibility to educate readers, I valued the new knowledge I gained from the book. It deepened my understanding of Chinese history and culture, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ themes.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing was inconsistent.

The book could have benefited from a stronger focus on character development and emotional depth.\n\n- **Ending and Character Dynamics:**  \n  The final 5% of the book was deeply disappointing and problematic. The introduction of a third character, whose interactions with one of the main characters were dubiously consensual or outright rapey, ruined the story. The Emperor’s decision to leave his love interest with this third man, treating it as a healthy resolution, was baffling and disturbing. This undermined what could have been a thoughtful subversion of the reincarnation romance trope.\n\n- **Moral and Ethical Implications:**  \n  The portrayal of the ending as a positive development for the characters was troubling. The Emperor’s assumption that his love interest secretly desired the third man, despite the latter’s abusive behavior, was not only illogical but also morally questionable. This left a sour taste and overshadowed the book’s earlier strengths.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had many promising elements—such as its ambitious premise, engaging plot, and educational value—it was ultimately let down by its problematic ending and inconsistent writing quality. The disturbing character dynamics and moral implications in the final chapters overshadowed the book’s potential, leaving me deeply disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nInitially, I would have given the book three stars for its entertainment value and historical insights.

However, I didn’t realize it was tagged as “Romance” until I picked it up. The explicit sexual content from the beginning felt more like explicit fanfiction, where the sex seemed to be the primary focus rather than the plot or character development.\n\n- **Handling of Sexual Content:**  \n  The book includes scenes where servants are commanded to have sex, presented in the same tone as consensual sex scenes. One main character shows no remorse or guilt after a male servant is forced to perform a sexual act on him, and the scene is described in graphic detail. Several other scenes involve dubious consent, portraying most male characters as overly sex-crazed. One character even dies because he prioritizes sex over basic survival, which felt absurd and detracted from the story’s credibility.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The first three-quarters of the book felt mostly atmospheric, with little plot progression. The story suddenly rushed to cram a lot of plot into the final quarter, which felt unbalanced. I suspect the excessive focus on sex and assault scenes may have contributed to this pacing issue.\n\n- **Redeeming Qualities:**  \n  The only redeeming part of the book was the ending, where one of the modern reincarnations of the lovers chooses not to engage with the other. This decision highlighted the destructive nature of their obsession with each other, offering a moment of clarity and growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and a few moments of depth, it was overshadowed by its excessive and problematic handling of sexual content, uneven pacing, and lack of meaningful plot development.

However, the book leaned heavily into explicit sexual content, which was disappointing and not what I expected.  \n\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The book includes numerous sex scenes, some of which were uncomfortable and problematic. Two scenes, in particular, depicted non-consensual acts—one involving a drugged participant and another involving a slave coerced by their owner. These scenes were portrayed in an unsettlingly \"exciting\" manner, which I found deeply troubling.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The story unfolds across three timelines, two of which I found boring and unengaging. I only continued reading to find out what happened in the one timeline that held my interest.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I disliked one of the main characters, who came across as narcissistic and manipulative. I struggled to understand why the other character kept falling in love with them, given their toxic traits.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this M/M fantasy romance fell short of my expectations. The excessive and problematic sexual content, unengaging timelines, and unlikable characters made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "The book unfolds across three timelines: 1740, present-day LA, and 4 BCE. I found the 1740 timeline particularly engaging and compelling. However, the frequent shifts between timelines disrupted the narrative flow, especially when the other timelines leaned heavily on sexualized moments that detracted from the overall plot.",
            "The story excessively sexualizes every significant moment, diminishing the characters' emotions and relationships to mere physical encounters. These interactions are often depicted in a brutal and vulgar way, lacking the romantic or meaningful depth I anticipated. Furthermore, a scene involving characters who appeared to be children left me feeling deeply uncomfortable, as it seemed both inappropriate and unnecessary.",
            "The author's focus on explicit and crude sexual exchanges detracts from the potential for meaningful storytelling. The tone is jarring and inconsistent, especially when contrasted with the more intriguing and nuanced 1740 timeline.",
            "I was excited to receive access to 'The Emperor and the Endless Palace' from Netgalley, especially since I loved Suzanne Weyn's 'Reincarnation,' which explores a similar theme. However, while the premise was promising, the story ultimately lacked the depth and emotional resonance I had hoped for."

        "conclusion": "I began this book with high expectations, drawn by its thematic connection to a story I love. However, the excessive sexualization, disjointed timelines, and uncomfortable scenes made it a disappointing read. While I appreciated the 1740 timeline, the overall execution left me unsatisfied. I likely won’t explore more works from this author.",

I had high hopes for 'The Emperor and the Endless Palace,' but it fell short of my expectations. Despite its promising premise, the story failed to deliver the depth and emotional resonance I anticipated.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The book is divided into three timelines: 1740, present-day LA, and 4 BCE.

These encounters were often portrayed in a brutal and vulgar manner, lacking the romantic or meaningful depth I expected. Additionally, a scene involving characters who seemed to be children left me deeply uncomfortable, as it felt inappropriate and unnecessary.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The author's emphasis on explicit and tasteless sexual exchanges overshadowed any potential for meaningful storytelling.
