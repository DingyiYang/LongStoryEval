Her previous novel, *House of Hollow*, was a favorite, and *The Invocations* lived up to my expectations. Sutherland has a special place in my heart with her wild and deliciously creepy books.\n\n- **Plot and Genre Appeal:**  \n  *The Invocations* is an addictive and amazingly gross read, packed with action and magic.

She embodied each character flawlessly, bringing them to life in an amazing way, regardless of whose POV she was voicing.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  The book contains violence and gore, making it unsuitable for the faint of heart. It’s a dark and intense read, which I personally loved.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a wild, creepy, and utterly captivating novel that solidifies Krystal Sutherland as a must-read author for me.

I felt the characters should have been at least 18, as their struggles and the tone of the book seemed more suited to an older audience.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Creativity:**  \n  - Krystal Sutherland’s creativity and depth of character development impressed me greatly.  \n  - This author is now an auto-buy for me, and I can’t wait to see what she comes up with next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTHE INVOCATIONS is an intense and emotionally engaging novel with well-developed characters, a richly built world, and thought-provoking themes. While the pacing was slow to start and the characters’ ages felt slightly mismatched with the tone, the book’s strengths far outweigh these minor issues. Krystal Sutherland’s storytelling continues to impress, making her an auto-buy author for me. Highly recommended.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded up)."

            "This story is both unique and captivating, with a strong opening that drew me in immediately. Jude's chapter begins in a grotesque yet intriguing manner, instantly capturing my attention. Emer's backstory—her upbringing among demons and her relationship with Bael—adds significant depth to the narrative. The unexpected twists in the final quarter kept me fully engaged throughout.",
            "The three main characters—Emer, Jude, and Zara—are distinct and well-developed. Jude is particularly memorable: a swaggering, unapologetic rebel with a genuine heart. Zara, despite her initial goody-two-shoes demeanor, ultimately reveals a big heart, though she is harder to warm up to. Emer begins as tough and unapproachable, but her traumatic past reveals her as a true badass. Additionally, Bael, Emer's demon protector, adds emotional depth with his complex dynamic.",

            "The magic system is lauded for its creativity and depth, particularly the distinction between soul magic and blood magic and their effects on demons. The idea of invocations inscribed on metal and fused into the skin to forge deals with demons is incredibly compelling. Additionally, the incorporation of Latin and the demons' own language, voces mysticae, enriches the world-building, making it all the more immersive.",
            "This book is a delightfully dark and gruesome read, featuring graphic body horror that will satisfy fans of gory content. Its strong feminist themes and exploration of reclaiming power in a patriarchal society stand out as key strengths. Additionally, the thoughtful inclusion of LGBT representation and the portrayal of trans women within the magic system are commendable elements."

I devoured it within a day and fell in love with the characters and writing style.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The reason this isn’t a full five stars for me is because I wasn’t too keen on the romance aspect. Originally, I thought Jude and Zara were going to be the main couple, and I have to admit I enjoyed their tension a lot more. However, I am glad that Emer and Jude ended up together regardless—I’m a sucker for sapphic slow-burn.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The vibes were awesome, with that same creepy sense of dread and gruesome gore that I initially loved about *House of Hollow*. It is definitely not for the weak-stomached, as it goes into quite a bit of detail in the gory scenes, but in my opinion, that just adds to the beauty of the novel. The atmosphere was on point, exactly the way I’d hoped it would be. It aligned perfectly with each and every scene, casting a spell of emotion and dread.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot:**  \n  The mystery kept me enthralled. I had my suspicions about a certain character since they were introduced, purely based on the process of elimination, but it still made me doubt myself at every turn. I was constantly second-guessing and was honestly surprised when it turned out to be who I thought.  \n\n- **Bonus Content:**  \n  I also loved the *House of Hollow* short story at the end. I’ve been dying for a sequel, and I think this suffices.  \n\n- **Character Appreciation:**  \n  I LOVED JUDE!!!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an incredible read, with a captivating atmosphere, gripping mystery, and well-crafted characters. While the romance subplot wasn’t my favorite, the overall experience was thrilling and satisfying, especially with the bonus short story at the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 (rounded up)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Story:**  \n  The story is a gripping tale of three girls with ties to the occult, each with their own motivations: one trying to raise her sister from the dead, one trying to un-curse herself, and the other a descendant from a long line of witches. Their individual searches bring them together, thrusting them into a serial killer investigation they must solve quickly to avoid becoming victims themselves. The narrative is a fantastic blend of female rage and empowerment, wrapped in a heart-stopping paranormal thriller. It’s Queer, Witchy, and Dark, with hard-hitting discussions on toxic masculinity and female rage. The pacing is excellent, keeping the reader engaged without lulls, and the plot is stunningly dark, almost making one forget it’s a YA novel. The story also includes subtle commentary on how certain religions have historically propped men up over women and demonized women, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Writing:**  \n  Sutherland’s writing style is rich, detailed, and full of wit and cleverness. She creates a vivid atmosphere that immerses the reader, making the plot twists hit hard and leaving a lasting impact. The world-building is seamless, with the concept of magic being introduced naturally and expanded upon as the story unfolds. The suspension of disbelief is easily achieved due to the organic way the magical elements are woven into the narrative.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The three main characters—Jude, Emer, and Zara—are compelling and well-developed. Jude is bold, confident, chaotic, and sarcastic, driving much of the story with her outrageous ideas and solutions. Emer is sweet, caring, and knowledgeable, with a tragic past that has made her empathetic and protective of other women. Zara (or Jones) is smart, calculating, and deeply caring, willing to go to great lengths to right wrongs, even attempting necromancy. Together, they form a powerful trio that embodies female empowerment and drives the story forward.\n\n- **Enjoyment:**  \n  The story is highly enjoyable and memorable, leaving a lasting impression. It’s the kind of book that demands a re-read and resonates deeply with the reader. The narrative is empowering, especially for female-identifying readers, encouraging them to channel their inner strength and hold onto their power in the face of adversity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a dark, witchy, and empowering paranormal thriller that masterfully blends social commentary with a gripping plot. The characters are richly developed, the writing is immersive, and the story is both thought-provoking and entertaining. It’s a must-read for anyone who enjoys tales of female rage, empowerment, and the occult.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- **Overall:** 5🌟  \n- **Story:** 5🌟  \n- **Writing:** 5🌟  \n- **Characters:** 5🌟  \n- **Enjoyment:** 100/10"

            "In this story, Zara Jones is fueled by the profound loss of her sister, Savannah, and her desperate wish to resurrect her. Meanwhile, Jude Wolf, hailing from a wealthy family, battles the torment of a cursed demon deal. Emer, a skilled cursewriter, is consumed by a desire for vengeance against the witch-hunters who massacred her coven. However, the romance between Jude and Emer lacks chemistry, and Emer comes across as the least relatable of the three main characters.",

Additionally, the inclusion of trans women in the narrative is both noted and appreciated.",

They're ruled by bloodlust and greed. The witches, the curses, and the way powers were gained were unique.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  I really liked the undercurrent themes of female rage, feminism, and taking down the men who abuse their power.  \n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  I did predict a couple of the plot twists, but it was still interesting to see everything unfold and for the truth to be revealed.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was just right, and I'm glad that two of the characters FINALLY kissed and admitted their feelings for each other, even if it was in a roundabout, vague way.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is going to be one of my favorite reads of 2024.

            "The plot was both gripping and unsettling, featuring a murderer who could invade your home even with locked doors—thanks to the author, I now have a new fear! The story explored themes of female solidarity and misogyny, adding depth to the narrative. While I anticipated the final twist early due to my knowledge of Russian name etymology (Volkov means \"son of the wolf\"), the climax remained tense and thrilling, keeping me on the edge of my seat.",
            "The three main characters are exceptionally well-crafted and engaging. Zara, the clever and bookish aspiring necromancer, is relatable in her determination. Jude, with her sardonic wit and desperate quest to reverse a demonic bargain that threatens her life, is both tragic and captivating. Emer, the powerful yet lonely witch who creates curses to protect abused women, adds significant depth and emotional weight to the story. Although it takes a while for the three narrators to converge and tackle the conspiracy of deaths, I didn’t mind, as each character is strong enough to sustain their own narrative.",
            "I was captivated by the gruesome and visceral nature of the magic in this book. It felt utterly inhuman, with demons clinging to souls like parasites in exchange for magical gifts that siphon away years or decades of life. The chilling consequences of demonic bargains gone awry left people rotting from the inside out, while their surroundings decayed. The imagery of an orchard bearing spoiled fruit, with trees weeping blood from the bodies of unavenged murder victims buried beneath them, was both repulsive and intriguing. The unpredictable and dangerous magic evoked the classic Hellblazer comics in the best way possible.",
            "This book deepened my appreciation for the author’s work in the folk horror and urban fantasy genres. Her vivid, immersive writing boldly delves into dark and unsettling themes. I sincerely hope she continues to explore this genre."

It felt totally inhuman, with demons latching onto people's souls like parasites in exchange for magic gifts that drain years or decades from their lives. The demonic bargains gone wrong were particularly chilling, causing people to rot from the inside out while the world around them decayed. The imagery of an orchard growing spoiled fruit with the trees weeping blood because the bodies of unavenged murder victims were buried there was both disgusting and fascinating. The magic was unpredictable and dangerous, which reminded me of classic Hellblazer comics in the best possible way.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The three main characters were incredibly well-written and compelling. Zara, the clever and bookish aspiring necromancer, was relatable in her determination. Jude, with her sardonic wit and desperation to reverse a demonic bargain that was killing her, was both tragic and engaging. Emer, the powerful but lonely witch who crafts curses to protect abused women, added depth and emotional resonance to the story. While it took some time for all three narrators to meet and start solving the conspiracy of deaths, I didn’t mind because each character was strong enough to carry their own narrative.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was both compelling and creepy, with a murderer who could follow you home and get into your house even when the doors were locked—thanks to Krystal Sutherland, I now have a brand-new fear! The story also delved into themes of female solidarity and misogyny, which added layers of depth. I did guess the final twist a bit early due to my knowledge of Russian name etymology (Volkov meaning \"son of the wolf\"), but the climax was still tense and exciting, keeping me on the edge of my seat.\n\n- **Genre and Writing Style:**  \n  This book solidified my love for Krystal Sutherland’s work in the folk horror/urban fantasy genre. Her writing is vivid, immersive, and unafraid to explore dark and unsettling themes. I very much hope she continues writing in this genre.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fantastic urban fantasy novel with a gruesome and unpredictable magic system, well-developed characters, and a plot that was both creepy and thought-provoking. Krystal Sutherland has crafted a story that is as unsettling as it is compelling, and I can’t wait to see what she writes next.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I was captivated by the characters from the beginning and quickly became invested in the story's direction. Emer Byrne as the first main perspective surprised me, but her life added an intriguing layer to the mystery surrounding her, fueling my curiosity about her backstory. Zara was the character I connected with the least. While I appreciated her perspective, she often felt closed off and at times like a filler, especially during the more charged moments between Jude and Emer. Eli's rationale for murdering women and stealing invocations was both heartless and disturbing. However, he was a compelling character, and I enjoyed the dynamic he shared with Jude as the two outcast siblings of the Wolf family, even though his actions left me feeling unsettled.",
            "The writing in *Invocations* is vivid and immersive, filled with striking imagery and clever metaphors. I particularly enjoyed the connection on page 19, where a healing lesion whispers demonic language, evoking the sinister whispers of Legion—an impressive play on words. Jude's observation of her estranged family brought to mind elements from *The Umbrella Academy*. Overall, *Invocations* strikes a balance between darkness and humor, with Jude's witty remarks adding to its richness.",

The mystery and magic were exhilarating, particularly the two major plot twists that caught me completely off guard.

Every time I picked it back up, I was lapping it up. I think subconsciously I was taking forever because I wanted to savour it.  \n   - The mystery and magic were exhilarating, especially the two major plot twists that I didn’t see coming until the big reveal.  \n   - The epilogue had me holding back tears. It was a beautiful, fitting, and perfect ending to the story. I felt giddy and melancholy all at once when it was over.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - I adored the characters from the start and was hooked on the direction of the story.  \n   - I wasn’t expecting Emer Byrne as the first main POV, but I enjoyed seeing her life straight away. It added to the elusive mystery surrounding her, and I was eager to discover more about her backstory.  \n   - Zara was the character I least bonded with. While I still loved reading from her perspective, she felt too closed off and sometimes like a filler character, especially during moments where Jude and Emer had chemistry.  \n   - Eli’s rationale for murdering women and stealing invocations was heartless and disgusting. He was a fantastic character, and I loved the dynamic with Jude as the two black sheep siblings of the Wolf family, but his actions left me distraught.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n   - The writing was vivid and saturated in the telling. I had a great time with the imagery and (imagined or not) metaphors speckled throughout.  \n   - On page 19, I liked the connection of the healing lesion whispering demonic language, which reminded me of the evil whisperings of Legion itself. It felt like a clever play on words.  \n   - There’s a scene where Jude observes her estranged family, which greatly reminded me of something from *The Umbrella Academy*.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n   - *Invocations* felt dark, rich, yet funny (especially with Jude’s comments) all at the same time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight to read. The characters were compelling, the writing was vivid and immersive, and the story was filled with exhilarating mystery and magic. The plot twists were unexpected, and the ending was both beautiful and heartbreaking. While I didn’t bond as strongly with Zara, the dynamic between Jude and Emer, as well as the complexity of Eli’s character, kept me deeply engaged. I savoured every moment of this book, and it left me feeling a mix of giddiness and melancholy when it was over.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her writing is unique, striking a balance between suspense, horror, and magic with romance, comedy, and reality. Her relationships and dialogues are believable, reflecting the imperfections of real-life relationships.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The book features three women with four-letter names, each given enough depth, knowledge, personality, and backstory to make them distinct from one another. I appreciated the nod to her previous work in this aspect.\n\n- **Horror and Suspense Elements:**\n   - The demons in the book are positively the stuff of nightmares, comparable to Lovecraftian monsters. They were grotesque and vividly depicted, leaving a lasting impression. Some scenes featuring the demons will stick with me forever, to the point where I’m borderline traumatized.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**\n   - At points, the book felt a bit of a slog. However, once the three ladies teamed up for their mission, the story became an exciting adventure. The twist was partially predictable, but there was a component I didn’t see coming, which left me with a tingly feeling and my jaw on the floor.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book left a strong emotional impact, with very few books leaving me with the same feeling. I am excited to see what Ms. Sutherland does next.\n\n- **Recommendations:**\n   - If you liked this book, I would also recommend *The Power* by Naomi Alderman.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMs. Sutherland’s ability to blend suspense, horror, and magic with romance and reality makes her a standout author.

The motivations of the three main characters intertwine seamlessly, leading to an explosive climax. The epilogue is particularly sweet. Jude, Zara, and Emer—three young women—are drawn together by their desperate needs. Jude has cursed herself and seeks to heal her necrotic soul, while Zara is determined to resurrect her brutally murdered sister. Emer, a curse writer accompanied by her horde of demons, may hold the key to their salvation. However, they must first confront a more pressing threat: a serial killer targeting witches and Emer's former clients. The story unfolds in third-person limited perspective, capturing the viewpoints of these three women in a classic fantasy quest format, but told in present tense.",
            "This book features a dark, feminist, and inclusive magic system centered on tethering demons to women's souls, which I found captivating. Like the best magic systems, it comes with a cost and a clear set of rules. The author cleverly uses Zara—affectionately referred to as 'Jones' by Jude—as a character who is uneducated about magic, allowing for a seamless explanation of these intricate concepts to the reader."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The Invocations is a brilliantly crafted modern occult fantasy with a feminist twist, featuring a dark and inclusive magic system, compelling characters, and an explosive, mind-blowing climax. It is highly recommended for fans of the genre and stands out as one of the best reads of the year.",

Their motives are so raw that I can’t even blame them for the messed-up things they do.  \n   - I am convinced Sutherland writes the most unhinged female characters, and I will forever be here for it.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - I listened to this as an audiobook and could have sworn on the life of my firstborn that the narrator was saying \"Emma\" not \"Emer.\"  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n   - I think about *House of Hollow* on a daily basis, and if I could, I would mainline it into the veins of my eyeballs. I was really excited to read this, and while I believe nothing will hold a candle to the glory of *House of Hollow*, this is a pretty great second.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Quality:**  \n   - Sutherland’s writing is ALWAYS 10/10.  \n   - I rarely enjoy modern witch stories, but I knew Sutherland could do it, and *drum roll* SHE DID!  \n\n- **Themes and Quotes:**  \n   - Quotes like, “There was little that escaped her understanding if she threw herself into it,” and “Even the devil does not trust men to honor a bargain, so it does not deal with them,” stood out to me.  \n   - The line, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time,” resonated deeply, especially as it’s a Maya Angelou quote.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - I just want to keep adding more points elaborating on how good this book is, and how good Sutherland is, but that would be a waste of your time when you could be reading this book (or any of her books).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a fantastic addition to Sutherland’s body of work. While it may not surpass *House of Hollow* in my heart, it comes incredibly close. The characters are raw and unhinged, the writing is impeccable, and the themes are thought-provoking. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark, witchy stories with complex characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Writing: 10/10  \n- Characters: 10/10  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 9/10"

Her inner turmoil is palpable, filled with anger and fear, as if flames and thunder rage within her.",

They showcased Sutherland’s ability to create distinct, tangible characters. For example:  \n  - “Once, Jude was practically a princess, the spoiled daughter of a very rich man. Now she is walking nuclear fallout in the form of a girl.”  \n  - “She is the embodiment of autumn with a touch of hell thrown in for a bit of excitement.”  \n  - “Emer burns with anger and fear.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Genre Execution:**  \n  Krystal delivers an engaging plot filled with magic, mystery, and horror. The body gore is exceptionally well-done, described as sick, twisted, and gripping. The novel is a standout example of young adult fantasy horror.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The strong female leads are a highlight of the story. However, Jude receives the most personality development, while Emer and Zara feel underdeveloped. Zara, in particular, seems left behind, especially when the romance subplot is introduced.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance subplot feels somewhat squeezed in and detracts from the overall character dynamics, particularly for Zara.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some uneven character development and a rushed romance subplot, the novel is a fantastic example of young adult fantasy horror. Krystal’s ability to craft a gripping, magical, and horrifying story shines through, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

It’s every bit as thrilling, well-written, original, and female-centered as *House of Hollow*.\n\n- **Opening and Tone:**\n   - The first line of the prologue, \"A girl walks home alone at night,\" perfectly sets up the book.

The main characters—Jude, Emer, and Zara—are each unique, with powerful voices and distinct perspectives on the unfolding events. I was equally invested in all their journeys and happy with every POV change, which is rare for me.\n\n- **Themes and Appeal:**\n   - Similar to *The Power* but written in a more accessible (and queer) way for young adults, *The Invocations* will appeal to lovers of feminist fiction and strong character development. It’s spine-chilling, engaging, and at times humorous, making it a brilliant novel that will stay with me for a long time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Invocations* is a masterfully crafted novel that combines eerie realism, gothic fantasy, and strong feminist themes.

It was dark, gory, and horrifying in all the best ways, yet also full of humor, emotion, and gusto. Right from the prologue, the tone was set, evoking chills and anticipation of darkness and danger.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story served as a powerful metaphor for the inner strength and struggles of women, emphasizing taking back power, rejecting victimhood, and embracing inner demons. It portrayed the age-old societal problems between men and women, with a \"bite back\" narrative that rejects the perception of women as weak playthings for men seeking power.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The trio of Emer, Jude, and Zara were fierce, flawed, and feral females—queens in their own right. They were powerful witches with personal inner (and outer) demons, each embodying courage, beauty, and strength. Their unique voices, personalities, and backstories of loss, grief, struggle, and loneliness made them vividly vicious and relatable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story was a slow burn with a gloriously fiery ending that kept blazing. It was intense, irresistible, and incredible, with a driving force that propelled the narrative forward.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel evoked high emotions, with a knockout punch of a message: \"We will not go down without a fight!\" It carried a strong \"We are the weirdos, Mister\" vibe, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a spellbinding, ferocious, and no-holds-barred story that combines darkness, humor, and emotion to deliver a powerful message about female empowerment and resilience. It’s a vivid, intense, and unforgettable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "While certain plot elements were predictable, the high tension kept me thoroughly engaged. The pacing was excellent, maintaining my interest from start to finish.",
            "The story revolves around three main characters: Emer, a witch haunted by her dark past; Jude, the cursed daughter of a billionaire slowly succumbing to decay; and Zara, who seeks the truth behind her sister's gruesome murder. While multiple perspectives can be risky, I found Emer and Jude to be my favorites, though I appreciated all the characters. Each was layered and unique, contributing significantly to the dynamic among the trio. Their individual traumas intertwined beautifully, and I enjoyed witnessing their connections despite their pain. The sapphic romance was charming, well-developed, and a joy to follow, with believable and engaging chemistry between the characters.",
            "I was captivated by the dark runic magic system. The idea of binding a demon to your soul as a mutual contract, rather than a mere power grab, adds depth to the relationship between humans and demons. This unique approach leads to a resolution that I found particularly satisfying. The author skillfully intertwines themes of power and sacrifice, highlighting the lengths to which the powerless must go to survive. Overall, the magic system seamlessly enhances the story's themes.",

I devoured it in one day!  \n\n- **Characters and Dynamics:**  \n  The story centers around three main characters: Emer, a witch with a dark past coming back to haunt her; Jude, the slowly rotting cursed daughter of a billionaire; and Zara, who is searching for the truth behind her sister's grisly murder.

The chemistry between the characters was believable and engaging.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  I loved the dark runic magic system. The concept of binding a demon to your soul is fascinating, and I appreciated the unique idea that it is a contract for both sides, not a leash used to steal power. This creates an intriguing relationship with the demons, culminating in a resolution I really loved. Sutherland combined power and sacrifice perfectly, illustrating what those without power must do to survive. The magic system blends excellently with the themes woven throughout the story.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  I really appreciate how Sutherland handled the social commentary. It is apparent and central to the book but never feels too heavy-handed or repetitive. The use of demon magic and runes effectively brings attention to real societal problems.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  Some parts of the plot were somewhat predictable, but the tension was high enough that I enjoyed watching it play out regardless.

The narrative skillfully weaves supernatural elements into a murder mystery, creating a captivating experience.

Each character is well-developed, and their struggles and growth drive the narrative forward.",

I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of horror and feminist themes. This gruesome mystery-horror hybrid is not for the faint of heart, featuring body horror, necromancy, and plenty of gore. It’s a dark, intense read that captivated me from the beginning. Much like *House of Hollow*, it skillfully intertwines horror and mystery, emphasizing the grotesque and unsettling."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Content/Trigger Warnings:**  \n  Mentions of stalking, murder, blood and gore, human decay and rot, necromancy, genocide, privilege (monetary and gender), demons, suicide, emotional/mental abuse, neglect, child abandonment, ritual self-harm, and ritual killing.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was extremely excited to read this novel, especially after enjoying Sutherland's other YA book, *House of Hollow*. I saved it for October due to its witchy theme and Halloween opening. I hoped for a story filled with feminine rage, vengeance, a dark atmosphere, and complex characters.  \n\n- **Criticism: Unnecessary Romance:**  \n  While I appreciate sapphic romances, the one in this book felt rushed and unnecessary. It seemed to go from no attraction to \"forever\" too quickly, possibly resembling trauma bonding, but it didn’t resonate with me. If a romance is included, it should feel meaningful and well-integrated into the story.  \n\n- **Praise: The Writing:**  \n  Sutherland’s writing is always a standout. Her style, atmosphere, and sentence crafting are impeccable. She creates an eerie, spooky tone that perfectly complements the plot. Some phrases are stunning, clichés are avoided, and every word feels purposeful.  \n\n- **Praise: The Atmosphere:**  \n  The atmosphere is dark, thrilling, chilling, and creepy—perfect for spooky season. Sutherland captures the fear women feel in the dark and the anger when targeted. Each scene’s atmosphere is meticulously crafted, making it easy to imagine the ideal reading setting from the very first sentence.  \n\n- **Praise: Emer (Main Character):**  \n  Emer is my favorite protagonist. Her love for women, dedication to protecting the vulnerable, and her thirst for vengeance make her a compelling character. She’s powerful, smart, and in control of her life, serving as a great foil to the other characters. She’s a role model for young girls, embodying strength and independence.  \n\n- **Praise: The Magic System:**  \n  The magic system feels fresh and unique. I enjoyed learning its rules, limitations, and applications. It’s refreshing to see spells not confined to Latin, adding a layer of originality to the story.  \n\n- **Praise: The Plot:**  \n  Sutherland doesn’t shy away from darkness. The story is gruesome, horrific, and unapologetically intense, which enhances its impact. The mystery kept me engaged until the end, and the plot delivered on the darkness promised in the synopsis.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a fantastic read for spooky season, offering a dark, moody, and atmospheric experience with beautiful yet gruesome writing. It’s a great choice for those who want to see girls express their anger and frustration. With this book, Sutherland has solidified her place as one of my auto-buy authors.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nTrue Rating: 5/5 Stars"

            "While the ending twists were somewhat predictable, the convergence of the three protagonists' plotlines in the climax was both impressive and engaging. The seamless intertwining of their stories softened the impact of the predictability, making it a more satisfying experience overall.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed all three protagonists and found their motivations compelling. Zara, Jude, and Emer each played distinct roles, with none feeling superfluous to the story. Zara's personal quest to prove that magic is real particularly resonated with me; her willingness to abandon everything for this goal felt deeply relatable. Although Zara might be perceived as a third wheel in Jude and Emer's romance, she remained essential to the plot.",
            "The writing style in chapter one is direct and employs a third-person present tense, effectively conveying essential information. Key character details are presented seamlessly, providing an immediate understanding of their personalities and circumstances. A particularly striking moment is the casual mention of Emer murdering someone's husband, which adds significant depth to the narrative.",
            "I was captivated by the magic system, especially how each cursewriter crafts their invocations with distinct linguistic nuances. The mechanics of applying these invocations to specific body parts were intriguing. The seamless integration of magic into a contemporary setting raised few questions, grounding the story in real-world UK locations and modern elements like TikTok and Covid, firmly placing it in 2024. These references enhanced the authenticity of the setting without feeling overwhelming.",
            "This book explores themes of women reclaiming power through magic in response to male oppression. Unlike *Society for Soulless Girls*, *The Invocations* approaches these themes with a more solemn and intimate tone, immersing readers in the protagonists' struggles from the outset. It delves into the pervasive issue of men abusing power for personal gain.",
            "I began reading the book on its release day and was so captivated that the only thing preventing me from finishing it in two sittings was my sleepiness. From the very first page, it had me hooked and never let go."

        "conclusion": "*The Invocations* is a deeply engaging novel with a fascinating magic system, strong themes of empowerment, and well-developed characters.

While some twists were predictable, the convergence of the protagonists’ stories in the climax was masterfully executed.

            "The story features unexpected plot twists that elicit visceral reactions from the characters. I enjoyed the unique group of girls brought together to confront the tragedies affecting those who believed they were safe, unaware of their shared fate and the lurking killer.",
            "Initially, I found Jude to be my least favorite character, but her growth throughout the story elevated her to my second favorite. I appreciated her sharp wit. Zara resonated with me deeply, reflecting a version of myself had I lost a sister; her unwavering denial of her sister's absence was particularly poignant. Emer emerged as my favorite character, carrying a heartbreaking backstory yet still striving to support those in need. A special mention goes to Bael—his significance becomes clear by the end of the book.",
            "This book's unique blend of witch and demon elements was refreshing and unlike anything I've encountered before. I particularly enjoyed the nod to *Sabrina the Teenage Witch*—the second series, which I adored. The quote, “Men do not know what it feels like to be hunted. Men do not walk alone on dark streets and think about fingers closing around their throats or their skulls thudding dully against the pavement,” struck a profound chord with me."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Jude was my least-liked character initially, but her growth throughout the book put her at number two. She gets extra points for her snark.  \n  - Zara felt like reading a version of myself in a book (had I lost a sister), and I loved that. Her dogged refusal to accept that her sister is really gone was something else entirely.  \n  - Emer was my favorite. She has a brutally tragic backstory, but she’s still there, doing the most she can for those who need her help.  \n  - A special shoutout to Bael – once you get to the end of this book, it will make sense.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - There were a few plot twists I didn’t see coming, and the characters’ reactions to them were visceral.  \n  - I loved this odd assortment of girls thrown together to solve the tragedies befalling girls and women who thought they were safe, not realizing they were intertwined by fate and by a killer.  \n\n- **Themes and World-Building:**  \n  - The witch and demon aspect of this book was really cool and not something I had seen before.  \n  - I definitely chuckled at the reference to *Sabrina the Teenage Witch* – the second one, not the first. LOVED that show.  \n  - The quote, “Men do not know what it feels like to be hunted. Men do not walk alone on dark streets and think about fingers closing around their throats or their skulls thudding dully against the pavement,” resonated deeply.  \n\n- **Potential for Sequels/Prequels:**  \n  - Just like *House of Hollow*, this book COULD have a sequel – heck, even a prequel, and I would devour it. I hope that it does.  \n\n- **Author and Publisher Appreciation:**  \n  - While reading her first book put her on my auto-buy list, *The Invocations* just cemented her place there.  \n  - A huge thank you to Nancy Paulsen Books (Penguin) + NetGalley for the opportunity to read an egalley of my most anticipated book so far this year and again to the publisher for a gifted physical copy.  \n  - I am beyond excited to receive my physical edition from B&N twofold now. All opinions in this review are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and unique story with well-developed characters, unexpected twists, and a fresh take on witches and demons. The emotional depth, thematic resonance, and potential for future stories make it a standout read. The author has solidified her place on my auto-buy list, and I eagerly await more from her.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s the most incredible book I’ve ever read, and I knew early on that it was something I was deeply interested in.\n\n- **Narrative Voice and Writing Style:**  \n  The narrative voice was strong, beautiful, and incredibly well-executed. The writing style captivated me, and the way the story was told added so much depth to the experience.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were so relatable and alive. They felt real and multidimensional, which made the story even more engaging. Jude’s characterization, in particular, stood out, especially how her lesbian identity was woven into the feminist themes without being the sole focus.\n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book didn’t shy away from grotesque and shocking elements, almost bordering on body horror. These moments were terrifyingly beautiful and created vivid mental images that stayed with me. The feminist themes were heavy but well-integrated, and the Sapphic romance, though a minor subplot, was beautifully done and brought me a lot of joy.\n\n- **Emotional Impact and Personal Connection:**  \n  This book resonated with me on a deep level. It toppled my previous favorite book of all time, *Carry On* by Rainbow Rowell, after seven years. The emotional highs and lows, combined with the themes and characters, made it an unforgettable read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a masterpiece. From its strong narrative voice and relatable characters to its bold themes and beautiful romance, it’s the best book I’ve ever read. It’s exciting to have a new favorite after so many years.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n10/10, 5⭐️"

While I was correct about the twists, I found the ending to be both wholesome and satisfying, particularly with its acknowledgment of the women who were killed for being witches and their eventual vengeance.

She presents her nuanced protagonists slowly, unraveling their intricacies with each chapter while also placing careful clues of their ultimate potential.  \n\n- **Feminist Themes and Representation:**  \n  Sutherland’s feminist horror writing is a much-needed respite from the constant flood of narratives that not only fail the Bechdel test but also lack relatability when it comes to experiencing trauma firsthand.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book explicitly states its trans-inclusivity within the narrative. This small but significant detail made a world of difference to me.  \n\n- **Social Commentary and Themes:**  \n   - This book is unapologetically bold in its social commentary. It holds up a mirror to society, reflecting the lived experiences of women, girls, and anyone perceived as femme. The messaging is not subtle, but that was clearly intentional, and it resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - Overall, I had a positive experience with the book. There were many satisfying moments and unexpected twists that kept me engaged. However, I felt the story could have ventured into slightly darker territory, which would have added more depth.  \n\n- **Potential for a Sequel:**  \n   - The ending left a door slightly open for a potential sequel. I’m hopeful that a follow-up could deliver the \"women's wrongs\" narrative that many readers, including myself, are eager to see.  \n\n- **Reader Experience and Recommendations:**  \n   - I highly recommend this book, but I urge readers to be mindful of potential triggers before diving in. It’s a powerful and thought-provoking read that will likely evoke strong emotions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its inclusivity, bold social commentary, and engaging plot.

Emer, a witch herself, possesses the knowledge of magic and has a troubling link to the victims, all of whom were her clients.",

            "The setting is captivating, immersing readers in a world steeped in witchcraft and demons. I especially appreciated the depiction of the demons—vaguely humanoid yet feral, they feed on blood and souls, serving as the source of the witches' powers. The witches' willingness to sell their souls to these demons, without attempting to justify their actions, adds a compelling layer of realism and darkness to the narrative.",

The blurb looked incredibly promising—WITCHES! DEMONS! WITCH HUNTERS! LESBIANS!—but I've been burned before, so I approached it cautiously.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows three very different girls who are pulled together because they are all linked to women being murdered. Zara's sister was the first victim, and Zara is searching for magic to resurrect her. Jude, who has money to bribe the police, is looking for a skilled witch to fix the magic she performed on herself while investigating these witch-related crimes. Emer, a witch, knows how to perform magic, and all the victims have been her clients.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are amazing and distinct. Jude is spoiled and butch, Emer is wild and taciturn, and Zara is bookish and type A. Their personalities and dynamics add depth to the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  The setting is fantastic, with a rich focus on witchcraft and demons. I particularly loved the portrayal of the demons—vaguely humanoid but feral, feeding on literal blood and souls, and serving as the source of witches' powers. The fact that the witches sell their souls to these demons without trying to justify why they aren't damned adds a layer of realism and darkness to the world.  \n\n- **Themes and Enjoyment:**  \n  I love witchcraft, especially when it’s tied to demons, and this book delivered on that front. The demons and their connection to the witches' powers were a highlight for me. The story kept me engaged, and I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its compelling plot, well-developed characters, and immersive world-building.

However, the villains, especially the aristocratic witch hunters, feel underdeveloped, relying too much on the trope of wealthy male societies harboring secret animosity toward women, which renders them hollow. Nonetheless, the book is queer, witchy, and anti-patriarchy, embodying everything I desire in a YA novel and more. Its exploration of queer identity and its intersection with femininity and rage adds significant depth and resonance.",

The contrast between everyday life—like ordering sushi—and grotesque rituals, such as retrieving swollen corpses from a stagnant lake, creates a uniquely evocative atmosphere.",

The theme of female rage is central, approached with a fearless tone that is refreshingly rare in YA literature, making it particularly compelling."

It’s a style I loved in \"House of Hollow\" and found even more impressive in \"The Invocations.\"\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The book is creepy and even more gruesome than \"House of Hollow,\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. The atmosphere is immersive and perfectly suited to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery at the heart of the story is engaging and thrilling, revolving around a serial killer targeting witches. It kept me hooked from start to finish.\n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Unlike \"House of Hollow,\" where I was slightly let down by the ending, \"The Invocations\" completely delivers. The conclusion was satisfying and well-executed.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I found myself more invested in the characters in this book compared to the author’s previous work. They were compelling and added depth to the story.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  I loved the inclusion of body horror, queerness, and witchiness. These elements were seamlessly woven into the narrative and enriched the overall experience.\n\n- **Anticipation for Future Work:**  \n  I’m blown away by this book and can’t wait to see what Sutherland writes next. I’m also eager to get my hands on the Illumicrate/Evernight edition.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Invocations\" exceeded my already high expectations, surpassing \"House of Hollow\" in almost every way. With its stunning writing, gripping mystery, satisfying ending, and rich themes, this book is a standout. I loved every aspect of it and am eagerly anticipating the author’s next work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  - The story revolves around three main characters: Zara, who wants to resurrect her murdered sister to express her love; Jude, who struggles with chronic demonic pain and body horror (her leg is rotting, and she smells like decay and sulphur); and Emer, a homeless witch seeking revenge for her family's murder and aiming to protect wronged women.  \n  - The plot includes a nightmarish serial killer, elements reminiscent of the movie *Ready or Not*, and a sweet sapphic romance.  \n  - The reviewer expresses a desire for a series where the girls build a coven and go after witch hunters, likening them to a witchy version of the Powerpuff Girls (Jude as Buttercup, Zara as Bubbles, and Emer as Blossom).  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - The male characters are notably unlikable, with Jude's dad (described as an elderly billionaire version of Leonardo DiCaprio) being the \"best\" one, which the reviewer finds problematic.  \n  - The female protagonists, however, are compelling and well-developed, each with distinct motivations and personalities.  \n\n- **Tone and Warnings:**  \n  - The book contains body horror elements, including graphic descriptions of Jude's condition.  \n  - The reviewer highlights the lack of likable male characters as a notable aspect of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is the reviewer's favorite YA read of the year so far, thanks to its unique blend of dark themes, compelling female protagonists, and a sapphic romance. The reviewer is enthusiastic about the potential for a series featuring the characters building a coven and taking on witch hunters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores are mentioned in the review."

            "This book wonderfully features lesbians and includes trans women in its women-only magic system, which I find fantastic and adds a unique touch to the demons. However, it lacks diversity beyond female and queer representation. Given that the story centers on feminine rage, it would have been beneficial to see more representation of people of color. That said, the main cast is endearing, and the narrative is well-crafted.",
            "The story explores the theme of feminine rage, presenting it as both powerful and compelling.",

In a book centered on feminine rage, it would have been nice to see more POC representation.  \n\n- **Characters and Storytelling:**  \n  - The main cast is incredibly lovable, and the story is well-crafted.  \n  - The way the story unfolds made it impossible to stop reading.

Each character had been hurt by men and sought power in a world that denies it to women.\n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**\n   - In *House of Hollow*, certain plot points felt like they were added to enhance the mystery rather than being integral to it.\n   - The mystery in *The Invocations* was tight and well-constructed, with concrete clues that fit together nicely. However, it was relatively easy to solve for readers familiar with mystery fantasy.\n\n- **Magic System and World-Building:**\n   - The magic system in *The Invocations* was fresh, otherworldly, and easy to grasp. It included terrifying demons and the concept of equivalent exchange (girls gain powers to protect themselves, demons gain food).\n   - The demons were unique, differing from traditional horned devils, and were not portrayed as mere parasites.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**\n   - *The Invocations* evoked strong feelings of feminist rage and empowerment, making it a powerful read for those seeking such themes.\n   - The body horror elements, particularly Jude’s curse, were visceral and impactful.\n\n- **Comparison Between Books:**\n   - *House of Hollow* was the reader’s first horror book and, while enjoyable, didn’t fully captivate them. The updated short story in the Barnes & Noble edition, however, significantly improved their appreciation of *House of Hollow* by providing context and explanations for previously confusing elements, such as Grey’s obsession with witchcraft.\n\n- **Spoiler-Related Insights:**\n   - The short story revealed that *House of Hollow* and *The Invocations* exist in the same universe, which added depth to Grey’s character and her actions in *House of Hollow*.

Overall, the reader highly recommends *The Invocations* for its fresh magic system, compelling characters, and feminist themes.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- *House of Hollow*: Enjoyable but not fully captivating.\n- *The Invocations*: Amazing, with high praise for its plot, magic system, and themes."

Zara seeks a spell to resurrect her murdered sister, Jude is searching for an invocation to fix her necrotic soul after a demon deal goes wrong, and Emer creates invocations to empower women. Their paths cross as they investigate the murders of women who previously bore Emer’s invocations, forcing them to work together to stop the killer before one of them becomes the next victim.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  Krystal Sutherland’s writing is captivating, with a gorgeously creepy atmosphere that stands out. Her ability to create a dark, immersive world is unparalleled, and it’s one of the reasons I love her work.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The novel is full of feminine rage, witchy vibes, and saucy sapphic flirtations, which are elements I deeply enjoy in a story. The themes of empowerment, magic, and female solidarity resonate strongly throughout the book.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters are complex yet likeable, each with their own motivations and struggles. Their dynamic as a trio is compelling, and their individual journeys add depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Anticipation:**  \n  As a fan of Sutherland’s previous work, *House of Hollow*, I was eagerly awaiting *The Invocations*. It lived up to my high expectations and reminded me why I adore her storytelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a spellbinding novel that combines a gripping plot, rich atmosphere, and themes of magic and female empowerment. It’s a book packed with everything I love, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The witchcraft depicted is dark, gruesome, and unsettling, creating an atmosphere that makes you fear the shadows in your own room.  \n  - It’s not a lighthearted or romantic take on magic; instead, it’s intense and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  - This book is a must-read for women, as it speaks directly to their experiences and struggles.  \n  - Non-binary readers may also find the story relatable and impactful.  \n  - However, it may not resonate with men who dismiss feminist narratives, such as those who found *Barbie* pointless.  \n\n- **Writing and Authenticity:**  \n  - The writing feels so authentic and immersive that it almost seems as if the author, Krystal Sutherland, was directly informed by a witch about the true nature of magic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a groundbreaking feminist novel that uses dark, unsettling witchcraft as a lens to critique misogyny and societal structures. It’s a must-read for women and non-binary individuals, offering a powerful and immersive experience. However, it may not appeal to those who dismiss feminist narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThanks to PENGUIN GROUP and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

This is a personal pet peeve and doesn't impact the overall plot or characters.\n\n- **Overall Experience:**\n   - The book is a fun, sapphic, witchy read that successfully captures themes of female rage and \"eat-the-rich\" energy, tailored for a teen audience.\n   - It includes memorable scenes that linger in the mind long after reading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a well-crafted YA novel that effectively channels themes of female empowerment and rebellion. While it has some predictable elements and a personal critique regarding historical references, it remains an engaging and atmospheric read, particularly for its intended audience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review."

            "The story unfolds through the perspectives of Zara Jones, Jude Wolf, and Emer, with chapters blending their viewpoints seamlessly. This technique effectively intertwines their narratives, especially as they converge. The final 100 pages are particularly gripping, with the plot accelerating dramatically. Although the story's trajectory is somewhat predictable, this predictability enhances the tension and foreboding atmosphere, culminating in an intensely powerful conclusion.",
            "In this gripping tale, Zara Jones is determined to use magic to resurrect her deceased sister, while Jude Wolf, a billionaire's daughter, grapples with a dark curse. Emer, an orphan, crafts curses to bind demons and empower witches. Their distinct struggles intertwine as they unite to confront a serial killer targeting witches, creating a compelling and well-developed narrative.",
            "The writing in *The Invocations* remains strong, though it is less prose-heavy than the author's previous work, *House of Hollow*. This change is understandable, given the expansive scope of the story, which allows for less detailed reflection.",
            "The book draws significant inspiration from the 2021 murder of Sarah Everard, delving into the everyday fears women encounter and the men who exploit their power and privilege to prey on them. This theme is central to the narrative, adding depth and resonance to the story.",
            "While categorized as YA and featuring 17-year-old protagonists, the characters and themes resonate strongly with older readers (18-20). The story transcends its YA label, and the characters' age does not diminish its appeal."

With its strong themes, well-crafted characters, and intense pacing, it kept me hooked until the very end.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing in \"The Invocations\" is still very good, though it feels less prose-heavy compared to Sutherland's previous work, \"House of Hollow.\" This shift makes sense given the amount of ground the story needs to cover, leaving less room for detailed rumination.\n\n- **Themes and Motivation:**  \n  The book is heavily influenced by the 2021 murder of Sarah Everard, exploring the everyday fears women face and the men who exploit their power and privilege to prey upon them. This theme is central to the narrative and adds depth to the story.\n\n- **Narrative Structure and POV:**  \n  The story is told through three points of view (Zara Jones, Jude Wolf, and Emer), but the chapters are not explicitly differentiated by POV. This approach works well, as it seamlessly weaves the characters' stories together once they meet.\n\n- **Characters and Their Arcs:**  \n  Zara Jones is desperate to use magic to bring her dead sister back, Jude Wolf is a billionaire's daughter cursed with a dark fate, and Emer is an orphan who writes curses to bind demons and grant witches power. Their individual struggles and eventual collaboration to stop a serial killer targeting witches are compelling and well-developed.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The final 100 pages are particularly gripping, with the plot accelerating like a rocket. While the story's direction was somewhat predictable, this predictability heightened the tension and foreboding atmosphere, making the ending act incredibly intense.\n\n- **Target Audience and Age Appropriateness:**  \n  Although categorized as YA and featuring protagonists around 17 years old, the characters and themes could easily resonate with older readers (18-20). The story doesn't feel limited by its YA label, and the age of the characters doesn't detract from its appeal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Invocations\" is a thrilling and thought-provoking novel that delivers on its promise. With its strong themes, well-crafted characters, and intense pacing, it kept me hooked until the very end. The book's exploration of power, privilege, and fear is both timely and impactful, and the open-ended conclusion leaves room for potential follow-ups.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story's bloody, gory, and creepy elements enhance its overall engagement. However, the romance between Jude and Emer feels stilted and unnatural; a more subtle development would have been preferable, allowing it to evolve into something meaningful in the epilogue rather than being forced into the main narrative.",
            "Zara was a compelling protagonist, and her character development, especially her willingness to open up to others by the end, was deeply satisfying. Emer added an intriguing layer to the story, enhancing its depth. However, Jude felt underdeveloped and unrelatable; her preoccupation with wealth and a return to her privileged lifestyle diminished her overall appeal."

While the romance subplot felt forced and Jude’s character was less compelling, the story’s dark, creepy atmosphere and well-executed twists made it a fun and engaging read.",

Zara, mourning her sister Savannah, a victim of a serial killer, is determined to bring her back, even if it means resorting to dark magic. Emer, a spell seller, becomes crucial in helping Jude and Zara uncover the identity of the killer targeting women. The narrative skillfully intertwines a serial killer mystery with themes of witchcraft, offering a fresh and modern perspective on witches and female rage.

However, I read it too quickly and wish I had taken more time for a deeper exploration; I plan to revisit the last 150 pages.

The book avoids the \"bury your gays\" trope, which is appreciated.\n\n- **Expansion of the Sutherland Universe:**\n   - I enjoyed learning more about the world and the creepy elements, which leave potential for more novels or even crossovers with House of Hollow.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The book flows well with no dull moments, but I read it too quickly and wish I had taken more time for a deeper read. I plan to re-read the last 150 pages.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The three perspectives often smothered the narrative, and not all characters received full arcs. The book might have benefited from fewer perspectives.\n   - Some characters fell into trope stereotypes rather than being fully realized individuals.\n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**\n   - The reveal and ending didn’t have the same emotional impact as House of Hollow. The ending wrapped up happily for two characters but felt miffed for the third.\n   - I missed the ambiguity and mystery of House of Hollow’s ending, which left a stronger emotional tug.\n\n- **Humor and Modern References:**\n   - The humor and modern references often felt cringe and out of place, especially TikTok mentions, which didn’t feel authentic for 17-year-old characters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, Sutherland’s novel is a feminist, queer, and horror masterpiece with strong vibes and excellent prose. However, it falls short in character development and emotional impact compared to House of Hollow. The humor and modern references were a miss, but the romance and world-building were highlights. A slower, more in-depth read is needed to fully appreciate it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5/5 (Goodreads needs a 10-star scale for more nuanced ratings)."

She’s intelligent and observant but faces abandonment from the women in her life.  \n   - Jude’s loneliness is a slow, gradual process, while Emer’s loneliness hits her early in life, shaping her into a streetwise and hardened young witch.  \n   - The found family trope is beautifully executed, and I love how the girls come together to form their own tribe.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is solid and enjoyable, though slightly predictable.  \n   - The pacing starts slow but picks up as the story progresses, making for an engaging read.  \n\n- **Themes and Feminist Undertones:**  \n   - The book is unapologetically feminine, with strong feminist vibes that resonate deeply.  \n   - It addresses themes of misogyny and the historical persecution of women, particularly through the lens of witch burnings.  \n   - The feminist message is powerful and in-your-face, much like Queen Latifah’s *U.N.I.T.Y.*  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - While I typically prefer no romance, the romantic elements in this book are minimal and subtle, making them tolerable.  \n\n- **Concept of Witchcraft:**  \n   - The portrayal of witchcraft is phenomenal and one of my favorite aspects of the book.  \n   - Witches are created through agreements and contracts with demons, and there’s no distinction between “good” and “bad” witches—just witches fighting against misogyny.  \n   - The inclusion of demons adds depth to the story, highlighting the lengths women must go to protect themselves.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a steady and solid novel that explores themes of loneliness, found family, and feminism through the lens of witchcraft.

            "The book employs a third-person perspective for each of the three main characters—Emer, Jude, and Zara—allowing readers to easily follow their individual narratives despite the absence of chapter headers. I appreciated this approach, as it effectively handles multiple viewpoints. The mystery unfolds with well-executed twists that feel organic and seamlessly integrated into the plot. However, my immersion was occasionally disrupted by breaks in my reading. The ending was both shocking and filled with unexpected revelations, keeping me engaged throughout. I enjoyed the resolutions for each character, which left me hopeful for their futures, even as it became clear this would likely be the last time we see them—a satisfying conclusion for a standalone novel.\n\nEmer is a dangerous, nomadic girl who aids women in confronting their demons, both metaphorical and literal. Jude grapples with a curse that threatens to consume her soul, while Zara is desperate to resurrect her murdered sister before time runs out. The added tension of a serial killer targeting women with magic intensifies the stakes, and Emer is determined to seek vengeance for the victims. The narrative also explores Emer’s past through memories, providing insight into her motivations and character development. Overall, the story is a compelling blend of mystery, personal struggle, and supernatural elements.",
            "*The Invocations* is an enjoyable read, though I found myself wishing for a bit more spookiness. While the story avoids deep explorations of dark magic and religious themes—something I appreciated—it does include demons, so readers should be aware of that element. Centered on sisterhood and found family, the book offers a delightful mystery with a witchy vibe, making it a great choice for fans of these themes.",
            "I was eager to dive into the author's latest supernatural thriller, *The Invocations*, especially after being captivated by her previous work, *House of Hollow*. I anticipated a similarly eerie and mysterious atmosphere. While the book certainly delivered on supernatural elements, I found it somewhat lacking in genuine scares—though this may be due to my own growing tolerance for fear in literature. The subtle hints of romance, particularly the tension between Emer and Jude, suggested a potential connection, while Zara’s storyline wisely sidestepped a love triangle, keeping her focus on her sister’s resurrection and her own grief."

While it wasn’t as scary as I’d hoped, it delivered a captivating story with themes of sisterhood and resilience.",

However, other characters didn’t resonate with me as strongly.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the darker themes, I enjoyed the novel a lot and found it engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story leaned more into horror than I initially expected, its unique concept and strong portrayal of damaged rich kids made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The novel creates a haunting and tense atmosphere, particularly through its vivid descriptions of fear and vulnerability. The line, \"He's a slip of shadow, nothing more. No face, no weapon, nothing to indicate that he might do her harm. Just a man. But she is a girl. And she is alone. And it is night. And that is enough,\" effectively conveys a sense of dread and unease.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story explores themes of power, oppression, and survival, particularly through the imagery of \"rectangles of magic and power harvested from women.\" The description of these rectangles as \"stitches red and raw\" or \"faded to white\" symbolizes the pain and loss endured by women, as well as the exploitation of their power.  \n\n- **Characterization and Emotion:**  \n  The protagonist's resilience is highlighted through the line, \"Pain, though, means she is alive. Pain means she lived.\" This reflects her strength and determination to survive despite the suffering she endures.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel masterfully weaves a dark and evocative narrative, blending themes of power, oppression, and survival with a deeply emotional portrayal of its protagonist. The vivid imagery and tense atmosphere make it a compelling and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the depiction of a magical injury for one character felt unrealistic.

Each witch has her own agenda, yet they all seek to uncover the truth behind the killings. The story is gripping, and although I found it somewhat slow to piece together, there were still surprising elements within the mystery.",

This made the four-star rating even more of a pleasant surprise.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  I really love how dark and disturbing this YA book is. I assumed the author might not go as explicit due to the target age range, but this book is dedicated to \"all the angry girls,\" and that sentiment is evident on every page. The story doesn’t shy away from any topic, featuring epic amounts of gore and body horror that aren’t toned down. These elements effectively underscore themes of misogyny and violence against women and young girls, which a softer approach wouldn’t have achieved as powerfully.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The three main characters embody the \"angry girl\" archetype perfectly, and they all have compelling reasons for their anger. Their backstories were well-developed, and their actions mostly made sense as a result. I appreciated how the plot brought them together organically, though I personally would have liked more development of their connections after they met. Still, I was more than satisfied with what was provided.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story kept me engaged, but I felt some aspects were underdeveloped, particularly the logic tied to the villain reveal. However, the positives far outweighed these minor issues, making the book a strong four-star read for me.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Works:**  \n  I enjoyed this book enough that I definitely plan to pick up the author’s other YA horror works after this.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a dark, disturbing, and unflinching YA horror novel that tackles heavy themes with boldness and gore. While some elements felt underdeveloped, the strong characterization, thematic depth, and engaging plot made it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n8.3/10 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Krystal Sutherland's writing is flawless, and the story is both emotionally impactful and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it to fans of gritty, horror-esque fantasy with strong female leads.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5 stars."

            "This book is skillfully crafted, featuring brilliant twists at the climax. However, I was able to partially predict the identity of the killer, which was a slight disappointment. The plot centers on the mysterious deaths of five women, prompting Emer, Jude, and Zara to join forces against a supernatural killer intent on eradicating magic and witchcraft. I enjoyed the concept and found the storyline engaging. The characters' narratives and backgrounds were well-developed, and I appreciated how their individual missions intertwined as they collaborated. The fast-paced writing kept me captivated, though I felt the romance subplot was unnecessary and added little to the overall story.",

The characters were sympathetic, the magic system was fascinating, and the ending left a lasting impression.

            "The pacing is exhilarating and kept me thoroughly engaged. The gripping mystery had me racing through the book in just two days. However, some plot twists, such as the identity of the serial killer and the Hunters, felt predictable.",
            "Jude's sense of humor is truly endearing, while Emer's badass attitude is a standout quality. Initially, Zara's obsession with her sister annoyed me, but she eventually won me over. However, Emer's age (17) felt unrealistic, as her thoughts and behaviors seemed more suited to someone at least 22. I also wished the author had delved deeper into the family dynamics, particularly regarding Jude's brother Eli and Zara's uncle.",
            "Although *The Invocations* didn't capture my heart as quickly as *House of Hollow*, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable. The author continues to be one of my favorites, and I look forward to exploring more of their work.",
            "The atmosphere is captivating, featuring witches, chilling depictions of Jude's curse, and a growing sense of dread as more women fall victim. Each girl's lifestyle—whether a runaway in Oxford or a decaying heiress in her manor—is vividly portrayed, creating an immersive experience. The sapphic yearning adds an intriguing depth to the narrative."

        "conclusion": "Despite some minor flaws, such as predictable plot twists and underdeveloped family dynamics, *The Invocations* is an engaging supernatural thriller with strong characters, impeccable vibes, and a frenetic pace. While it didn’t surpass *House of Hollow* for me, it solidified Krystal Sutherland as one of my favorite authors.",

The serial killer's motives felt underdeveloped; I would have preferred if his actions stemmed from a hatred of women's power or a belief that it corrupted them, rather than simply a desire for personal power. While the author hints at the killer's intolerance of women's strength, this theme isn't convincingly conveyed through his actions.",

It’s a gruesome and eerie story, perfect for a seasonal read.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The author’s writing is vivid and immersive, painting scenes so clearly that it made me feel uncomfortable, especially with the detailed descriptions of death, corpses, decay, blood, pus, and bodily fluids. My imagination held onto these images so strongly that I couldn’t fall asleep afterward.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book is very physical, with a focus on pain, injury, and the darker side of witchcraft.

The tone is dark, gory, and unsettling, with a vibe reminiscent of *Succession* (which is even mentioned in the book).  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are different and interesting, though I found it frustrating that all of them had four-letter names, which made it hard to keep track of who was who throughout the book.  \n\n- **Twist and Complexity:**  \n  I guessed the twist halfway through, but that wasn’t an issue since it’s a YA novel and not meant to be overly intricate.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a disgustingly gory and eerie women-centered novel. I can always count on Sutherland to deliver, and I’m excited to read her next work.

Their dynamic as a team is engaging and adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The novel is set in London, particularly in areas familiar to the reader, which makes it easier to visualize the scenes and immerse oneself in the story.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  While the book is part of a horror subscription, it leans more toward a murder mystery thriller with some horror elements, such as graphic and gory moments. It’s not overly horror-focused but still delivers a spooky, atmospheric read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Invocations* is a compelling read with a unique magic system, well-crafted characters, and an engaging murder mystery plot. Its London setting adds a layer of familiarity, and while it has some graphic moments, it’s more of a thriller with horror elements than a full-blown horror novel. Perfect for spooky season!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot is engaging and maintains my interest, even though the villain's predictability is a drawback. The pacing is well-executed, allowing for a gradual immersion into the setting and the characters' lives. The story effectively highlights themes of feminism and the abuse women face, while also offering a positive representation of trans women. However, the portrayal of men as universally evil lacks nuance and feels overly simplistic.",
            "The three main characters are well-developed, each with distinct voices, particularly Emer and Jude. Jude stands out for her humor and unapologetic flirtatiousness, which adds depth to her character. In contrast, the villain, Eli, lacks depth, with motivations that remain underexplored. Bael, a demon character, is a highlight, showcasing the complexity of demons as not entirely evil. The romance between Jude and Zara has more chemistry than the intended pairing of Jude and Emer. While the unconventional love interest arc for Jude and Emer is intriguing, it feels unconvincing, though the romance itself is appreciated for its lack of rush. However, the progression of Jude and Emer's relationship feels abrupt, culminating in a sudden marriage at the end.",
            "The prose is lush and stunning, ranking among the best I've encountered in YA literature. The vivid writing immerses the reader, engaging the senses with remarkable clarity. Descriptions are rich yet concise, eliciting strong visceral reactions without redundancy. The author skillfully navigates both beautiful and grisly scenes, enhancing the overall impact of the narrative.",
            "Set in the UK, the world-building requires minimal additional development, yet the integration of witchcraft feels both convincing and authentic. However, the magic system is criticized for its simplicity, as characters experience little struggle or growth, which undermines immersion. Additionally, the characters—especially Zara, Jude, and Emer—come across as overpowered, detracting from the story's overall believability."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel is a compelling read with stunning prose, engaging characters, and a well-paced plot. However, it falls short in areas such as the predictability of the villain, the lack of nuance in its feminist themes, and the underdeveloped romance. Despite these criticisms, the book leaves a strong impression, with a desire for more stories in the same vein.",

            "The author’s fascination with sisterhood shines through in this book, much like in *House of Hollow*. This recurring theme is skillfully executed, adding emotional depth to the story. While the characters are engaging, some elements feel inauthentic, such as Jude’s desire for champagne at seventeen, which seems unrealistic for her age. Nevertheless, the book's exploration of dark themes—like curses, necromancy, and marginalization—is commendable. The characters face genuine consequences, such as Jude’s horrific leg wound and Emer’s tragic backstory, which enhance the narrative's depth and stakes.",
            "This book cleverly illustrates that men are incapable of wielding magic, humorously stating that “not even the devil trusts them to hold up their end of a bargain.” This gendered revenge fantasy is thoughtfully balanced by the inclusion of trans women in the magical realm, adding both comedic and significant depth for a young adult audience. Additionally, references to Roman curse tablets and a subtle allusion to Red Riding Hood near the end enrich the narrative with cultural and literary layers.",
            "The author’s works have garnered acclaim for their eerie and queer elements, which have become more pronounced since *House of Hollow*. The representation has evolved from a diverse mix of sexualities in *House of Hollow* to a more inclusive stance in this novel, suggesting that \"all women are queer unless specified.\" This progression is commendable, even if the author’s personal sexuality is ultimately irrelevant to the reader. The novel's political themes are surprisingly nuanced for a YA witch story, critiquing hierarchical systems and arguing that merely diversifying power structures—such as appointing women as CEOs—does not address systemic issues. However, the lack of racial diversity among the main characters and the problematic portrayal of the sole significant woman of color, a South Asian detective, are notable shortcomings.",
            "Despite its dark themes, the book features moments of humor, like the recurring joke about men’s ineptitude with magic and the clever choice of Dior’s Hypnotic Poison as Savannah’s signature scent. These elements infuse the story with levity and personality."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a dark, queer, and thought-provoking YA novel that excels in its exploration of sisterhood, gender, and systemic critique. While it has some flaws—such as occasional inauthentic character moments and limited racial diversity—it remains a compelling and ambitious work. The author’s willingness to tackle heavy themes, paired with sharp, humorous writing, makes this a standout read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Opening Line and Allusion:**\n   - The opening line, “a girl walks home alone at night,” feels unoriginal and lacks acknowledgment of Ana Lily Amirpour’s influence, particularly her film *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*. While allusions don’t always need direct credit, this feels too close to a “horizontal allusion” and could have benefited from a nod to Amirpour, especially since her work might not be widely recognized by Sutherland’s YA audience.\n\n- **Queer Representation and Themes:**\n   - Sutherland’s books are praised for their creepy and queer elements, which have intensified since *House of Hollow*. The representation has evolved from a mix of sexualities in *House of Hollow* to a more inclusive “all women are queer unless specified” approach in this novel. This progression is appreciated, even though the author’s personal sexuality remains irrelevant to the reader.\n\n- **Character Depth and Authenticity:**\n   - The characters are compelling, but some aspects feel inauthentic, such as Jude’s longing for champagne at seventeen, which seems unrealistic for her age. Despite this, the book’s willingness to tackle dark, gritty themes—like curses, necromancy, and marginalization—is commendable. Characters face real consequences, such as Jude’s horrific leg wound and Emer’s tragic backstory, which add depth and stakes to the narrative.\n\n- **Sisterhood and Relationships:**\n   - Sutherland has a clear fascination with sisterhood, evident in both this book and *House of Hollow*. This recurring theme is well-executed and adds emotional weight to the story.\n\n- **Gender and Magic:**\n   - The book humorously and pointedly establishes that men cannot use magic because “not even the devil trusts them to hold up their end of a bargain.” This gendered revenge fantasy is balanced by a clarification that magic is inclusive of trans women, which is both comedic and meaningful, especially for the YA audience.\n\n- **Politics and Social Commentary:**\n   - The novel’s politics are slightly more nuanced than expected for a YA witch story. It critiques hierarchical systems and rejects the idea that simply diversifying power structures (e.g., women becoming CEOs) solves systemic issues. However, the lack of racial diversity among the main characters and the problematic portrayal of the only significant woman of color (a South Asian detective) are notable shortcomings.\n\n- **Humor and Tone:**\n   - Despite its bleak themes, the book has moments of humor, such as the running joke about men’s inability to use magic and the clever choice of Dior’s Hypnotic Poison as Savannah’s signature scent.

However, the romance fell flat for me; while there was some chemistry, it lacked the strength to feel meaningful or engaging, ultimately feeling secondary to the plot. Additionally, the book's portrayal of gender is problematic, leaning towards gender essentialism. Although there is a brief mention of trans women being women, it doesn't sufficiently counter the overall TERF-like tone, especially since all the characters are cisgender.",

However, the portrayal of men as universally bad and untrustworthy, lacking nuance, evokes a sense of gender essentialism that I found uncomfortable. Despite this, the overall concept is compelling, infused with strong witch and horror elements.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n   - The book includes themes of self-inflicted wounds (ritual), body horror, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, strangulation, and mass murder.  \n   - The constant portrayal of men as universally bad and untrustworthy, along with the lack of nuanced representation, gave me gender essentialism vibes that made me uncomfortable.  \n\n- **Concept and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The general concept of the book is good, with strong witch and horror vibes.  \n   - The lore is interesting, and the atmosphere is consistently engaging, filled with demons, magic, and danger.  \n\n- **Characters and Dynamics:**  \n   - I liked all three main girls and their dynamics together.  \n   - Their individual backstories are unique and add layers of intrigue and motivation to each character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot:**  \n   - The pacing felt off, as the mystery didn’t seem to be the main focus.  \n   - The plot moved slowly, and the lack of a tense, time-sensitive element made it less gripping.  \n   - The focus on the characters' inner turmoils took away from the overall tension.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance didn’t quite work for me. While the chemistry wasn’t entirely lacking, it wasn’t strong enough to feel meaningful or engaging.  \n   - It felt secondary and didn’t add much to the story.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n   - The book’s portrayal of gender felt problematic, leaning heavily into gender essentialism.  \n   - There is a single mention of trans women being women, but it’s not enough to counteract the overall TERF-y feel, especially since all characters are cis.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mixed experience for me. While I enjoyed the witchy horror vibes, intriguing lore, and well-developed characters, the pacing, romance, and problematic gender essentialism detracted from my overall enjoyment. The atmosphere and mystery kept me engaged, but the lack of inclusivity and slow plot progression left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

THE INVOCATIONS was a perfect blend of dark, tense, mysterious, and paranormal elements. The idea of witches and witch hunters, along with the use of invocations to grant women borrowed power from demons in exchange for a piece of their soul, was fascinating and well-executed. It reminded me of an episode of Netflix’s *THE CHILLING ADVENTURES OF SABRINA*, which I believe was intentional, as the author, Krystal Sutherland, referenced the show a couple of times in the story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I loved the three main characters in THE INVOCATIONS. Zara Jones is smart, determined, and grieving the loss of her sister. Jude Wolf is trying to find a way back into her billionaire father’s good graces and the life of luxury that represents. Emer Byrne is simply trying to survive without being hunted by those who want witches dead.

It gave me exactly what I was looking for in a horror novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTHE INVOCATIONS is a dark, mysterious, and paranormal novel that delivers on its promises.

            "The romantic relationship felt unnecessary and forced, lacking natural buildup. I enjoyed Jude’s flirtation with Reece, which added humor without diving into a full romance. The story might have been stronger if the characters had remained friends instead of pursuing romantic entanglements. While I predicted one of the main plot twists, it didn’t diminish my enjoyment, as the author provided enough foreshadowing for attentive readers. The story starts slowly, making it hard to engage initially, but the pacing picks up significantly around the halfway mark, becoming gripping and hard to put down.",
            "I struggled to connect with the characters in this story. While I didn't dislike any of them, none were particularly compelling or memorable. Jude started off as unbearable and unlikable, though she had a few funny moments. Her constant complaints about money and her self-inflicted pain were frustrating. Zara felt underdeveloped and often sidelined, making her seem more like a background character. Emer was the most interesting, but she still failed to leave a lasting impression. Chopra, on the other hand, stood out despite some implausible actions; her likability made her a valuable addition to the cast.",

While I didn’t dislike any of them, none stood out as particularly compelling or memorable.  \n   - Jude was initially unbearable and unlikable, though she had some funny moments. Her constant complaints about money and her self-inflicted pain were frustrating.  \n   - Zara felt underdeveloped and often sidelined, making her seem more like a background character.  \n   - Emer was the most interesting character, but even she didn’t leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The romantic relationship felt unnecessary and forced, with little buildup or natural progression.  \n   - I appreciated Jude’s flirtation with Reece, as it added humor without committing to a full-blown romance.  \n   - The story might have been stronger if the characters remained friends rather than pursuing romantic relationships.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n   - Chopra was a standout character, despite some implausible actions. Her likability made her a great addition to the cast.  \n\n- **Foreshadowing and Predictability:**  \n   - I predicted one of the main plot twists, but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment. Sutherland provided enough foreshadowing for attentive readers to piece it together.  \n\n- **References and Humor:**  \n   - The “Breaking Bad” references throughout the book were a fun touch.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I would recommend this book, especially to fans of “House of Hollow” or those who enjoy descriptive horror. While the slow start and lack of strong character connections were drawbacks, the story’s feminist themes, vivid descriptions, and gripping second half made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

            "Jude quickly emerged as my favorite character, thanks to her intriguing and harrowing curse. The other characters are also well-developed, each possessing depth and engaging personalities.",
            "The author masterfully explores body horror in the YA genre, as seen in *House of Hollow* and further showcased in this book. The prose is vivid, savage, and brutal, aligning seamlessly with the characters and the story's tone. The unflinching depiction of gruesome details makes Jude’s curse particularly compelling and realistic.",
            "The magic system is captivating, particularly as illustrated through Emur. However, the role of religion within this system remains ambiguous. While witch hunters reference the Exodus, they fail to provide a deeper religious context. Additionally, the idea of \"tarnished souls\" and the afterlife is insufficiently explored, raising questions about the stakes and consequences of the magic system.",
            "The book tackles serious issues such as misogyny and violence against women, but its execution falls short. The social commentary is overly explicit, with the author directly stating the message instead of allowing readers to draw their own conclusions. This lack of nuance makes the commentary feel heavy-handed and diminishes its impact. As a result, the book risks being perceived as \"kill all men\" propaganda rather than promoting meaningful dialogue.",
            "The book skillfully balances its darker themes with humorous moments, creating an engaging tone throughout. It features several memorable quotes, such as, “Not even the devil trusts men to hold their bargains,” that leave a lasting impact."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I enjoyed this book for its strong characters, engaging plot, and vivid prose. However, the heavy-handed approach to social commentary and the lack of subtlety in addressing themes like misogyny detracted from its potential. The magic system was intriguing but underdeveloped, particularly in its connection to religion and the afterlife. While the book has all the elements to be a 5-star read, its clumsy execution of important themes and world-building left me wanting more.",

            "The story centers on three girls—Zara, Jude, and Emer—who unite to unravel a mystery involving witchcraft, demons, and witch hunters. While the plot is intriguing and ultimately satisfying, it takes some time to fully understand the unfolding events. The first half of the book is heavily devoted to character introductions and backstories, resulting in a slower pace. However, the second half picks up significantly, featuring heightened action, greater stakes, and a sharper focus on the mystery.",
            "The three main characters are well-developed, each with distinct personalities. Zara is a goody-two-shoes blonde determined to bring her sister back, while Jude is a sarcastic, witty girl banished from her wealthy family for practicing magic. Emer, a redhead witch, assists women with invocations. Although the characters lean towards stereotypes, they remain enjoyable and relatable. Character growth is minimal, with Emer experiencing the most change as she learns to embrace friendship after a long period of isolation. I found it challenging to distinguish between Jude and Zara, often confusing them for the first 150 pages.",
            "The book is accessible, featuring short, concise chapters and minimal descriptions. The pacing picks up in the second half, where the action intensifies and the stakes rise.",
            "The book's detailed exploration of witchcraft, rituals, and history is both engaging and compelling, surpassing typical fae narratives. Its portrayal of magic and demons is gruesome and unsettling, providing a stark contrast to the whimsical tone found in other witch-themed works like *Winterwood*. The story places significant emphasis on the power dynamics between witches and men, often depicting women as flawless and men as either incompetent or malevolent. This imbalance feels excessive and ultimately detracts from the story's overall depth.",
            "This is the first book I've completed in a long time, and it has rekindled my passion for reading and writing reviews. After three months without picking up a book, I felt ashamed and heartbroken, as reading is integral to my identity. Finishing this book has restored my confidence and reminded me of my love for writing reviews."

It was a bold and brilliant choice.",

I was impressed by her determination and how she navigated her relationship with her sister. Emer was initially perplexing, especially with her body-hopping, but once I grasped her strategy, I admired her intelligence. The climactic battle scene was breathtaking, especially the vivid imagery of Demon!Savannah disintegrating like dust. The relationships among the three protagonists were well-developed, and the chaos they unleashed was exhilarating. The analogy of the female Frankenstein monster was spot-on.",
            "The author’s descriptions of smells and gory scenes were exceptional. Zara’s comparison of cutting Jude open to dissecting animals in her class created powerful imagery and evoked strong emotions. This immersive and engaging writing has inspired me to seek out more stories like this.",
            "The portrayal of witches, cursewriters, and invocations in the book was both clever and captivating. It was evident that the author had crafted a detailed rulebook for this unique magic system, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The concept of invocations and the connection to demons, such as Bael and Emer’s demon family, was fascinating. Personally, I would prefer to be a cursewriter, as my passion for languages, writing, and creativity aligns perfectly with that role."

It felt like the author, Krystal Sutherland, had a detailed rulebook for how this specific type of magic worked, which I loved.\n   - The concept of invocations and the idea of being attached to a demon (like Bael and Emer’s demon family) was intriguing, though I personally would choose to be a cursewriter due to my love for languages, writing, and creativity.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**\n   - I sort of guessed who the hunters were, but not entirely.

The idea that his father on his deathbed could affect someone they met only once was a stretch.\n   - The romance between Emer and Jude could have used more development.

The story follows three teens—Emer Byrne, a cursewriter who binds demons to protect women; Jude Wolf, a cursed heiress seeking to lift her affliction; and Zara Jones, a grieving sister experimenting with necromancy to revive her sibling. The fast-paced plot keeps readers engaged as they race against time to catch a magical serial killer.",

            "Although certain plot elements, such as the final reveal, were predictable, the story remained engaging and never lost its momentum. Revelations and events were well-timed, effectively building suspense and maintaining reader investment. The conclusion was surprisingly neat and straightforward, especially considering the complexity of the events and character arcs.",
            "The three main characters are quirky, unique, and well-developed, each with motivations and backstories that enrich the narrative. Their distinct voices provide levity to an otherwise dark plot, while their individual arcs are logically constructed and cohesively intertwined, making their desires and goals compelling to follow.",
            "The magic system in the story is both intriguing and seamlessly woven into the plot. The roles of witches and demons, along with the use of invocations to channel magic, present a unique and compelling concept. Additionally, the horror elements create an immersive atmosphere that enhances the overall narrative.",
            "The connection between the main characters often feels underdeveloped, relying too much on trauma bonding instead of a deeper, more nuanced friendship. While their personalities are enjoyable, some exchanges and banter come across as unearned. Emotional responses to key events, particularly moments of grief, mourning, and betrayal, lack depth. For instance:  \n- Emer's reaction to discovering her loved ones' remains and the resurrection/destruction of her cousin feels insufficient.  \n- Zara's response to resurrecting her sister, being hunted by her, and ultimately killing her lacks emotional weight.  \n- Jude's exploration of her brother's betrayal and her father's protective actions is underexplored. Additionally, Lawrence's decision to banish Jude without warning her about her brother's involvement in the hunt seems inconsistent with his awareness of her witchcraft."

The complex relationship between Emer and her demons is intriguingly dark, prompting moral questions about her involvement in this tethering process.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n   - *House of Hollow* was one of my favorite books of 2021, and I was extremely excited for *The Invocations*. While I loved *House of Hollow*, comparing the two feels unfair. *House of Hollow* was like a dark fairytale with hidden rot, whereas *The Invocations* is a bloody, dark journey through shadows.  \n\n- **Themes and Content Warnings:**  \n   - The book explores themes of female rage, fear, and powerlessness, emphasizing that the only way to confront these issues is with equal violence. Readers sensitive to blood and gore might want to skip this one, as Sutherland doesn’t shy away from graphic content, though it never feels gratuitous.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Characterization:**  \n   - Sutherland’s writing is technically lovely and lyrical. Her characters are interesting, complicated, and feel real. The sapphic love story, while a small part of the plot, is present throughout and adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n   - The world Sutherland has created is lush and fascinating, featuring witches, secret enclaves of witch hunters, and a demon world coexisting with ours. The magic system, which is divided along gender lines (women can wield it, but men cannot), is inclusive of trans women in a way that feels natural and well-integrated into the story.  \n\n- **Overall Tone and Impact:**  \n   - The book is gory, terrifying, and dark, yet ultimately empowering and triumphant without feeling schlocky. It solidifies Krystal Sutherland as one of my must-read authors.  \n\n- **ARC Quality (Technical Issues):**  \n   - The ARC I received had significant software issues, with words containing the letter \"F\" in the latter half being cut off and occasional omissions at the start of paragraphs. While this didn’t affect my enjoyment of the book, it was frustrating and made reading less smooth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a dark, bloody, and empowering novel that explores themes of female rage and powerlessness through a richly constructed world and compelling characters. While it differs from Sutherland’s previous work, *House of Hollow*, it stands on its own as a gripping and thought-provoking read. Despite technical issues with the ARC, the book itself is a triumph.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It boils out of the ground.\" The tone is dark and intense, exploring themes of anger and fear, particularly from a female perspective.",

At one point, I found myself bored and needed a break, indicating a lack of investment in their journeys. The book's heavy focus on how the world favors men and their abuse of power is particularly disheartening, especially for women. The absence of positive male characters reinforces a bleak worldview that becomes repetitive and exhausting.",

            "Emer’s journey is the most compelling as she reclaims her family’s land. In contrast, Zara’s storyline is marked by violence and grotesqueness, leaving her emotional resolution—whether she truly accepted her sister’s death—ambiguous. Jude’s character lacks depth, and her potential growth, particularly in terms of seeking independence from her father’s approval, remains unfulfilled. While the book explores the theme of women claiming power, it is often overshadowed by a pervasive sense of hopelessness, suggesting that no amount of power can shield women from male abuse. The concept is intriguing and unique, though at times it veers into gruesome territory. The fast-paced ending effectively sustains interest."

While the plot and its twists are predictable once you grasp the book's core logic, the journey remains enjoyable.

For instance, what if someone doesn't meet the criteria for femininity to access magic? Do they lose their magic upon transitioning? The rigid, binary nature of the magic system feels limiting and disappointing, especially when compared to other fantasy works that explore similar themes with greater inclusivity.",

However, its black-and-white world-building, predictable plot, and inconsistent magic system detract from its overall impact. While it’s an enjoyable and cathartic read, it falls short in addressing nuanced questions about gender and inclusivity within its magical framework.",

Initially, I was unsure about connecting with these characters, but they grew on me as their backgrounds and motivations were revealed. Zara, who seeks to resurrect her sister, was the hardest for me to relate to due to her obsession with raising the dead. Jude emerged as my favorite character.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing style is descriptive and immersive, with a lot of complexity in both the characters and the occult practices. While I don’t typically read horror, I found the book more gruesome than scary.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story felt slow and drawn out at times, particularly in the first half. However, the second half had a better pace and more action. I was able to predict the murderer’s identity about halfway through, which was a bit disappointing, though there were still some surprises along the way.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Gender Dynamics:**  \n  My biggest critique is the book’s strong anti-male tone. Men are consistently portrayed as aggressive, abusive, and something women must fear. While many female characters face terrible situations, I felt the portrayal of men as universally evil was too extreme. I appreciate strong female characters, but this felt unbalanced.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Invocations* is a well-written young adult fantasy with complex characters and an intriguing occult theme. While the pacing was uneven and the portrayal of gender dynamics felt overly extreme, the story was engaging, and the second half delivered more excitement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

Although I identified the villain early on, the unfolding narrative remained engaging and enjoyable.

            "While some aspects of the plot felt inconsistent, I found the story engaging overall. For instance, it struck me as odd that Lawrence, the powerful patriarch, wasn’t a witch hunter himself, yet his sons became fervently committed to the cause after a brief encounter with their grandfather. Given their violent past, including the killing of Jude’s mother, I expected Lawrence to be more authoritative with his sons. Instead, he chose to protect Jude by keeping her at a distance, though I believe he could have been more transparent about their family's history.\n\nThe ending sets the stage beautifully for a sequel. Emer’s choice to allow Bael to feed on her soul for strength to protect Jude was both bold and intriguing. Initially, it seemed like a suicidal move, but it appears they’ve struck a deal that allows her to live while he builds an army of witches against the hunters. I would definitely be interested in reading more about that!\n\nI also loved the final scene where Emer rebuilds her family home in Ireland, and Jude expresses her desire to stay forever. With the implication that Jude will inherit her family’s wealth, it raises the possibility that she may not even need to attend college.",
            "I appreciated how the story culminated, particularly with the revelation of Jude's family as witch hunters. The twist involving her favorite brother, Eli/Jah, caught me by surprise. The dynamic among the characters, especially Emer, Zara, and Jude, was truly engaging.",
            "I quickly read the book to prepare for a book club discussion, and I found it to be an enjoyable and easy read. I loved all three characters, but if I had to choose a favorite, it would likely be Emer, with Jude coming in a close second."

I didn’t see the twist about her favorite brother, Eli/Jah, coming. The dynamic between the characters, particularly Emer, Zara, and Jude, was compelling.\n\n- **Plot Coherence and Logic:**  \n  Some parts of the plot didn’t fully track for me. For instance, it seemed odd that Lawrence, the powerful patriarch, wasn’t a witch hunter himself, yet his sons became so intensely committed to the cause after briefly meeting their grandfather. Given that they killed Jude’s mom, I expected Lawrence to be stricter or more forceful with his sons. Instead, he tried to protect Jude by keeping her away, though I felt he could have been more open with her about the family’s history.\n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  The ending felt perfect for a sequel. Emer’s decision to let Bael feed on her soul to gain strength and protect Jude was intriguing. It seemed like a suicide move at first, but it appears she and Bael have reached an agreement where he’ll let her live to build an army of witches against the witch hunters.

While the plot isn't overly complex, it remains engaging enough to keep me hooked.",

It embraces a more intense gore element, which I found enjoyable, contrasting with *House of Hollow*'s emphasis on beauty within darkness. I also appreciate that the author avoided rehashing familiar patterns from their previous work, giving this story a refreshing originality."

Additionally, the cover art doesn't align with the characters' descriptions; both Jude and Emer are portrayed quite differently than intended, which was disappointing.",

The term \"witch\" is rarely used, and when it is, its meaning remains ambiguous. The titular invocations are deals with demons that leave marks on the skin, suggesting that the marked women are witches; however, they possess no inherent magic beyond the terms of their deals. Moreover, they do not even perform the invocations themselves, relying on a third party to do so."

The main twist in *House of Hollow* was masterfully executed, but the two twists in this book fell short. The primary twist felt gimmicky; if you possess outside knowledge, it’s immediately obvious, and if you don’t, it’s nearly impossible to deduce without guessing. The second twist was also quite predictable. Despite these shortcomings, I still enjoyed the ending, particularly the final battle and the subsequent events.",
            "The three perspectives were engaging in their own ways, but having all three protagonists be 17 felt overly convenient; a wider age range would have added depth. While their mature behavior can be attributed to their complicated lives, it still felt somewhat unrealistic. I found Jones to be an unlikable character, whereas Jude was well-developed, and Emer emerged as my favorite. Aside from Jude’s father, no other characters received significant development, which is understandable given that this book centers on female rage and intentionally sidelines male characters.",

It would have made more sense if they were at least a few years apart.\n   - The protagonists didn’t sound or act like typical 17-year-olds, which I attributed to their complicated lives and having to grow up quickly, though it still felt like a stretch.\n   - Jones was not a character I liked at all. Jude was well-written, but Emer was by far my favorite.\n   - No other character got decent development, apart from maybe Jude’s father. However, this is a book about female rage, so male characters aren’t meant to be afforded much focus.\n\n- **Plot and Twists:**\n   - At around the 60% mark, the protagonists started doing stupid stuff, which didn’t turn out too poorly but felt really dumb nonetheless. I guess this is where their age comes into play.\n   - The main twist in *House of Hollow* was exquisite, but the two main twists in this book weren’t as successful.

            "The story revolves around three characters—Jude, Emer, and Zara—whose lives are intricately linked through magic and murder. The unique magic system allows women to harness power by having a cursewriter inscribe an invocation on a pulse point, binding a demon that feeds on their soul, ultimately shortening their lifespan. Jude, the daughter of a billionaire, curses herself and becomes necrotic due to a poorly tethered demon. Her father conceals her condition by labeling her a drug addict, while she searches for a cursewriter to remedy her plight. Zara, determined to resurrect her sister through necromancy, encounters Jude at a crime scene. Emer, an orphan and cursewriter, writes invocations for women seeking power, but soon discovers that her clients are being murdered. As the girls unravel the mystery, the identity of the murderer becomes somewhat predictable, yet the layers and final reveal—Elijah, a descendant of witch hunters—are surprising.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  - I wanted a witchy mystery thriller for October, and while this wasn’t as thrilling as I hoped, it was still fun.  \n  - The last 100 pages were especially great, with unexpected layers to the mystery.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  - I loved the feminist themes. Only women can use magic in this world, and they use it as a means to gain power in a male-dominated society.  \n  - Men are not happy with this dynamic, which adds tension to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story follows three characters: Jude, Emer, and Zara, whose lives intertwine through magic and murder.  \n  - The magic system is unique: women can use magic by having a cursewriter write an invocation on a pulse point, tethering a demon that feasts on their soul. This grants power but shortens their lives.  \n  - Jude, the daughter of a billionaire, curses herself and becomes necrotic due to an improperly tethered demon. Her father hides her condition by claiming she’s a drug addict, and she seeks a cursewriter to fix her.  \n  - Zara is determined to bring her sister back to life through necromancy and meets Jude at a crime scene.  \n  - Emer, an orphan and cursewriter, writes invocations for women seeking power. Her clients are being murdered, and the girls discover the connection.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Jude’s struggle with her condition and her father’s secrecy made her arc compelling.  \n  - Zara’s determination to revive her sister added emotional depth.  \n  - Emer’s backstory as an orphan whose family was murdered by witch hunters gave her a strong motivation to help others.  \n\n- **Mystery and Twists:**  \n  - I thought the murderer was kind of obvious, but the layers and final reveal (Elijah, from a line of witch hunters) were unexpected.  \n  - Jude’s father’s actions, initially suspicious, were actually an attempt to protect her from witch hunters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivered a fun, witchy mystery with strong feminist themes and a unique magic system. While the thriller aspect wasn’t as intense as I’d hoped, the layered mystery and character dynamics kept me engaged, especially in the final 100 pages.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

While the fantasy elements were strong, the integration of real-life elements sometimes felt like a caricature.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the slow start and minor issues with modern references, I truly enjoyed the journey and highly recommend the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a haunting and engaging sapphic thriller that combines mystery, magic, and feminine rage. While it had a slow start and some cringy modern references, the well-developed characters, eerie tone, and gripping twists made it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book was enjoyable, but I found *House of Hollow* more compelling. The supposed twist was predictable; I identified the serial killer and the culprit behind Emer’s family tragedy by the halfway mark, if not earlier. However, I struggled to grasp the motivations behind these actions at that point. Zara’s choice to resurrect her sister ultimately backfires, culminating in a tragic necessity to kill her, which adds depth to the narrative. The resolution effectively weaves together themes of power, fear, and retribution, as Emer and Jude join forces against their shared adversaries.",
            "Jude grapples with self-inflicted curses and a troubled past, while Zara takes on the burden of raising her sister, a decision that ultimately leads to tragedy. Emer, chosen by demons—one of whom raised her—must create more witches and hunt witch hunters, adding depth to her character. The romantic relationship that develops between Jude and Emer introduces an emotional layer to the narrative. Complex family dynamics, including Jude’s brothers as witch hunters who killed Emer’s coven and their father’s failed attempts to protect her, fuel much of the conflict.",
            "The story weaves an intriguing magical world filled with witches, witch hunters, and demons. Emer returns to her family home to revitalize it, intertwining her personal journey with the broader narrative.",
            "The novel powerfully illustrates the constant fear women endure and serves as a poignant commentary on the challenges faced by strong women. It reveals how men, feeling threatened by their strength, will go to great lengths to undermine them."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was an engaging read with strong thematic elements and a compelling magical world. While the twist was predictable, the exploration of women’s struggles and the intricate character dynamics kept me invested. The tragic ending for Zara and the union of Jude and Emer provided a satisfying, albeit bittersweet, conclusion.",

However, I didn’t fully understand the motivations behind it at that stage.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  - The novel effectively highlights how women are forced to live in constant fear and serves as a commentary on the challenges faced by strong women. It explores how men, threatened by their power, will go to great lengths to undermine them.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Jude carries a lot of self-inflicted curses and struggles with her past.  \n  - Zara takes on the responsibility of raising her sister, which turns out to be a bad idea, ultimately leading to a tragic outcome.  \n  - Emer is chosen by demons (one of whom essentially raised her) to create more witches and hunt witch hunters, which adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  - The story revolves around witches, witch hunters, and demons, creating an intriguing magical world.  \n  - Emer moves back to her family home to revitalize it, tying her personal journey to the larger narrative.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n  - Jude and Emer develop a romantic relationship, adding an emotional layer to the story.  \n  - The complex family dynamics, such as Jude’s brothers being witch hunters who killed Emer’s coven and her father’s failed attempts to protect her, drive much of the conflict.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  - Zara’s decision to raise her sister backfires, leading to her having to kill her, which adds a tragic twist to the story.  \n  - The resolution ties together the themes of power, fear, and retribution, with Emer and Jude uniting against their common enemies.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging read with strong thematic elements and a compelling magical world.

One of the main characters, Jude, performs a botched invocation that leads to her leg rotting from thigh to knee, exposing bone.

This level of decay should realistically be fatal, making it challenging for me to suspend disbelief and fully immerse myself in the story.",

Furthermore, the story doesn't fully clarify his intelligence and power, leaving me with lingering uncertainties.",

However, I had questions about Bael’s motivations. Why does he want Emer to build an army? Is it simply to ensure a steady supply of women for him and other demons to feed on? His supposed desire for justice against witch hunters felt inconsistent with his nature as a demon.

            "The pacing of the book was excellent for most of the story, but the last third took a sudden, jarring turn. It felt as if a racing gun had fired, leaving me with a bit of whiplash as I struggled to keep up. The narrative was compelling, featuring three distinct characters: a billionaire's daughter, a curse-writing fugitive, and the sister of a murder victim. Together, they embark on a thrilling hunt for a serial killer targeting witches. Who doesn’t love that? It’s a moody, gruesome, and delightfully dark read.",

It’s a modern-day witch hunt with a unique twist on witchcraft and demonic connections.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The story revolves around two central mysteries: who is killing women who bear the invocations crafted by Emer, and who was behind the murder of the group of witches she grew up with as a child. These mysteries drive the narrative and keep the reader engaged.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel explores themes of persecution and control, particularly through groups of men who believe it’s their god-given duty to “save” these women by killing them and cleansing their souls. This adds a layer of social commentary on modern-day witch hunts and patriarchal oppression.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  There’s a budding sapphic romance woven into the story, which adds depth to the characters and their relationships.  \n\n- **Descriptive Style and Tone:**  \n  The book includes a lot of vivid, albeit gross, descriptions of rotting flesh and decomposing bodies.

The themes of demons, girl power, hidden societies, and teen horror were right up my alley. It felt like a nostalgic trip with a fresh twist.  \n\n- **World-Building and Demonology:**  \n  The demonology in this world was fascinating—gruesome, weird, and unique, yet still recognizable. It stood out from other interpretations I’ve encountered, which made the story feel fresh and intriguing.  \n\n- **Memorable Scenes:**  \n  There’s a particular scene involving an orchard that was both engrossing and gross (in a cool way). It left a strong impression and added to the book’s appeal.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Personal Connection:**  \n  If I had read this as a fifteen-year-old, it would have become my entire personality for at least a month. Even as an adult, I found it highly enjoyable, though I recognize it might not be for everyone.  \n\n- **Flaws and Criticisms:**  \n  The book isn’t without its flaws. The POV wasn’t always clear-cut, the ending felt slightly rushed, and the big twist was somewhat predictable. However, these issues didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its imperfections, I absolutely loved this book. It tapped into my love for supernatural stories and delivered a unique, engaging experience.

I personally related most to Zara, especially her pain over the recent loss of a family member. Jude, on the other hand, was a character I didn’t connect with, but I can see her appealing to others. Emar was someone I related to in small ways, though not in terms of major personality traits.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The novel features gruesome and gory writing, which may not be for everyone. However, if you can handle such elements, this book is worth picking up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKrystal Sutherland delivers another gripping and gruesome story with *The Invocations*. The well-developed characters, particularly Zara, make the novel relatable and engaging, though the gory writing style may not suit all readers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars."

My dislike for Jude was so strong that it significantly impacted my overall enjoyment of the novel.  \n- **Themes and Representation:** The novel feels heavily influenced by privileged white feminism, which detracted from my experience. While it includes a token acknowledgment of trans women, this does not mitigate the broader issues I had with its themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has strong elements like its magic system and horror aspects, my deep dislike for Jude and the problematic themes of privileged white feminism overshadowed these positives. This ultimately lowered my rating from a potential 5/5 to a 4/5.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

It’s unclear whether this was the author’s or publisher’s choice, but it impacted my enjoyment slightly.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite the mismatch in character age and target audience, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers a powerful exploration of female rage with a witchy twist, making it an enjoyable read.

However, the heavy reliance on this element, combined with my personal disinterest in the genre, left me feeling that the story didn’t quite reach its full potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

While *The Invocations* didn’t quite surpass her previous novel, *House of Hollow*, which set a high standard in storytelling and its effective use of thematic environments to evoke dread and a creeping sense of wrongness, it still stands as a strong work in its own right.  \n\n- **Horror Elements and World-Building:**  \n  The book excels in body and creature horror, delivering genuinely frightening moments. The magic system and world-building are fresh and inventive, offering a unique take on classical witches in literature.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  *The Invocations* provides subtle yet powerful commentary on familial love, feminism, classism, and the toll of a lifetime spent pursuing vengeance. I particularly loved the idea of women paying their own costs for power to navigate a world that offers them so little.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery kept me engaged, and I didn’t guess the killer until the conclusion began to ramp up (thanks to a single, pivotal word—you’ll know it when you see it!). However, I was slightly disappointed by the neat and coincidental way the story wrapped up. A tale with so much blood, tears, and emotional grit deserved a more nuanced ending.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, this was a fantastic read. If Sutherland’s work continues to impress as her last two novels have, I’m incredibly excited to see what spooky concept she comes up with next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a strong, inventive novel with excellent horror elements, fresh world-building, and meaningful thematic commentary.

            "The magic system relies heavily on binary gender, undermining the inclusivity the author intended. While the inclusion of trans women as witches appears supportive, it feels poorly researched and inconsistent. The absence of consideration for trans men, non-binary, and gender-fluid individuals reveals a misunderstanding of gender diversity. The gender-essentialist approach—suggesting that women are inherently trustworthy and capable of wielding magic while men are not—feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, the attempt to incorporate trans women through a reference to the soul comes across as tokenistic and poorly integrated into the established rules of the magic system.",

The plot is intriguing, offering a fresh perspective on witchcraft. The characters are well-defined, with clear motivations that add depth to the narrative."

The author’s attempt to show solidarity with trans women fell short due to a lack of research and understanding, making the story feel exclusionary despite its other strengths.",

Emer writes spells as tattoos in dead/old languages (e.g., Latin), which are activated by placing them on pulse points like the heart, neck, or wrist.  \n   - **Characters:** The main trio—Emer, Jude, and Zara—are well-written. Jude was my favorite, while Zara and Emer took some time to grow on me.  \n   - **Writing Style:** The prose is lovely, neither over-the-top nor overly complex. Some British/Australian terms were unfamiliar to me as an American reader, but this added authenticity.  \n   - **LGBTQ Representation:** Jude is confirmed to be a lesbian, which adds depth to her character.  \n\n- **What I Didn’t Like:**  \n   - **Graphic Murders:** Some scenes, particularly Emer’s flashback to her family’s murder and her cousin’s death, were unsettling and hard to read.  \n   - **Ending:** While the final scene with the trio at Emer’s family home and Jude kissing Emer was satisfying, the climax felt rushed.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n   - The book explores themes of the patriarchy, love (both familial and found family), and resilience.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - I recommend this book to fantasy lovers, fans of Krystal Sutherland, readers who enjoyed *House of Hollow*, and anyone who loves creative magic systems.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Invocations* is a gripping and imaginative novel with a unique magic system, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes.

Jude, the cursed daughter of a billionaire, stood out as my favorite character; her sarcastic, carefree demeanor conceals a rich inner complexity. Emer, an orphaned witch with a troubled past, adds another layer of intrigue. As the trio investigates a series of supernatural murders, their individual secrets intertwine with the plot. While the romance is light and could have been explored more deeply, this may stem from the challenge of balancing three POVs in a relatively short narrative.",

The narrative feels confined to the characters we follow, offering little context about the broader world.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator was exceptional, earning a perfect 10/10. The audiobook experience was just as enjoyable as reading the ARC.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The book is unapologetically for \"all the angry girls\" and boldly addresses the harsh realities of violence against women and female-presenting individuals. It mirrors the world we live in, portraying the ugliness and sadness of such violence through the experiences of two of the three main characters.  \n\n- **Magic System and Symbolism:**  \n  The magic system, tied to demons and one's soul, is compelling. It explores how much of oneself one is willing to sacrifice to change or escape a dire situation, often making the cost worth it.  \n\n- **Writing and Descriptions:**  \n  The writing and descriptions are top-tier. The vivid and detailed depictions of Jude's wounds, dead bodies, and corpses were so immersive that they evoked a visceral, squeamish reaction at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the book is a solid read, the villain's identity was somewhat predictable, which lessened the element of surprise. This is the primary reason for the 4-star rating instead of a higher one.  \n\n- **Author's Style and Appeal:**  \n  Krystal Sutherland's writing style and the \"immaculate vibes\" she brings have secured her a spot on my must-read authors list.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a powerful and immersive read that tackles difficult themes with unflinching honesty. Despite the predictability of the villain, the exceptional writing, vivid descriptions, and thought-provoking magic system make it a standout. Krystal Sutherland continues to impress, and this book is a testament to her skill as a storyteller.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5 stars.  \n\n*Thanks to Penguin Teen and Goodreads for the ARC!*"

It was more of an undertone throughout the entire book and then seamlessly became a beautifully executed subplot.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n  - Loved the grit. A demonic magic system that requires a lot of bloodletting with a blood bath finale I couldn't look away from.  \n  - Unsure how I feel about the glorification of demon magic and soul-demon tethers, but we'll look past that for now.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Content:**  \n  - I don't love that this book is marketed as young adult.

She definitely lives up to the hype with this one.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  All three main characters were fun to read about. They had strong and distinct personalities that were fully shown through both the dialogue and their narration.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magical Elements:**  \n  The magical elements of this world were incorporated well and managed appropriate darkness and grittiness without going into excessive edginess. I liked that the demons, while undoubtedly inscrutable and mystical, behaved like real animals, not just monsters.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The twists aren’t spectacular, though (spoilers, kind of?) Jude’s perspective and biases were compelling enough to actually build some doubt. I think everything with her family and especially her brother worked more in the same vein as Zara’s quest to resurrect her sister as a doomed dream and a source of tension for the reader, even if it’s not a shocking reveal.  \n\n- **Realism and Reader Engagement:**  \n  The characters' inability to see/accept the disaster coming still feels realistic, regardless of when the reader guesses what’s coming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKrystal Sutherland delivers a compelling novel with well-developed characters, a balanced blend of magic and darkness, and a plot that, while not reliant on shocking twists, maintains tension and realism.

Additionally, the plot relied on contrived coincidences—such as the sudden emergence of zombie Savannah and demons consuming bodies—that felt more convenient than organic.",
            "The story's use of three perspectives—Jude, Zara, and Emer—initially slows the narrative, as it requires time to introduce each character and their circumstances before linking them to the main plot. Jude's viewpoint could have been the most engaging as the sole narrator, given her ties to the witch hunters and the serial killer. Unfortunately, the characters often feel too similar or underdeveloped, making it difficult to form a strong connection with any of them. Zara, in particular, is underutilized and lacks a meaningful role in the story. The romance between Emer and Jude feels forced and lacks believable chemistry or common ground. Additionally, the epilogue fails to provide satisfying closure, with Zara sidelined and the group's reunion feeling superficial.",

The depiction of men as universally evil and irredeemable felt one-dimensional, undermining the narrative's complexity. Additionally, framing Emer's struggle with the demons as a feminist victory was problematic, as it reduced her to a mere pawn in the demons' game.",

This concept resonates with medieval beliefs about witches. The intriguing notion of witches' powers being stolen and the killer grafting invocations onto his body is well-executed. Additionally, the inclusion of necromancy and demons adds depth and a gruesome allure to the story."

The idea that only the girls could solve the mystery felt outdated, reminiscent of early 2000s young adult fiction where adults were portrayed as useless or absent.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The demons and occult elements weren’t scary or compelling, contributing to the overall forgettable nature of the story.  \n\n- **Relevance and Modern Appeal:**  \n   - The book’s reliance on outdated tropes, such as teens being the only capable problem-solvers, felt out of touch with the evolution of young adult fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTHE INVOCATIONS was a disappointing read that failed to meet expectations.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of magic, dark academia, horror, and female empowerment. The premise revolves around three women—Zara, Jude, and Emer—whose lives intertwine as they seek to overcome personal tragedies and supernatural curses. The story also incorporates a serial killer subplot, adding a layer of suspense and danger.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Zara is driven by the loss of her sister and her determination to bring her back, even if it means delving into dark magic. Jude, the cursed daughter of a billionaire, is desperate to reverse the necrotic decay of her soul after a failed deal with the devil. Emer, an orphaned witch, is selflessly committed to helping women in need, even at great personal cost. The characters are complex and their motivations are deeply rooted in their personal struggles.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is described as \"twisty and turny,\" with a slow-burn romance and a deadly twist. While the pacing is deliberate, it builds tension effectively, keeping readers engaged. The inclusion of a serial killer adds an element of unpredictability and horror.  \n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel creates a dark, gruesome, and atmospheric setting, blending elements of horror and dark academia. The tone is intense and immersive, making it a gripping read.  \n\n- **Comparison and Personal Impact:**  \n  While the book didn’t surpass *House of Hollows* in my personal ranking, it was still a wild and memorable ride. It served as an excellent conversation starter for our June Bookclub, especially during Pride Month, and sparked lively discussions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of magic, horror, and female empowerment, with complex characters and a suspenseful plot. Though it didn’t dethrone my favorite dark academia novel, it was an engaging and thought-provoking read that left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I had mixed feelings about the resolution. Jude's following in her mother's footsteps and acquiring a similar invocation felt excessive, especially since she was unaware of her mother's connection. Additionally, having her older brothers as witch hunters seemed overly convenient. Although Jude wasn't close to them and there was a significant age gap, her accidental entry into that life, given her unknown family history, stretched credibility.",
            "Emer had a fascinating background, particularly her ability to live off the grid by scavenging food from the college campus. I empathized with her tragic loss of family. Jude was a character I could relate to; her desire to lift the curse was understandable. While I recognized Zara's longing for her sister's return, I felt she needed to confront the harsh reality of death, especially after witnessing the consequences of raising the dead. However, her refusal to accept this was puzzling. I appreciated how the three girls collaborated to unravel the mystery.",

I appreciated how she managed to live off the grid, like taking free food from the college campus, and I certainly felt for her having survived her family being killed. Jude was a character I could somewhat understand, and it made sense that she’d want to get rid of the curse. While I could see why Zara wished her sister wasn’t dead, I felt like at some point she needed to accept the reality of the situation, especially after they saw what raising the dead looked like. However, that didn’t seem to deter her, which I didn’t fully understand.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Collaboration:**  \n  I liked the way the three girls worked together and tried to solve the mystery.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution and Convenience:**  \n  I had mixed feelings about the resolution. Jude following in her mother’s footsteps and ending up with an invocation just like her felt a bit too much, especially since Jude had no idea her mother had it. Additionally, I felt like having Jude’s elder brothers be the witch hunters was a bit too convenient. While I know she wasn’t close with them and there was a big age gap, her accidentally falling into that life given her family history—which she didn’t know about—felt a bit hard to believe.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book, particularly the characters and their dynamics, though I had some reservations about the resolution and certain plot conveniences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Their distinct motivations and relationships are well-crafted, and their teamwork in unraveling the mystery of the killings and the witch hunter adds significant depth to the narrative.",

In contrast, the character introduced in the prologue is far more intriguing.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Characters:**  \n  - The main character (FMC) is the least interesting and compelling. She comes across as a spoiled rich girl with a \"fuck boy\" attitude, but in a sapphic context. Her constant creepy flirtatious comments, regardless of how others feel, made her unlikable.  \n  - The character introduced in the prologue is far more compelling. She is strong, troubled, and deeply committed to doing right and protecting women. Her empowering character arc held my attention, and I would have loved to read a whole series about her.  \n  - The third FMC feels forgettable and serves mostly as a plot device to provide convenient information.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  - The plot had a lot of potential but ultimately fell flat. I believe this was due to the choice of POVs, which didn’t do justice to the story. A different perspective could have made the story more impactful and enjoyable.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  - The themes and plotlines felt mature, but the characters’ immaturity clashed with this, making it less cohesive. This might be a personal preference, but it detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n  - The dark magic system was a highlight. The concept of paying a price for power and the consequences of greed was a powerful and well-executed metaphor.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - While I wouldn’t recommend this book to everyone, fans of YA witchy stories might enjoy it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had moments of brilliance, particularly in its magic system and the prologue character’s arc. However, the main character’s lack of depth, the forgettable third FMC, and the flat execution of an otherwise promising plot left me feeling underwhelmed. It’s a decent read for YA witchy story enthusiasts but falls short of being a standout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I struggled with the relationships among the main female characters; while the story attempts to portray them as a cohesive trio, this dynamic lacks consistent development. The initial promise of a strong bond essential for solving the mystery ultimately falls flat. Additionally, the split POV among the three characters sometimes resulted in indistinguishable voices and temperaments, making their qualities feel diluted compared to the sisters in *House of Hollow*.",

The narrative repeatedly restated its thesis, showing a lack of trust in the reader's ability to grasp subtext, motifs, or callbacks. The limited feminist perspective sometimes felt exclusionary, particularly in its portrayal of diverse identities. For instance, the only Black character, a woman, is depicted as a suspect involved in violence against predominantly white women, which left a sour impression. Additionally, the failure to address the characters' biases made me feel alienated from the theme of women's unity.",

Character development often felt like a missed opportunity, as it wasn't effectively integrated into the mystery. In *House of Hollow*, despite a predictable ending, I was invested in the characters' growth and the impact of the reveal on them. Here, however, the lack of investment in the characters diminished my intrigue, especially since the mystery itself was less elaborate than I had anticipated."

The dynamic of the trio was undermined by the forced romance between Jude and Emer, leaving Zara as the odd one out.\n\n- **Audiobook Production:**\n   - The audiobook narration was a significant letdown. The narrator spoke too slowly, which felt patronizing and unnecessary. The performance was flat and unengaging, requiring adjustments to speed and pitch to make it tolerable. It didn't enhance the story and could deter new listeners from exploring audiobooks further.\n\n- **Physical Edition:**\n   - Despite my disappointment with the book, the physical edition from Illumicrate's Evernight box is stunning and beautiful. I don't regret purchasing it.\n\n- **Potential for Future Works:**\n   - I hope the author explores more adult themes in future books. This story had potential but could have been much better with a more mature audience in mind.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book wasn't bad, but it didn't meet my expectations.

While it’s not a bad book, it didn’t live up to its potential or my hopes.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The themes of \"female rage, sapphic relationships, and witches\" initially drew me in, but the execution fell flat.  \n   - The \"female rage\" aspect felt exaggerated and unrealistic, coming across as a one-sided attack on men rather than a nuanced critique of patriarchy.  \n   - The book lacked depth in exploring systemic issues, and the male characters were one-dimensional, serving only to be vilified.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The characters were underdeveloped, making it hard to empathize with them.  \n   - The romance subplot didn’t engage me, as I didn’t care much about the outcome of the relationship between the two main characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n   - The plot was decent but predictable, with stereotypical villains that felt overdone.  \n   - The only part of the story I genuinely enjoyed was Zara’s arc.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing was neither bad nor exceptional—it was just average.  \n   - The frequent references to \"TikTok, Instagram, COVID\" felt forced and will likely make the book feel outdated in a few years.  \n\n- **Content Warnings and Disturbing Elements:**  \n   - The detailed descriptions of decomposing bodies were disturbing and added nothing meaningful to the story, only unnecessary disgust.  \n\n- **Potential vs. Outcome:**  \n   - The book had great potential, but overall, it felt underwhelming and mediocre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book isn’t outright bad, it failed to meet my expectations.

            "While the writing quality was impressive, the overall plot fell short. The climax was thrilling, but the buildup felt prolonged. I anticipated a greater sense of creepiness; instead, the story leaned more towards a mystery-solving experience than evoking unsettling occurrences.",
            "The main characters should have been in their early 20s rather than 17, as this would have made the plot more believable, especially given the serious nature of their investigation. The romance between Jude and Emer felt underdeveloped; I found it lacking any emotional depth. Jude's character was particularly off-putting—while her snarky attitude towards her difficult family was relatable, her constant flirting with Reese, despite knowing it made him uncomfortable, and her refusal to call Zara by her preferred name made it hard to sympathize with her. Additionally, Reese's discomfort is understandable, considering Jude is still a minor.",

The sentence-to-sentence writing in this book is beautiful.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The overall plot didn't match up to the quality of the writing. The climax was exciting, but it took a long time to get there.\n   - I was hoping for more creepiness, but it felt more like solving a mystery rather than experiencing strange occurrences.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**\n   - I am NOT a fan of stories that claim all the real women (and some men) horrifically tortured and murdered during the witch craze were actually witches. This gives legitimacy to the hysteria and misogyny of the time, which the perpetrators don't deserve, even if they're long dead.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The main characters should have been early 20s instead of 17. It would have made more sense for the plot, especially since they were investigating something that would be more believable if they were older.\n   - The \"romance\" between Jude and Emer was just kind of... there? I felt nothing about it.\n   - I was not a fan of Jude. She was way too rude to everyone. While her snarky attitude towards her asshole family was fine, her constant flirting with Reese (knowing it made Reese uncomfortable) and refusing to call Zara by her first name (despite Zara specifically asking for it) made it hard to like her.\n   - On the age issue again, Reese's discomfort with Jude's flirting is understandable since Jude is literally a child.\n\n- **Overall Engagement:**\n   - Despite my issues, the book compelled me enough to finish it. The Evernight edition is gorgeous.\n   - I might pick up *House of Hollow* to read more of Krystal Sutherland's work because she is very good at the actual writing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Krystal Sutherland's writing is beautiful and the book was engaging enough to finish, the plot, pacing, and certain character choices left me wanting more.

The backstory and the science behind the invocations made sense to me. The few scary scenes were great and well done—they made me check under my bed or turn on the lights many times!  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were likable and interesting.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The storyline was good overall.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  I liked less the underlying war-against-women/all-men-are-bad theme. While I’m all for feminism and love strong stories that address inequality or sexism, this felt a little extreme and too pushy at times.  \n\n- **Descriptive Language and Gore:**  \n  Some parts of the book were a little too gruesome for me (at times, I was really happy not to be eating while reading). Additionally, the word \"pus\" was used too many times to my taste.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good read with enjoyable elements like the witches/occult theme, well-crafted scary scenes, and interesting characters.

            "The ending hints at intriguing possibilities for further exploring the humanity of witch-hunters and the consequences of demonic possession. However, the author's habit of eliminating characters one by one may hinder this potential. A more sympathetic and nuanced portrayal of the Old Gods and demonic power, akin to the works of Milton and C.J. Cherryh, would enhance the narrative.",
            "The protagonists are all stunning white girls, which undermines the book's claims to intersectionality. The characters' ages are inconsistent; two of the three main girls, intended to be pre-collegiate, seem more like post-collegiate adults, while the one who appears younger could easily be mistaken for a successful young professional. Although the relationships and dynamics among the characters are engaging, their motivations and behaviors occasionally come off as unrealistic or overly dramatic.",
            "The writing is exceptional and engaging, elevating the novel despite its problematic premises. The author skillfully evokes empathy for even the most abrasive, preachy, or borderline psychopathic characters. Overall, the enjoyable prose makes for a captivating reading experience, flaws and all.",
            "The book's world-building suffers from a lack of historical accuracy, leaning heavily on fashion and pop culture references instead of engaging in deeper intellectual or cultural exploration. The depiction of Irish winters and frostbite is factually flawed, undermining the setting's credibility. While the supernatural elements, like demonic possession and witch-hunting, are intriguing, they are not fully developed or effectively woven into the story's themes.",
            "The novel's premises are disappointing and often come across as superficial, particularly in its treatment of feminist and progressive themes. While it addresses issues like patriarchy, lesbian relationships, and societal perceptions of lost girls versus lost boys, these topics feel politically charged rather than thoughtfully explored. The intriguing idea that men are unafraid of the dark while women are, and the notion that witches sell their souls to demons to escape this fear, remain underdeveloped. Additionally, the portrayal of elite schools, business, and high society as breeding grounds for serial killer tendencies is criticized as a clichéd journalistic trope rather than a nuanced examination."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite its flawed premises, superficial themes, and inconsistent characterization, *The Invocations* is saved by its compelling writing and engaging storytelling. The book is a fun, if bizarre, feminist fantasy that explores themes of patriarchy, witchcraft, and societal power dynamics, albeit in a way that often feels shallow or politically charged. While the novel has significant room for improvement in terms of depth and accuracy, it remains an enjoyable read that keeps the audience invested in its characters and world.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Writing Quality:**\n   - The writing is first-rate and compelling, which saves the novel from its problematic premises.\n   - The author’s ability to make the reader care about even the most abrasive, preachy, or borderline psychopathological characters is commendable.\n   - The writing is fun and engaging, making the book an enjoyable ride despite its flaws.\n\n- **Premises and Themes:**\n   - The novel’s premises are described as \"wretched\" and often feel like mere poses, particularly in its portrayal of feminist and progressive themes.\n   - The book explores themes of patriarchy, lesbian relationships, and societal attitudes toward lost girls versus lost boys, but these themes are handled in a way that feels superficial or politically charged.\n   - The premise that men don’t fear the dark but women do, and the idea that witches sell their souls to demons to avoid this fear, are intriguing but underdeveloped.\n   - The book’s portrayal of elite schools, business, and high society as requiring serial killer tendencies is criticized as a common journalistic trope rather than a nuanced exploration.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The protagonists are all gorgeous white girls, which undermines the book’s claims to intersectionality.\n   - The characters’ ages feel inconsistent; two of the three main girls, who are supposed to be pre-collegiate, come across as post-collegiate, while the one who feels young could pass for a successful young professional.\n   - The characters’ relationships and dynamics are compelling, but their motivations and behaviors sometimes feel unrealistic or overly dramatic.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The book’s world-building is criticized for its lack of historical accuracy and reliance on fashion and pop culture references rather than deeper intellectual or cultural exploration.\n   - The portrayal of Irish winters and frostbite is factually inaccurate, which detracts from the setting’s believability.\n   - The supernatural elements, such as demonic possession and witch-hunting, are intriguing but not fully explored or integrated into the story’s themes.\n\n- **Feminist and Political Commentary:**\n   - The novel is described as a \"progressive feminist crie du coeur,\" but its portrayal of feminist ideals feels shallow and contradictory, particularly in its exclusion of diverse perspectives.\n   - The book’s ending, which seems to endorse a demon-led pogrom against those who harm witches, is criticized as heavy-handed and lacking in moral complexity.\n   - The author’s feminist worldview is applied in a way that feels more like a mirror image of white supremacist narratives, with a focus on demonizing men and patriarchal structures rather than exploring nuanced solutions.\n\n- **Ending and Future Potential:**\n   - The ending sets up potential for future exploration of the humanity of witch-hunters and the drawbacks of demonic possession, but the author’s tendency to kill off characters one by one may limit this potential.\n   - The book’s exploration of the Old Gods and demonic power could benefit from more sympathetic and nuanced treatment, as seen in works by authors like Milton and C.J. Cherryh.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite its flawed premises, superficial themes, and inconsistent characterization, *The Invocations* is saved by its compelling writing and engaging storytelling. The book is a fun, if bizarre, feminist fantasy that explores themes of patriarchy, witchcraft, and societal power dynamics, albeit in a way that often feels shallow or politically charged. While the novel has significant room for improvement in terms of depth and accuracy, it remains an enjoyable read that keeps the audience invested in its characters and world.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Writing Quality: 9/10\n- Premises and Themes: 5/10\n- Characterization: 6/10\n- World-Building and Setting: 6/10\n- Feminist and Political Commentary: 4/10\n- Ending and Future Potential: 7/10\n- Overall Enjoyment: 7/10"

The logic behind these choices is questionable, and the stakes are not sufficiently addressed.",

Jude's rock-n-roll aesthetic and carefree attitude stand out, while Zara's grief and motivation are compelling.

This lack of nuance made the story feel preachy and unbalanced.  \n  - Savannah, the female antagonist, was a notable exception and stood out as a well-crafted character.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  - The book felt overly preachy about women’s empowerment and the negative portrayal of men, which became repetitive and distracting by the halfway point.  \n  - The explanation for the villains’ actions (misogyny) felt simplistic and lacked the complexity seen in *House of Hollow*.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  - The multiple points of view took some time to adjust to and, at times, diminished the mystery of the story.  \n  - Despite this, each character’s storyline was beautifully written, and I enjoyed their individual arcs.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Descriptions:**  \n  - The graphic gore was well-described but became overwhelming for me, as I prefer a balance of horror and beauty, which was more present in *House of Hollow*.  \n  - Krystal Sutherland’s ability to create vivid, beating-heart protagonists and worlds remains a standout strength.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Invocations* has strong female protagonists and beautifully written individual storylines, it falls short of the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth of *House of Hollow*. The preachy messaging, lack of balanced characterization, and heavy reliance on graphic gore made it a less satisfying read for me. Despite these criticisms, Sutherland’s talent for crafting compelling characters and worlds ensures I will continue to read her work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The action scenes in this book were predictable and lacked excitement. The characters' motivations for their conflicts felt weak, and the reveals and plot twists were both unsatisfying and foreseeable. I anticipated the ultimate twist long before it was revealed.",
            "The characters in this story exhibit a chilling disregard for life, easily resorting to murder, whether of relatives or strangers. One protagonist resolves conflicts through financial means, even bribing a police officer for assistance. Another character nonchalantly suggests she may have harmed men to instill in them the fear women face when walking alone at night, yet this troubling notion is never explored further. Astonishingly, there are no repercussions for any of them, even after being discovered at a crime scene with blood and injuries, despite the mysterious disappearance of around 20 individuals.",
            "The language is refreshingly modern, filled with pop culture references and reflections on the pandemic that ground the story in contemporary society. The portrayal of women's insecurity when walking alone at night is particularly poignant. The writing is vivid, creating a perfect atmosphere throughout.",
            "I appreciated the magic system and its ties to witches and witch hunters in the story. The idea of witches inscribing their magic as an \"invocation\" on their bodies to harness spell power was intriguing and effectively executed.",
            "I had mixed feelings about this book. I was captivated at first, reading half of it in one sitting. However, when I returned the next day, the story lost some of its appeal. I'm unsure if this shift was due to the narrative direction in the second half or if I was simply more engaged reading late at night. The author's storytelling style seems better suited for slow, descriptive narratives, as seen in the calmer beginning that effectively established the setting and characters. In contrast, the action scenes felt less compelling, which may explain my diminished enjoyment in the latter half."

However, when I woke up the next day to continue, it didn’t feel as interesting anymore. I’m not sure if this was due to the story’s direction in the second half or if I was simply more engrossed because I read the first half late at night. I think Sutherland’s storytelling style is better suited for slow, descriptive narratives (the beginning was calmer, taking time to describe the surroundings, characters’ backgrounds, and build the setting) and less effective for action scenes, which might explain why I enjoyed the second half less.\n\n- **Action and Plot Twists:**  \n  The action scenes in this book felt predictable and boring. The characters’ reasons for fighting each other seemed weak, and the reveals and plot twists were unsatisfying and predictable. I saw the ultimate plot twist coming from a mile away.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  I did like the main characters, their relationships, and personalities. However, their lack of morality and how they handled dead victims bothered me. For example:  \n  - They had no problem killing people, whether close relatives or strangers.  \n  - One of the main characters solved all their problems with money, even bribing a police officer to help them throughout the book.  \n  - Another main character casually mentioned that she might have murdered/harmed men (to make them feel the fear women experience when walking alone at night), but this was never addressed again.  \n  - There were absolutely no consequences for any of them after being found at a crime scene covered in blood and wounds, despite around 20 people mysteriously disappearing.\n\n- **Writing Style and Atmosphere:**  \n  The language felt very modern, with many pop culture references and comments about the pandemic scattered throughout, making the story feel like it was truly set in today’s society. The depiction of the insecurity women feel when walking alone at night was extremely well done. The writing was vivid, and the atmosphere was perfect.\n\n- **Magic System and World-Building:**  \n  I enjoyed the magic system and its connection to witches/witch hunters in the story. The concept of witches having to inscribe their magic as an “invocation” on their bodies to access the spell’s power was very interesting and worked well in the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the modern writing style, vivid atmosphere, and the unique magic system, the predictable action scenes, unsatisfying plot twists, and the characters’ lack of morality and consequences for their actions detracted from my overall enjoyment.

The 'London Ripper' subplot is introduced early on but only reappears at the conclusion, leaving it feeling underdeveloped. Despite the complexity, I was able to deduce the identity of the 'London Ripper,' likely due to my familiarity with horror tropes.",
            "Emer, the protagonist, displays an unrealistic level of maturity and skill, acting as if she has centuries of experience despite being only 17-19 years old with just a decade of actual experience. By the end, her abilities, even with the aid of a demon, feel overpowered and inconsistent with her age. Additionally, all the main characters are around the same age, and I find myself growing weary of teenage protagonists who outshine adults. The book also leans towards an anti-men sentiment, portraying every male character as a vile villain. While the idea of men lacking powers is intriguing, it would have been refreshing to see a male character who wasn't antagonistic, perhaps even a friend to Emer.",

            "In the story, Zara and Emer uncover the truth behind Zara’s sister’s death before Zara herself does, which feels unsatisfying. It seems Zara could have been entirely removed from the narrative without significant impact. I found the plot twist involving Jude’s dad unconvincing; the notion that he wasn’t involved in the witch killings, despite his sons’ participation and his company’s suspicious growth, lacked credibility. Furthermore, the “bad parent trying to protect you” trope felt clichéd and poorly executed. The fact that he was about to marry a 23-year-old was also brushed aside, which I found troubling.",
            "From the very beginning, Zara stood out as my favorite character. Her quest to resurrect her sister, combined with her dark academia aesthetic, captivated me. I've always been drawn to necromancy-themed characters. However, I felt that Zara was often overshadowed by the narrative's focus on Jude and Emer. While I appreciated Jude's storyline, particularly the intertwining of her family history as witch killers and her romantic connection with Emer, Zara seemed like an afterthought. Although she successfully brings her sister back to life, she doesn't receive the same climactic resolution as the other two characters. Additionally, her struggles with an abusive uncle and financial hardships felt resolved off-screen, leaving her character underdeveloped."

The portrayal of men as uniformly oppressive felt reductive, but the book remains a thought-provoking and chilling read.",

While the story starts strong and delivers a powerful message, it loses some momentum and leans heavily into grotesque elements. The portrayal of men as uniformly oppressive felt reductive, but the book remains a thought-provoking and chilling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

I adored the rose gold sprayed edges on my Barnes & Noble edition.\n\n- **Accuracy of Medical Details:**  \n  As a healthcare provider, I found the depiction of CPR and defibrillation cringe-worthy. Performing CPR on someone with a pulse and using a defibrillator to restart a completely stopped heart is inaccurate. A defibrillator is meant to shock an irregularly beating heart back into a normal rhythm, not restart a flatlined heart. Zapping Jude with electricity when her heart had stopped would have done nothing but fry her.\n\n- **Suspension of Disbelief:**  \n  I understand that some suspension of disbelief is required for a story involving witches, witch hunters, demons, a supernatural serial killer, and raising the dead. I could have accepted the idea that Emer’s *magic* somehow restarted Jude’s heart, but the use of electricity (even via an invocation) to restart a stopped heart was hard to accept. The author’s choice to use the term “defibrillator” specifically made this inaccuracy more glaring, as defibrillation refers to stopping fibrillation, not restarting a stopped heart.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was engaging and visually appealing, the inaccuracies in the medical details, particularly around CPR and defibrillation, detracted from my enjoyment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I was SUPER STOKED when I heard this book was releasing because *House of Hollow* was A HIT in my opinion! As an avid horror lover, the premise of witches hunting down a supernatural killer seemed like it had endless possibilities. Unfortunately, the book fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was my main gripe. It felt off, and the third-person narrative didn’t work at all. A lot of it was telling rather than showing, which was a major downfall for me.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance felt half-baked and didn’t add much to the story. It lacked depth and felt like an afterthought.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing was sluggish, and I found myself bored for a lot of the book. The stakes didn’t feel high enough, and the plot was riddled with coincidences and convenient points that made it hard to stay invested.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Jude was my favorite character because of her sarcastic and cynical nature, especially in serious situations. She saved a lot of the book for me, as the other characters didn’t leave much of an impression.  \n\n- **Plot Predictability:**  \n  I called the killer from the start, which made the mystery aspect less engaging. The lack of surprises or twists was disappointing.  \n\n- **Potential and Execution:**  \n  The book had a lot of potential, but it ultimately felt like a miss. Reading the acknowledgements and discovering it was a COVID novel made a lot of sense, as it seemed rushed or underdeveloped in places.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my criticisms, I was entertained at some points, though the spell (pun unintended) would wear off quickly. I’m more disappointed than hateful toward the book. I would still read another horror novel from this author, but I might stay away from YA indefinitely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had a promising premise but failed to deliver due to weak writing, sluggish pacing, and predictable plot points. While Jude’s character and occasional moments of entertainment kept me going, the overall execution left me disappointed. I’m open to giving the author another chance but might avoid YA in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Emer was \"the witch,\" exactly what you’d picture as a 17-year-old cursewriter. Jude was \"the rebel,\" disowned by her father after binding herself to multiple demons.

The witchy atmosphere was a highlight, but the plot and characters fell short for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

It's just not as good as *House of Hollow*. I was hoping it would be as good, if not better, so it felt like a letdown.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I think we were following too many characters. While I liked each of them, they weren't fully rounded. Zara, in particular, wasn't fleshed out enough—I could take her or leave her by the end. Her motivations also had a rapid change of heart at the end, which didn't make much sense.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I believe the story would have been stronger if it focused on one character as the POV, with the others seen through their eyes. This would have made the narrative more cohesive and improved the climax.  \n\n- **Cover and Marketing:**  \n  It didn’t make sense for Jude to be the focal point of the cover when, in reality, she’s no more of a main character than the other girls.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  I did predict part of the twist, but this is a YA book, so that’s not entirely surprising.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book isn’t bad, but it’s not amazing either. Despite my disappointment, I still look forward to whatever Krystal Sutherland does next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 (rounded down)."

While it was a pleasant read, I felt it lacked depth.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Emer’s character arc, particularly her realization of her life purpose to kill predator men, felt rushed and less personal than I would have liked. I wished her journey had more emotional weight and nuance.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The switch between the three characters’ perspectives was sometimes hard to follow, which disrupted the flow of the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt too neat and tidy for my taste. It didn’t fully align with the darker, more complex themes I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Plot Logic:**  \n  I found it puzzling that Emer, after deciding to protect women from witch hunters, spent months farming in a remote house with no water or electricity instead of actively seeking out women to protect. While it created a romanticized image of a natural forest witch life, it didn’t feel entirely logical.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  I absolutely loved Savan’s character and the bloodlust she brought to the story. Her presence made the final battle scene incredibly vivid and beautiful. Additionally, the villain reveal was a genuine surprise and a highlight of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an enjoyable read but fell short of my expectations. While it had some strong elements, such as Savan’s character and the unexpected villain reveal, the lack of depth in Emer’s development, the overly neat ending, and the occasional narrative confusion left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Jude was my favorite character, even though she’s not typically likable. Her humor, despite her annoying traits, made her endearing. Emer’s demon, Bael, initially comes off as creepy, but I grew to appreciate him as well. He genuinely cares for Emer, not just for her soul, and his line, “You have never been alone,” struck a chord with me—it was a surprisingly touching moment for a demon. I was relieved when Jude discovered that her father was trying to protect her and wasn’t a hunter; although he could have shown it better, his care for her was evident. I was also thrilled to see Jude and Emer finally together in the end."

I know you’re probably not meant to like her, but I found her really funny. She was super annoying, yet her humor made me like her despite her flaws.  \n\n- **Character Development (Bael):**  \n  Emer’s Demon, Bael, was described as creepy-looking, but I ended up liking him too. I felt like he genuinely cared for Emer, not just for her soul. His line, “You have never been alone,” really got to me—it was such a touching moment, even though he’s a demon.  \n\n- **Relationships and Resolutions:**  \n  I’m glad Jude discovered that her father was trying to protect her and that he wasn’t a hunter. While he could’ve done a better job of showing it, it was clear he cared for her. I was also happy to see Jude and Emer finally together in the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had a great concept and enjoyable characters, particularly Jude and Bael.

It felt a little jarring to me at times, which might have stopped me from fully loving the book.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  I liked the characters well enough. They were engaging and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Commentary:**  \n  The notes of rage and societal/political commentary were well done. The book tackles dark themes effectively without feeling overbearing.  \n\n- **Tone and Content:**  \n  This is a dark book with some stomach-churning body gore, but it never felt gratuitous. The intensity of the content was balanced and purposeful.  \n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  I liked this book and found it worth a read. I will definitely look out for other works by this author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the narrative style was a bit jarring for me, the strong characters, well-executed themes, and balanced tone made this a worthwhile read. It’s a dark and intense novel, but one that I would recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars"

While I found the witch-related elements intriguing and engaging enough to keep reading, the overall experience fell short of my expectations.  \n\n- **Character Development (Jude):**  \n  Jude's character, particularly the wound he sustained, was a significant turn-off for me. I could visualize it quite vividly, and it made me uncomfortable, as I don’t handle such graphic details well.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Stories:**  \n  Despite my mixed feelings about this book, I would love to see a sequel or spin-off focusing on Emer raising her own covens and the challenges they face. This concept has great potential and could be a compelling follow-up.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the witch-themed aspects of the novel kept me engaged, certain elements, like Jude's wound, detracted from my overall enjoyment. However, the idea of a future story centered on Emer and her covens is something I would eagerly anticipate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

There is something special in Sutherland’s books, and I truly like her style.  \n   - House of Hollow left me with a thirst for more of this kind of storytelling.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Predictability:**  \n   - Until the middle, everything was good, but then the plot felt crafted with too many misleading directions that didn’t pay off.  \n   - The story became predictable, and I lost the sizzling sense of curiosity I had at the beginning.  \n   - Once I saw where things were heading, I knew the ending wouldn’t be satisfying, and it wasn’t.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n   - I didn’t really ship Emer and Jude. The romance felt unnecessary or forced, not coming across as organic, as Jude herself had stated.  \n   - Good for those who could vibe with it, though.  \n\n- **Themes and Perspective:**  \n   - I liked the topics explored and the third-person perspective.  \n   - However, the overall message felt forced.  \n\n- **Unique Elements and Strengths:**  \n   - Despite the flaws, there’s a uniqueness to the book that I appreciate.  \n   - I’m very curious about the next adventure, as I’m all down for the killer vibe and strong female characters.  \n\n- **Technical Issues (E-book Format):**  \n   - Unfortunately, my e-book copy had many typos, sometimes more than three on one page. This might need revision if it hasn’t been addressed already.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Invocations left me with mixed feelings.

The idea of demons not wanting to \"collect\" because they’ve developed a kind of affection was very cool. The resolution of the mystery was super well-done and unexpected. The epilogue was mind-blowing.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt like I didn’t get to know the protagonists well enough. I couldn’t differentiate between them, especially since their names (Jude and Jones) were so similar. This confusion made it hard to follow who was the witch and who had lost her sister, which really bothered me.  \n- **Character Redemption:**  \n  The father’s redemption arc felt too cliché and didn’t resonate with me.  \n- **Author’s Voice and Themes:**  \n  At times, it felt like the author was inserting her own opinions into the story, which took me out of the narrative. For example, there was a moment discussing magic being exclusive to women, including a question about trans women, but it felt out of place and unnatural, as if the author was speaking directly rather than the characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a good, intriguing, and interesting book, but it wasn’t perfect.

This wasn’t a negative for me personally, but it’s worth noting for readers seeking a true YA experience.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The plot is intriguing, and I enjoyed the mystery and the reveals throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Connection and Romance:**  \n  As someone who values strong character development, I unfortunately couldn’t connect with any of the characters. The romance also felt forced and unsubstantiated. I was particularly disappointed when Jude decided to drop out of college to live with Emer. While I wouldn’t have minded if she hadn’t applied to college or wanted to transfer closer, the decision to prioritize “love” over education at 17 felt unrealistic and made me wince.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  I appreciated the inclusion of trans girls in the magic rules, as they are gender-based. This added a thoughtful layer of representation.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for a Series:**  \n  The ending was my favorite part—it was action-packed and entertaining. I could see this turning into a series based on how it concluded, though I personally don’t feel compelled to read more due to my lack of connection with the characters.  \n\n- **Medical Accuracy:**  \n  I was pleasantly surprised by the medical accuracy in the book. It’s the first novel I’ve read that mentions the need for defibrillation and correctly notes that rigor mortis doesn’t last forever. The only minor inaccuracy was the mention of a pulse continuing briefly after stopping compressions (prior to defibrillation). If a pulse is present, even a weak one, CPR wouldn’t continue. However, the overall accuracy was far better than most horror and fantasy books I’ve read, so I’m not upset about it.  \n\n- **Book Design:**  \n  The Evernight edition of this book is absolutely stunning.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel has a lot of potential, with its spooky atmosphere, intriguing plot, and thoughtful inclusivity.

However, the rushed plot, underdeveloped characters, and reliance on stereotypes held it back from reaching its full potential. Still, the author shows promise, and I’m eager to explore more of their work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Anticipation and Expectations:**  \n  I waited a long time for *The Invocations*, sometimes impatiently, as the release date kept being pushed farther and farther out. Young adult is my bread and butter, and the blurb for this book definitely caught me, hook, line, and sinker. I absolutely adored *House of Hollow* and mostly enjoyed *A Semi Definitive List of Worst Nightmares*. Sadly, *The Invocations* did not meet my high expectations.  \n\n- **Characterization and Narrative Structure:**  \n  The beginning was rather confusing, especially with the alternating points of view, and it was difficult to tell the characters apart. It was impossible to figure out the point of the story or get a feel for where it was going.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It took quite a few chapters for the pace to reach an acceptable speed. I often found myself putting the book down, disinterested, and close to DNF (Did Not Finish). It took me weeks to finish it; I really slothfully trudged through it.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n  I like Sutherland's writing style, but the story just did not mesh well. It seems she may have tried TOO hard with this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high hopes for *The Invocations* due to my love for Sutherland's previous works, this novel fell short of my expectations. The confusing start, lack of clear direction, and slow pacing made it a struggle to stay engaged. Although I appreciate the author's writing style, the story itself felt forced and disjointed.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Unfortunately, this book was a miss for me. The summary was intriguing, but the actual content felt boring and didn’t live up to the premise.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The plot was slow, and some elements didn’t make sense. For example, Reese Chopra, the detective Zara and Jude work with, had unclear and unconvincing motivations for involving them in her work. Her age was also never explicitly mentioned, which added to the confusion.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Jude Wolf, one of the main characters, was infuriating.

I found her behavior uncomfortable, especially her interactions with the married Reese Chopra. Additionally, I couldn’t connect with or care about any of the characters, particularly Jude, who felt like a poorly executed trope.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**  \n  The book suffered from a \"telling rather than showing\" issue. I believe this could have been improved if the author had spent more time exploring the past and showing the POVs of the three main characters when they were younger. This would have added depth and context to their relationships and actions.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The witch and paranormal aspects of the book were its strongest points. I found the magic system, which was heavily based on old languages like Latin, to be very interesting and well thought out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of the book was undeniably intriguing, the execution fell short. The slow pacing, confusing character motivations, and lack of emotional connection to the characters made it difficult to enjoy. Despite the strong world-building and magic system, the overall experience was disappointing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nDNF (Did Not Finish) at 30% (page 122)."

            "The plot effectively intertwines the storylines of the three main characters, creating an engaging narrative with clear stakes. The author demonstrates strong direction and narrative control, ensuring that most plot elements are coherent. However, the story struggles to maintain tension due to the overwhelming power of the witches, making the antagonists—the witch hunters—feel less threatening. At times, the narrative contorts itself to restore balance, which can be frustrating. The ending hints at potential systemic change, positioning Emer as a revolutionary figure, but the lack of historical context for why such change hasn’t occurred earlier is a missed opportunity.",

With their distinct personalities, desires, and agency, they feel like real individuals rather than generic, reactive protagonists. However, it's worth noting that the main characters are young, cis, white women, and the narrative fails to meaningfully engage with issues of privilege and intersectionality.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Writing Quality:**\n   - Krystal Sutherland is an amazing writer, and her prose is excellent, especially in its vivid descriptions. The writing is lush, angry, and powerful, with a sense of physicality that enhances the story. The prose is stylistically matched to the content, making magic feel magical and death feel substantial.\n\n- **Plot Structure:**\n   - The plot works well on an object level, with the storylines of the three main characters weaving together cleanly. The story beats are engaging, the stakes are clear, and most plot-necessary elements make sense. Sutherland demonstrates a clear sense of direction and narrative control.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters are the best part of the book. Emer, Jude, and Zara are proactive, defined by their histories, and drive the plot forward. They have agency, desires, and distinct personalities, making them feel like real people rather than bland, reactive protagonists.\n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**\n   - The book is thematically consistent, addressing patriarchy, power, justice, and gender directly. It uses a blunt but effective approach to explore these ideas, which are integrated into the plot and characters in a powerful, synergetic way.\n\n- **Magic System:**\n   - The magic system is one of the highlights, with spellcasting and cursewriting being brilliantly constructed. However, there are unanswered questions about demons, souls, and the broader implications of the magic system, which could have added depth.\n\n- **Gender Representation:**\n   - The book is gender essentialist, portraying men as universally evil and limiting the narrative in terms of audience and quality. This approach creates narrative issues, such as a lack of tension and predictable plot twists. The story also glosses over the existence of queer and trans individuals, missing opportunities for intersectional exploration.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - While the world is vividly described, there are significant gaps in the logic of the setting. The power imbalance between witches and non-magical individuals raises questions about historical and societal dynamics that are left unexplored. The lack of explanation for certain elements, such as the nature of souls and demons, detracts from the immersion.\n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**\n   - The story struggles with maintaining tension due to the overwhelming power of the witches. The antagonists (witch hunters) often feel non-threatening, and the narrative sometimes bends itself out of shape to restore balance, which can be frustrating.\n\n- **Representation and Privilege:**\n   - The main characters are young, cis, white women, and the story does not meaningfully address issues of privilege or intersectionality. Jude’s wealth and access to resources, such as a private jet, are never critically examined.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n    - The ending sets up the potential for systemic change, with Emer positioned as a revolutionary figure. However, the lack of historical context for why such change hasn’t occurred earlier in the story’s world is a missed opportunity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *The Invocations* has many strengths, including excellent prose, engaging characters, and a compelling magic system, it is limited by its gender essentialist approach and lack of depth in world-building and representation. The story’s thematic bluntness and predictable plot twists detract from its overall impact. Despite these flaws, the book remains an enjoyable read, and I look forward to Sutherland’s future work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Writing Quality: 9/10  \n- Plot Structure: 8/10  \n- Character Development: 9/10  \n- Themes and Messaging: 7/10  \n- Magic System: 8/10  \n- Gender Representation: 5/10  \n- World-Building: 6/10  \n- Pacing and Tension: 6/10  \n- Representation and Privilege: 5/10  \n- Ending and Resolution: 7/10  \n\n**Overall Rating: 7/10**"

Overall, the narrative feels overly simplistic and lacks the depth and intrigue necessary to maintain interest.",
            "The book aims to promote a feminist agenda but ultimately falls short by presenting female characters as clichéd \"not like other girls.\" Jude, a central figure, is sleazy and objectifies women, undermining the intended feminist message. The male characters are depicted as inherently misogynistic and abusive, lacking nuance and depth. The feminist themes are heavy-handed and repetitive, failing to resonate meaningfully. The characters are unengaging, leaving readers with no emotional connection, and their voices lack distinctiveness, making it difficult to differentiate their perspectives. Jude, in particular, is irritating and poorly written, with dialogue that feels awkward and cringe-worthy.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Expectations:**  \n  I was highly intrigued by the premise of this book, which promised a murder mystery involving witches and demons. It seemed like the perfect blend of dark academia, witches, and a murder mystery—elements I thought I would love.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The three main female protagonists felt like similar versions of each other, lacking distinct personalities or depth. This made it difficult for me to connect with or differentiate between them.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The plot moved very slowly, which made it feel like a struggle to get through. I was very close to DNFing (Did Not Finish) because the pacing didn’t hold my interest.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the promising elements, the book fell flat for me. I had to trudge through it, and it didn’t live up to my expectations. However, I can see why others might enjoy it, as it has aspects that appeal to many readers.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  I still want to check out another book by this author, as I believe they have potential, but this particular book just wasn’t for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and elements I typically enjoy, the lack of distinct character development and slow pacing made it a disappointing read for me. I appreciate the potential of the author and would be open to trying another of their works, but this one didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The straightforward nature of the plot left little to no suspense.\n\n- **Character Development and POVs:**\n   - The three different POVs were too much for the story, and the balance between them was never struck. The characters never branched out from their stereotypes, making it difficult to connect with them as characters or as people.\n\n- **Feminist Messages and Prose:**\n   - The feminist messages and prose felt forced and were thrown in your face. There were missed opportunities to show the story instead of telling it.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance felt out of place and did not integrate well with the rest of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this was a mediocre book that missed its mark. While it had some interesting elements like the atmosphere and gore, the predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and forced messages made it a less enjoyable read compared to the author's other works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

The basic premise is clear: a serial killer mystery set in a dark, magical world.  \n\n- **Descriptions and Imagery:**  \n  The descriptions of the ceremonies and crimes are graphic, which adds to the intensity and darkness of the story.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The mystery of \"whodunit\" was compelling and kept me engaged for about 70% of the book. However, after that point, the relentless darkness became overwhelming, and I felt a need for some relief or light.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dark fantasy novel delivers a gripping serial killer mystery with supernatural elements, supported by vivid and graphic descriptions. While the mystery was engaging for most of the book, the unrelenting darkness eventually became too heavy for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
