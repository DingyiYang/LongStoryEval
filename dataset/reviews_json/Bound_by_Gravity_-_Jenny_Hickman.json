            "This fantasy romance unfolds in a captivating fae world, exploring themes of forbidden love and star-crossed lovers. The narrative weaves a tragic past with second chances through dual perspectives and timelines. Elements such as insta-love and fated mates add depth to the story, while high angst and miscommunication drive the tension. The book concludes with a cliffhanger, leaving readers eager for more. However, it is important to note the presence of trigger warnings, including substance abuse, attempted sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, grief, and the death of a loved one.",
            "Senan and Allette are well-crafted, relatable characters caught in a doomed romance. Their love, intense and authentic, shines through even amidst the fantastical elements of the story. Senan’s relationship with his brothers, especially Kyff, adds significant depth to his character. Allette's insecurities and assumptions about Senan's feelings create compelling tension and conflict. The romance features engaging flirty banter, high-stakes moments, and a moderate spice level of 2/5, with intimate scenes becoming more explicit as the narrative unfolds. Ultimately, the bond between Senan and Allette is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, marked by moments of vulnerability stemming from Allette's self-doubt.",
            "The writing tends to be wordy and repetitive, featuring unnecessary explanations and excessive emotional inner dialogue. The dual timeline structure feels jarring due to frequent shifts between past and present. A more chronological approach or dividing the story into multiple books might enhance its flow and clarity.",
            "The fae world features a stark divide between the Scathians—winged, magical elites—and the Tuath, who are wingless and non-magical. This class disparity creates a compelling backdrop for potential uprisings. The exploration of court politics and international relations adds depth to the narrative, hinting at intriguing future developments.",
            "This novel is a powerful exploration of angst and emotional turmoil, consistently tugging at the reader's heartstrings. The final 10% is especially captivating, featuring unexpected twists and a cliffhanger that leaves you breathless. Despite the harrowing journey, the promise of a happily ever after keeps readers deeply engaged."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Bound By Gravity is a compelling fantasy romance that excels in creating a unique fae world and delivering high emotional stakes. The well-developed characters and intense, albeit tragic, romance make it a memorable read. However, the writing can be repetitive, and the dual timeline structure may not appeal to all readers. Despite these flaws, the novel is a great start, especially for fans of angsty, star-crossed love stories.",

            "The story centers on Allette and Prince Senan, constrained by societal norms. Allette, while not a peasant, lacks significance in the court, while Senan is a prince engaged to a princess. Their relationship ignites with a chance market encounter, followed by Senan's mild obsession with Allette. Despite his engagement, they embark on a secret love affair. Allette’s revelry in the mortal realm during Samhain adds a relatable and enjoyable touch to the narrative. However, Senan’s decision to abandon his royal duties for Allette feels unrealistic given the possible ramifications. The story concludes with a tidy happily-ever-after, which lacks authentic conflict or consequences, making the resolution feel unsatisfying. Overall, the cheerful ending seems too neat, leaving little room for deeper exploration or drama.",

            "The overall plot was fantastic and engaging, but the story felt overly long; trimming about 100 pages would have strengthened it. The pacing was uneven, with some sections dragging while others rushed by. Allette and Senan's relentless string of misfortunes felt excessive at times. The climax, featuring betrayal, imprisonment, and Senan’s near-death experience, was intense yet somewhat convoluted. While the ending, with Allette jumping into the portal after Senan, was dramatic, it left many questions unanswered.",
            "In this story, Allette comes across as a wilting flower, lacking resilience despite her struggles. Similarly, Senan grapples with self-pity, having wasted years on alcohol and drugs. Both characters appear overly passive, missing opportunities to improve their situations. Allette's unpreparedness for life without wings and her expectation that Senan would rescue her feel unrealistic. Senan's inability to distance himself from Allette during critical moments is frustrating. However, their love is believable and well-developed, featuring genuine and endearing moments. Trust issues arise from Senan's impending marriage and Allette's belief that he has abandoned her. Eason, though sketchy and untrustworthy, becomes a crutch for Allette. Aeron, Senan's brother, is inconsistent, failing to warn him of potential dangers. Allette's palace friends are suspicious, culminating in betrayal from one of them. Meanwhile, Jeston, despite his own questionable motives, plays a crucial role in aiding both Senan and Allette.",

The political dynamics of the fae world, particularly concerning the malevolent King Boris, introduced tension. However, the story missed an opportunity to explore Allette’s life without wings in the fae realm."

Although I typically dislike flashbacks, the ones here are masterfully executed. The narrative gradually reveals a complex tale of betrayal, political intrigue, and morally ambiguous characters. The author introduces a compelling cast of side characters, shedding light on a dark kingdom rooted in outdated hierarchies, power struggles, and deception. I eagerly anticipate the unfolding drama as Senan and Allette's story progresses.",
            "Senan and Allette's character arcs are profoundly moving, evoking a deep emotional response. The author excels at crafting deeply flawed male protagonists that elicit a strong desire to offer them comfort. I didn't think she could surpass the men of Airren, but Senan embodies passion, longing, and self-destruction in a captivating way. Allette challenges Senan to become his best self; she refuses to accept anything less than his entirety.",

The book made a home in my brain, and I have fully surrendered to it. It lures you in with promises of a sweet romance, sends you on an emotional spiral, and leaves you on the floor in a puddle of \"wtf\" and \"why, Jenny?!\" by the end. (Don't worry, HEA guaranteed.)  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book moves between the past and the present, following Senan and Allette's story—how they found each other, how they lost each other, and their next steps. While I’m generally not a fan of flashbacks, the flashbacks and layered stories in this one are chef's kiss. Jenny slowly peels back pieces of a much larger story of betrayal, political maneuvers, and morally grey characters. She also hints at other moments in the plot, introducing a cast of side characters that expose a dark kingdom built on antiquated hierarchies, power, and lies. I can't wait to watch this all explode as Senan and Allette's story continues.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Senan and Allette’s character arcs are so good they will make you ache inside. Jenny Hickman has a wonderful way of creating absolutely broken male main characters (MMCs) that you just want to hug. I didn’t think she could top the men of Airren, but Senan is passion, longing, and self-destruction rolled into one fabulous character. Allette, as a character, makes Senan the best version of himself—she won’t settle for pieces of him and won’t allow him to give only pieces.  \n\n- **Romantic Tension and Themes:**  \n  The forbidden nature of their relationship adds a delicious layer of longing to the story and has you rooting for them to defy the odds. If you are into forbidden romance and enjoy feeling emotionally devastated, add this one to your TBR.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJenny Hickman’s novel is a masterfully crafted story of love, loss, and longing, with deeply layered characters and a plot that keeps you hooked.

Some parts of the story felt repetitive and could benefit from pruning for improved pacing. Additionally, one plot device didn't resonate with me, which slightly diminished my overall enjoyment.",

The dual POVs enrich their experiences, amplifying the impact of their struggles. Additionally, Senan's bond with his brothers, particularly Kyff, adds an extra layer of emotional depth to the tale.",

The twist involving Eason was particularly surprising and expertly executed, leaving me in a state of bewilderment that I crave when reading. The ending presents a significant cliffhanger, making me hesitant about continuing the series, especially since the characters will be powerless in the human world. Despite its 475 pages, the book was a remarkably quick read that never felt like a chore; I found myself eager to keep turning the pages.",

The development of Senan and Allette’s relationship feels rushed and superficial; they meet at a market, he stalks her, they spend time together, share a kiss, and then abruptly skip ahead a year to being intimate. This lack of gradual buildup caused me to lose interest. The betrayals by Eason and King Boris were predictable, and Allette’s wings being severed by the king's guards felt inevitable.

I needed to know what happened next and desperately wanted Allette and Senan to be free and happy together.  \n\n- **Predictability and Engagement:**  \n  There were moments in the story that were pretty predictable, but as the reader, I could see everything happening and just wanted to shake the characters and make them \"wake up\" and focus. Despite this, the story kept me engaged and eager to continue.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n  The way Jenny Hickman ended the story made my jaw drop. The pacing and cliffhanger left me desperate for the second half of this duet.  \n\n- **Gratitude and Anticipation:**  \n  It was truly an honor to read this eARC. Thank you, Jenny Hickman and The Nerd Fam, for sending me a copy. I cannot wait for the continuation of this story!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an emotional rollercoaster, blending romance and fantasy with a tragic, fated-love narrative. While some moments were predictable, the story's intensity and the characters' struggles kept me hooked. The ending left me stunned and eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I generally dislike separation as a plot device, and since it was central to the story, my experience was less than enjoyable. The narrative lacked a strong plot, and while I can overlook this for compelling character or relationship development, that wasn’t present here. The twist involving the Bell was fantastic and unexpected, but it also introduced more insta-love, which I found off-putting.",
            "Senan's character felt one-dimensional, defined solely by his obsession with Alette. Their relationship lacked depth, with no significant growth or meaningful discussions about their lives and feelings. Instead, they rushed to satisfy their romantic desires, neglecting to heal from their individual traumas together. This resulted in an unhealthy dynamic. While they verbally expressed love when together, their overall communication fell short. The insta-love trope didn't resonate with me, and the preceding chapters added little to the story. Although Senan and Alette’s relationship was healthier than hers with Easton, that’s not much of an achievement. I found more depth in Alette’s friends at the castle, particularly Briathe and Jeston, who stood out far more than Senan's uninspiring brothers.",

He felt one-dimensional and overly infatuated.  \n   - The characters didn’t grow together or have deep discussions about their lives or feelings.

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced story, especially the surprising ending and unexpected twists, which were refreshing. While the love story was engaging, it left some plotlines unresolved and raised a few questions.",
            "I appreciated the dynamic between the male main character and his youngest brother. However, Senan, the prince of the most powerful Fae, felt underwhelming in terms of combat and speed, leaving me to wonder what truly defines his power beyond his wing color and kissing abilities. The magic system was intriguing yet unclear; while some Fae can wield fire or wind, it’s uncertain if all elements are accessible. Healing abilities are limited, and their power is tied to their wings, which are replenished by sunbathing, but the duration and limits of this power remain ambiguous.",
            "The Fae's visits to the human realm are perplexing. They freeze, dance, and drink hot wine to keep warm, yet it's unclear why they venture there if they lose their magic. The significance of these trips remains unexplained."

However, some aspects of the plot, character abilities, and world-building felt underdeveloped or unclear.
