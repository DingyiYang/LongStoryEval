            "Lydia often came across as a pushover, especially in her interactions with her sister, Fe. Despite Fe‚Äôs truly hurtful comments‚Äîsuch as the broken uterus remark‚ÄîLydia forgave her almost immediately. This lack of assertiveness left Lydia feeling underdeveloped and frustrating as a character. Although she acknowledges her tendency to be a doormat, her growth in setting boundaries occurs too late in the story to be satisfying. \n\nFe and Halle's behavior surrounding Lydia's surgery was equally troubling. Instead of offering support through the procedure and recovery, they completely ghosted her for over a week after a conflict, neglecting to check in before or after the surgery.

While I understand that endometriosis doesn't always lead to infertility, it was frustrating to see the main character, Lydia, magically get pregnant without any issues. This is a recurring trope in the few books I've found featuring characters with endometriosis, and it feels unrealistic. Statistics show that only up to 10% of those who undergo surgery for endometriosis can conceive afterward, making the ending feel dismissive of real-life struggles.\n   - The fact that Lydia's partner, Halle, was willing to carry any children was treated as an afterthought rather than a meaningful solution, which added to my disappointment.\n\n- **Character Development (Lydia):**\n   - Lydia's character often came across as a pushover, particularly in her interactions with her sister, Fe. Fe said and did some truly heinous things, such as making a \"broken uterus\" comment, yet Lydia forgave her almost immediately. This lack of assertiveness made Lydia's character feel underdeveloped and frustrating.\n   - Lydia even acknowledges her tendency to be a \"doormat\" at one point, but her growth in setting boundaries happens too late in the story to feel satisfying.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Relationships:**\n   - Fe and Halle's behavior was problematic, especially around Lydia's surgery. They were supposed to support her through the procedure and recovery but completely ghosted her for over a week after a conflict. They didn't even check on her before or after the surgery, which felt incredibly irresponsible and hurtful.\n   - Lydia's friends and loved ones, including Fe and Halle, were often overbearing.

Halle was a lovely character with great chemistry with Lydia, and I rooted for their relationship from the start.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Dynamics:**  \n  Lydia‚Äôs sister, Fe, came across as overly possessive, and I wished Halle and Lydia had addressed her behavior sooner. This aspect of the story felt slightly frustrating.  \n\n- **Personal Resonance with Themes:**  \n  While I personally didn‚Äôt connect with Lydia‚Äôs urgency to conceive (due to my own concerns about passing on genetic health conditions), I recognize that this part of the story will likely resonate with many readers.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite minor issues, the book was thoroughly enjoyable, and the strengths of the story far outweighed any shortcomings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was my first Alyson Root book, but it certainly won‚Äôt be my last. The novel‚Äôs exploration of chronic health conditions, coupled with Lydia‚Äôs relatable journey and the heartwarming romance, made for a compelling read. While a few elements didn‚Äôt fully click for me, they didn‚Äôt detract from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars (rounded up to 5 for Goodreads)."

This book was different from her usual works, with a more somber tone, but it was no less enjoyable.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I loved how Lydia and Halle's relationship evolved throughout the story. Halle's unwavering support of Lydia was particularly touching.  \n\n- **Themes and Relatability:**  \n  Lydia's struggle to get her doctor to take her symptoms and struggles seriously was something I think most women, unfortunately, can relate to.  \n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  The secondary characters were great overall. Cathy was hilarious and the kind of friend we could all use more of. However, I did not like Fe; I thought she was really selfish.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  I can't recommend this book enough!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Alyson Root stands out for its emotional depth, relatable themes, and well-developed characters. Despite its somber tone, it remains an engaging and enjoyable read, with standout moments in both the main and secondary character dynamics.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Following this, the narrative shifted its focus heavily toward the romance, disrupting the flow and diminishing engagement. The romance was the weakest aspect of the story; the love interest seemed too conveniently placed, as if handed to the protagonist without any real effort or tension. There were no stakes, conflict, or slow burn, making the relationship feel flat and unearned.

It‚Äôs refreshing to see this topic included in a sapphic novel, as I haven‚Äôt encountered it in this genre before. The portrayal of how endometriosis has impacted the main character‚Äôs self-image and her journey to find a partner is both realistic and compelling.  \n\n- **Character Relationships and Support System:**  \n  The main character has a strong support system, including understanding family and friends, which adds depth to her story and highlights the importance of having a network of care.  \n\n- **Medical Representation:**  \n  One aspect I questioned was the portrayal of the family doctor, who neither referred the main character to a specialist nor acknowledged her pain. This felt unrealistic and could have been handled differently to better reflect responsible medical care.  \n\n- **Humor and Lighthearted Moments:**  \n  The author includes a funny discussion about sex toys, which adds a touch of humor and lightheartedness to the story, balancing the heavier themes.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Enjoyment:**  \n  The story is well-written and enjoyable, making it a compelling read despite the serious subject matter.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel thoughtfully explores the impact of endometriosis on a woman‚Äôs life and relationships, offering a unique perspective within the sapphic genre.
