            "Mary and Toby are a perfectly matched couple whose relationship avoids the typical awkward breakup phase, with misunderstandings being the only source of tension—such as Toby mistakenly believing Mary was romantically involved with her cousin before discovering their familial connection. Toby's heartwarming reaction to Prince Charles, Mary’s past love interest, showcases his character depth, as he feels anger rather than jealousy. In contrast, the storyline involving Jack, Mary’s cousin, and his fiancée felt less engaging, despite contributing to the feminist theme—particularly her aspiration to be a pirate. The subplot about Jack needing pirate money for his fiancée’s divorce was confusing and lacked the impact of the main narrative.",
            "The book seamlessly integrates its feminist themes, presenting them in a subtle manner that feels organic rather than forced. Mary Read's journey as a pirate queen in a male-dominated world is truly inspiring, serving as a catalyst for other women to pursue their own paths. The portrayal of female pirates disguised as men further strengthens the novel's feminist message.",
            "This book seamlessly blends romance and fantasy, two of my favorite genres. I particularly enjoyed the writing style of the romance; it stood out for its refreshing approach. Unlike many best-friend-to-lovers stories, it avoided awkward miscommunications and unnecessary breakup tropes, which I truly appreciated."

Unlike many best-friend-to-lovers stories, there was no awkward miscommunication or unnecessary breakup trope, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n   - The main couple, Mary and Toby, were perfectly suited for each other.  \n   - Their relationship avoided the typical \"weird breakup\" phase, with the only awkward moments arising from misunderstandings (e.g., Toby thinking Mary was romantically involved with her cousin before knowing they were related).  \n   - Toby’s reaction to Prince Charles (Mary’s past love interest) was heartwarming, as he felt anger rather than jealousy, which added depth to his character.  \n\n- **Feminism and Themes:**  \n   - The book’s feminist themes were well-integrated and subtle, never feeling forced or overbearing.  \n   - Mary Read’s journey as a pirate queen in a male-dominated world was inspiring, and her success encouraged other women to follow her lead.  \n   - The inclusion of other female pirates disguised as men reinforced the feminist message.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots:**  \n   - Jack (Mary’s cousin) and his fiancée’s storyline was less engaging for me, though it added to the feminist theme (e.g., his fiancée’s desire to be a pirate).  \n   - The subplot involving Jack needing pirate money to pay for his fiancée’s divorce felt confusing and less impactful compared to the main story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Comparison:**  \n   - This book is one of my favorites by the My Lady Janies, second only to *My Lady Jane*.  \n   - The seamless blending of genres and the strong, well-developed characters made it a standout read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Salty Mary* is an excellent novel that masterfully combines romance, fantasy, and feminist themes. The well-crafted romance, inspiring protagonist, and subtle yet powerful messages make it a standout in the My Lady Janies’ collection. While some subplots were less engaging, the overall story was captivating and memorable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a high rating, likely 4.5/5 or 5/5."

I thought it was a clever twist on a historical tale and appreciated Jane getting a happy ending instead of a tragic one. This book, however, lacked the charm and fun of the original.\n\n- **Contemporary References and Humor:**  \n  The book tried way too hard to make contemporary references, like the \"shell phone,\" which felt forced and out of place. The author’s side notes were not funny, despite their desperate attempts to be.\n\n- **Use of Pop Culture:**  \n  The excessive use of 2010s pop song lyrics as dialogue was distracting, and the songs chosen were cliché rather than meaningful or clever.\n\n- **Handling of Historical Themes:**  \n  The book repeatedly emphasized the lack of diversity in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, which felt heavy-handed and unnecessary, as it’s already a well-known historical fact.\n\n- **Plot Depth:**  \n  The plot was superficial at best, lacking the depth and engagement I expected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the first book in the series for its clever twist and charm, this installment fell short. The forced contemporary references, overuse of pop culture, heavy-handed historical commentary, and lack of a compelling plot made it a disappointing read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was a fresh and intriguing take on a classic story.  \n\n- **Humor:**  \n  I enjoyed some of the humor in the book, though some parts felt a little too silly for my taste.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I enjoyed our main protagonist. She was engaging and well-developed, which kept me invested in her journey.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  I struggled around 35% into the book. The pacing felt off, and it didn’t hold my attention as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Plot Twists:**  \n  I enjoyed one twist in the book, but I wish there had been more surprises to keep the story even more exciting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a decent read with a creative premise and a likable protagonist. While the humor and one twist stood out, the pacing issues and lack of additional surprises held it back from being a fully captivating experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "The romance between Mary and Tobias feels like an unnecessary addition to the narrative, offering little to the main quest and potentially replaced by a strong friendship. It primarily serves to illustrate Mary’s growth beyond her past with Prince Charles. The plot is action-packed, chronicling Mary’s transformation from being spurned by Charles to becoming a pirate and vying for the title of Pirate Queen. This story is addictive, blending adventure, romance, and historical retelling seamlessly. The author skillfully references the classic Disney tale while maintaining a modern feel, incorporating clever nods like a crewmate named Swift.",
            "**Mary (The Little Mermaid):** A vibrant and empowered protagonist, Mary exemplifies that girls can achieve anything boys can, including piracy. With her cheerful spirit and determination, she makes for an engaging narrator. **Tobias (Love Interest):** Selfless and supportive, Tobias believes in Mary’s potential, even conceding his claim to the title of Pirate King for her sake. Their romance feels somewhat superfluous and could have been enriched by a strong friendship instead. **Jack (Mary’s Cousin):** Jack's chapters often come across as redundant, closely mirroring Mary’s character development. His exaggerated affection for his fiancée makes him less relatable. **Captain Vane (Villain):** A quintessential Disney villain, Captain Vane is mean-spirited and morally questionable without any deeper motive. He serves as a straightforward antagonist in the narrative.",

While it may not be life-changing, it's a lighthearted story that keeps you invested in the characters' journeys.",

She’s fun, cheerful, and never backs down from a challenge, making her a perfect narrator.\n   - **Tobias (Love Interest):** Selfless and trusting, Tobias believes in Mary and supports her ambitions, even willing to let her take his birthright as Pirate King. Their romance, while present, felt unnecessary and could have been replaced with a strong friendship.\n   - **Jack (Mary’s Cousin):** His chapters felt redundant, as his character and development mirrored Mary’s too closely. His over-the-top love for his fiancée made him less compelling.\n   - **Captain Vane (Villain):** A classic Disney-style villain—mean and crooked for no good reason. He’s universally hated and adds a straightforward antagonistic force to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Writing:**\n   - The plot is action-packed, following Mary’s journey from being rejected by Prince Charles to becoming a pirate and fighting for the title of Pirate Queen. The story is addictive, with a mix of adventure, romance, and historical retelling.\n   - The writing is smooth, seamlessly transitioning between three first-person points of view (Mary, Tobias, and Jack). This provides insight into the characters’ thoughts and relationships, though Jack’s perspective felt less impactful.\n   - Hand cleverly references the classic Disney tale while keeping the story modern and fresh, with subtle nods like a crewmate named Swift.\n\n- **Romance Subplot:**\n   - The romance between Mary and Tobias felt like an unnecessary addition to the story. It didn’t significantly contribute to the main quest and could have been replaced with a strong friendship. The romance seemed to exist mainly to show Mary’s growth beyond her past with Charles.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The novel emphasizes themes of female empowerment, as Mary fights to prove that women belong in piracy. It’s a story about falling in love with the sea and the life one creates for oneself, rather than being swept up in romance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a fresh and fun retelling of *The Little Mermaid*, blending adventure, romance, and historical elements into an entertaining pirate tale. While the romance subplot felt unnecessary, the story shines in its portrayal of a strong female protagonist and its lighthearted, action-packed narrative. It’s a delightful read for all ages, perfect for fans of Disney retellings and pirate adventures.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Overall Enjoyment: 4/5  \n- Characters: 3.5/5  \n- Plot and Writing: 4/5  \n- Romance Subplot: 2.5/5  \n- Themes and Messages: 4.5/5"

            "The story offers an entertaining adventure in the Caribbean, blending action, humor, and romance. However, the abundance of elements occasionally causes important details to get lost, detracting from the overall coherence of the plot.",
            "Mary's character occasionally lacks consistency; her motivations for piracy—such as robbing and killing—are not fully developed, which makes her seem overly kind for a pirate. In contrast, peripheral characters like Anne and Jack come across as more authentic swashbucklers, enriching the overall pirate world.",
            "The authors skillfully combine historical fiction with contemporary humor and anachronisms, a hallmark of their previous work, *My Lady Jane*. Although the tone and voice remain unique and engaging, the integration of historical and modern elements feels less seamless in this novel than in their earlier pieces.",
            "The blend of mermaid lore and pirate mythology creates a uniquely imaginative setting. The telepathic communication among mermaids and sea creatures enriches the world-building, adding an intriguing layer to the story.",
            "The authors reimagine the historical figure of Mary Read, an infamous female pirate, as a mermaid from Underwhere. The story follows Mary’s quest to become the Pirate Queen, driven by the desire to prove herself to her father and challenge the male-dominated pirate world.

            "While it took me a bit to warm up to the mermaid aspect, the authors ultimately wove it into the story quite effectively. My primary concern, common in historical fiction, is the anachronistic feminist attitudes of many characters, which seem to emerge well before modern feminism was conceptualized. However, given the book's lighthearted tone and self-aware nature, this issue bothered me less than it typically does. Still, it remains a persistent pet peeve of mine.",

            "This novel offers a quirky and adventurous retelling of *The Little Mermaid*, infused with pirates, humor, and unexpected elements like a musical number and an angry chicken. The story presents a fresh twist on the classic mermaid tale, featuring Mary Reed who leaves her underwater world for life among humans, only to suffer heartbreak when her love interest marries another. A delightful and surprising subplot revolves around a women's rights campaign, adding depth to the pirate-themed narrative.",
            "The book's three perspectives are skillfully and humorously crafted, creating a dynamic and engaging narrative. Protagonist Mary Reed is a relatable and strong character, particularly as her family affectionately calls her “Littlest,” despite her disdain for the nickname. The supporting cast is equally memorable, featuring Mary’s irritating sister Karen, a half-mer, half-human “cinnamon roll” character who aspires to marry his dream girl, and a Sea Witch who surprisingly defies the typical evil trope. Blackbeard adds a humorous twist with the revelation that he has over sixty children.",
            "This book offers a delightful, lighthearted experience that keeps me engaged throughout. Its humor and quirky elements, including an unexpected musical number and an angry chicken, enhance the enjoyment. The novel skillfully balances comedy with deeper themes, such as women's rights, resulting in a satisfying and entertaining read."

This fresh take on the classic tale was both creative and refreshing.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Mary, undergoes significant growth throughout the story. She discovers what she truly wants from life, which adds depth to her character and makes her journey compelling.  \n\n- **Pop Culture References:**  \n  The book includes clever nods to pop culture, such as references to \"famous\" captains, the *Titanic* movie, and Disney. These elements added a fun and modern layer to the story.  \n\n- **Series Experience:**  \n  This was the first book I’ve read from this series, and it left a positive impression. I’m intrigued to explore more of the author’s work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this retelling of *The Little Mermaid* to be a delightful and inventive read. The author’s writing style, unique plot twists, and engaging character development made it a memorable experience. The pop culture references added a playful touch, and I’m excited to read more from this series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story didn’t captivate me as a whole.  \n\n- **Familiarity with Subject Matter:**  \n  I didn’t know much about Mary Read beforehand, so I likely missed many references and inside jokes.  \n\n- **Genre Preferences:**  \n  Pirate stories aren’t really my thing, and my lukewarm feelings about westerns (and by extension, *My Calamity Jane*) might have influenced my experience.  \n\n- **Appreciation of Specific Elements:**  \n  I did enjoy the reworking of *The Little Mermaid*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated certain aspects of the novel, such as the creative reimagining of *The Little Mermaid*, the story as a whole didn’t fully engage me.

This made it difficult for me to continue, and I ultimately decided not to finish the book.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  The story felt like it was written for a preteen audience, with a tone and plot that seemed more suited to younger readers rather than an older audience. This made it less engaging for me personally.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  Certain aspects of the story, such as the romance, felt very predictable. This lack of surprise or depth in the plot made it less compelling.  \n\n- **Thematic Focus:**  \n  Despite the title and initial setup, there was almost no mermaid aspect to the story past the beginning. This was disappointing, as I expected more exploration of this theme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started off strong, it quickly lost its appeal due to its predictable plot, lack of thematic depth, and tone that seemed better suited for a younger audience. The absence of the mermaid theme beyond the beginning was particularly disappointing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (The reviewer did not provide a specific rating score but indicated they did not finish the book.)"

            "This book offers a creative retelling that draws inspiration from various stories, with *The Little Mermaid* being my favorite influence. It's not a direct retelling, so don't expect an evil sea witch or a dashing prince. The humorous references to other media, like the *Titanic* line, were mostly enjoyable, though a few felt forced and cringe-worthy. Fortunately, these moments were easy to overlook due to the engaging action. The main characters were well-developed and likable, with Mary’s transformation from the first chapter to the end being particularly impressive. Anne Bonny stood out as my favorite character—her bloodthirsty yet hilarious nature made her unforgettable. Each character had a distinct personality that shone through their dialogue and actions, regardless of the point of view.",
            "I was initially concerned about the writing quality given that the book has three authors, but I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent tone and quality throughout. This is particularly impressive, considering each author likely contributed a different point of view.",
            "Before reading this book, I had limited knowledge of real pirates, but it has significantly broadened my understanding. The authors thoughtfully address issues such as racism, sexism, and slavery, presenting them in a nuanced way that lightens the narrative without distorting historical facts.",
            "I’ve realized that I have a passion for pirate books, particularly those that strike a balance between humor and adventure. This one stood out for its lighthearted tone, clever pop culture references, and refreshing writing style."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Quality and Consistency:**  \n   - I was initially wary about the quality of writing due to the book having three authors, but the tone and quality remained consistent throughout. This was impressive, especially since each author likely wrote one POV.  \n\n- **Retelling and Inspiration:**  \n   - The book is a retelling that pulls from multiple stories, with *The Little Mermaid* being my favorite inspiration. It’s not a direct retelling, so don’t expect an evil sea witch or a handsome prince. The references to other mediums, like the *Titanic* line, were mostly funny, though some felt a bit forced and cringe-worthy. However, these were easy to overlook because the action was so engaging.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Direct Address:**  \n   - The “narrators” talking directly to the reader added personality and fun historical tidbits. At first, I thought this might be annoying, but it ended up enhancing the story and making it more enjoyable.  \n\n- **Educational Value and Historical Context:**  \n   - I didn’t know much about real pirates before reading this book, but now I feel like I’ve learned a lot. The authors included elements like racism, sexism, and slavery, but handled them in a considered manner, making them slightly lighter without erasing history.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n   - All the main characters were well-developed and likeable. Mary’s growth from the first chapter to the end was incredible, and Anne Bonny was my favorite character—bloodthirsty and hilarious, which made her unforgettable. Each character had a distinct personality that shone through their dialogue and actions, regardless of the POV.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - I discovered that I love pirate books, especially those that aren’t too brutal. This one was funny and lighthearted, with a lot of pop culture references and fresh writing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*My Salty Mary* is a fun, lighthearted pirate adventure with strong characters, clever pop culture references, and a fresh narrative style.
