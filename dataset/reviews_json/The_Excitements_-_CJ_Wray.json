Their bond and resilience are highlights of the story.\n   - Archie, their nephew, is a standout character. He is written as a bright, caring, and thoughtful man who goes out of his way to improve his aunts' quality of life. His sexual orientation is handled well—it’s acknowledged but doesn’t define his entire personality.\n\n- **Historical Elements:**\n   - The inclusion of OSE, WRENS, and FANY thrilled my inner historical fiction fan, though I wished for a more in-depth exploration of these elements.\n\n- **Genre Expectations:**\n   - The book is marketed as a “one last heist” story, but it doesn’t deliver on that premise.

            "The plot spans multiple genres, including historical fiction, mild romance, espionage, jewel heists, and a hostage situation. However, this breadth causes the main focus to become muddled, leaving little room to explore Penny and Josephine in their twilight years. The narrative shifts between the present and flashbacks to the sisters' childhood, their military service, and their journey to the present, but the non-chronological order of these flashbacks complicates the timeline. Additionally, there are plot holes, such as Penny referencing the crystal elephant saga as a warm-up for France, despite being unaware of the trip at that time. The numerous subplots and time jumps create a jumbled narrative, making it difficult to keep track of the many characters involved.",
            "Penny, Josephine, and their nephew Archie make a delightful central trio. Each character is endearing, and it's amusing that Archie, despite his desire to emulate his aunts, doesn't quite take after them. The emphasis on women's contributions during the war, particularly through the WRENs and FANY, is both fascinating and well-executed. I would have preferred to see more of this aspect rather than some of the additional storylines.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n   - I loved the idea of two sprightly nonagenarians getting themselves into mischief while on a trip to receive recognition for their war efforts.  \n   - The concept of Josephine and Penny Williamson, beloved war veterans in their nineties, traveling to Paris to receive the Legion d'Honneur, is intriguing and sets up a promising story.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Structure:**  \n   - The plot covers a wide range of genres, including historical fiction, mild romance, espionage, jewel heists, and a hostage situation.  \n   - There is so much going on that the main focus of the story becomes lost, and we don’t see as much of Penny and Josephine in their twilight years as I would have liked.  \n   - The story jumps between the present day and flashbacks to the sisters’ childhood, their years in the armed forces, and their journey to the present. Unfortunately, these flashbacks are not in chronological order, making it hard to keep track of events.  \n   - There are some plot holes, such as Penny claiming the crystal elephant saga was a warm-up for France, despite not knowing about the France trip at that time.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n   - Penny, Josephine, and their nephew Archie form a great central trio. They are all likable, and it’s amusing that Archie doesn’t take after his aunts, despite wanting to.  \n   - The focus on women in the war and their contributions, such as the WRENs and FANY, is fascinating and well-executed. I would have preferred more of this aspect over some of the additional storylines.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - There is light humor throughout the book that works well and adds to the charm.  \n   - Despite the ups and downs in the story, it ultimately has a feel-good sense to it.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Detail:**  \n   - C. J. Wray did a fabulous job with the WWII history side of things, particularly in highlighting the roles of women during the war.  \n\n- **Pacing and Complexity:**  \n   - The story becomes very jumbled due to the numerous subplots and the non-chronological flashbacks.  \n   - There are too many characters to keep track of, especially with the frequent jumps in time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe bones of this story have a lot of promise, particularly the focus on women’s contributions during WWII and the charming dynamic between Penny, Josephine, and Archie. However, the book tries to be too many things at once, resulting in a jumbled narrative that detracts from the main storyline. While the historical aspects are well-researched and engaging, the excessive subplots and lack of chronological structure make it difficult to fully enjoy.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Premise and Concept: 4/5  \n- Plot and Story Structure: 2.5/5  \n- Character Development and Dynamics: 4/5  \n- Writing Style and Tone: 3.5/5  \n- Historical Accuracy and Detail: 4.5/5  \n- Pacing and Complexity: 2/5  \n\n**Overall Rating:** 3.5/5"

The pacing felt uneven, with certain sections dragging on and making it hard to stay engaged. I anticipated a final daring heist, but when it finally happened, it was overshadowed by another event, creating a competition between two major moments that diluted the climax's intensity. By the end, I was left with more questions than answers, as some characters and events appeared without clear purpose or resolution, leaving me confused about their significance to the overall narrative.",

            "The plot suffers from a lack of cohesion, featuring numerous random threads that fail to connect thematically or narratively. The strongest aspect is the historical fiction surrounding the sisters' WWII experiences, but this focus is abandoned post-war, leaving the story directionless. The subsequent events feel disjointed, with poorly executed timeline jumps that lack a clear connection to the earlier historical context. The integration of heist and mystery elements is weak, particularly the gunman’s hijacking, which feels random and unrelated to the main narrative. \n\nAdditionally, the story is riddled with plot holes and unrealistic elements, such as the sisters' physical capabilities at their advanced age and the absence of logical connections between events. The resolution of conflicts, including the gunman’s defeat, comes across as contrived and unconvincing. The pacing is slow, with present-day events feeling aimless and devoid of tension or humor. The tone shifts from dull to bizarre, with plot twists that seem random and unintentionally comedic. Overall, the book struggles to balance its historical fiction roots with its attempt at a lighthearted adventure featuring senior citizens.",
            "The characters in the story were bland and underdeveloped, particularly Archie and the supporting cast, who lacked depth and relevance to the plot. The sisters' emotional responses often felt unearned, and their relationships lacked authenticity. Side characters were introduced and then abruptly discarded, making it difficult to remember their significance. The dialogue varied in quality, from passable to awkward, with male characters sounding unnatural and the use of French phrases feeling forced and caricatured.",
            "The marketing and synopsis of *The Excitements* were misleading, suggesting a tale brimming with scandal, crime, and a daring heist that the book ultimately did not deliver. The actual content felt underwhelming, with the scandals and crimes being minor and the heist concept introduced too late in the narrative. While the summary hinted at a thrilling spy or covert operative adventure, the story only grazed these elements, instead focusing on disjointed plot threads."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Excitements* is a poorly executed novel that fails to live up to its promising premise. Despite some strong historical fiction elements, the plot is disjointed, the characters are underdeveloped, and the pacing is slow. The book’s attempts at humor, mystery, and drama fall flat, resulting in a confusing and unsatisfying read. While the WWII sections show potential, the overall execution is marred by poor transitions, unrealistic events, and a lack of thematic cohesion. This book is not recommended, even for fans of cozy historical fiction.",
