However, I’m not entirely sure if this very short story warranted its own edition.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis short story by Susanna Clarke is a delightful and nostalgic read, especially for fans of *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell*. While the standalone edition might feel unnecessary to some, Clarke’s writing and the additional content make it a worthwhile experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Surprisingly, it matched the exact vibe I was looking for, even though I couldn’t pinpoint what I wanted reading-wise at the time.  \n\n- **Story Structure and Style:**  \n  Like all of Susanna Clarke’s works, the story is deceptively simple. It’s a vignette about a girl in the woods who communicates with the forest and receives a gift she deeply desires, even at the cost of her life.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story masterfully intertwines pagan and Christian imagery, highlighting how both traditions describe the natural world in different ways. For readers familiar with Celtic or Roman mythology, the mention of ‘The Hidden Sun’ (or ‘Son’) is enough to grasp the story’s symbolism. The reflection on sainthood, rather than holiness, was particularly intriguing.  \n\n- **Author’s Insight and Afterword:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the author’s afterword, which provided unexpected insights into *Piranesi* (a book I read in 2022) and piqued my curiosity about Borges’s short fiction.  \n\n- **Illustrations:**  \n  The illustrations are beautiful, even if they aren’t a style I personally love. They complemented the story wonderfully, especially the series of three illustrations at the entrance of the Fox and the Blackbird. These felt like watching a film in slow motion, evoking the imagery of a literal film ribbon.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book deserves 4 stars.

            "The story revolves around Merowdis, a young woman who finds solace in the company of animals and the forest rather than her wealthy family. Gifted with the ability to communicate with animals and trees, she is depicted as neurodivergent, as noted in the afterword. The narrative delves into her yearning for freedom and her desire for a child, symbolized by a midwinter child who embodies light and healing. The climax features a fantastical and allegorical event, culminating in a poignant and unexpected twist.",

            "This story beautifully examines the relationship between the natural world and human imagination, evoking a gentler version of Donne. It intertwines themes of friendship, the significance of midwinter, and the enlightening presence of a child amidst darkness. The wood’s contemplative critique of human folly, paired with the introspective stillness of winter, enriches the narrative's depth.",
            "The story opens with the whimsical tone of a children's tale, evolves into a fable, and ultimately immerses readers in a semi-grounded, mystical world reminiscent of *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*. While it features direct references to the nativity, it transcends a simple Christmas narrative, offering much more beneath the surface."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Wood at Midwinter* is a beautifully crafted story that blends whimsy, mysticism, and profound themes. It’s a perfect holiday gift for fans of the author’s work, offering both a standalone narrative and a deeper connection to their larger literary universe.",

It’s a footnote of a footnote, with the original footnote seemingly vanished, which is a delightful quirk for fans of Clarke’s work.\n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  The story begins with the tone of a children’s tale, transitions into a fable, and finally settles into the semi-grounded, mystical world familiar from *Strange and Norrell*. It’s a Christmas story with direct references to the nativity, but it’s also much more than that.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story explores the connection between the natural and the imagined, creating a paradoxical view reminiscent of a gentler Donne. Themes of friendship, the significance of midwinter, and the idea of a child bringing light into darkness are woven throughout. The wood’s perspective on the foolishness of men and the quiet introspection of winter adds depth.\n\n- **Literary Craftsmanship:**  \n  Clarke’s artistic finesse is evident in her vivid descriptions, such as the wind rattling copper leaves and sending snow in white eddies. The story’s mystical perspective, seen through the eyes of a Saint, adds a unique layer to the narrative.\n\n- **Afterword and Author’s Insight:**  \n  The afterword is a treasure, offering insights into Clarke’s sources, her thoughts on the natural world, and how these elements relate to her works. Her reflection on snow as a symbol of quietening the spirit and signaling a different consciousness enriches the reading experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Wood at Midwinter* is a beautifully crafted story that blends whimsy, mysticism, and profound themes. It’s a perfect holiday gift for fans of Clarke’s work, offering both a standalone narrative and a deeper connection to her larger literary universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This was my first encounter with the author, and I appreciated the note at the end revealing that the story is set in the universe of one of their other works. This connection has motivated me to explore more of their writing.",
            "The story presents a strong Christian theme intertwined with elements of paganism, which appears intentional. The protagonist, Merowdis, communicates with trees and animals, introducing an enchanting quality reminiscent of traditional folktales. Notably, her conversation about the “hidden Sun” (or “Son”) in the woods effectively bridges Christianity and paganism, underscoring the similarities between folk narratives and religious texts.",

The blurb led me to think it was a faerie story, and while it was, it also wasn’t, depending on one’s interpretation of a faerie tale.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The story had a strong Christian theme but also felt very “pagan” in some ways, which I believe was intentional. The main character, Merowdis, speaks to trees and animals, and there’s a kind of magic involved, making it feel like a traditional folktale. The passage where Merowdis discusses the “hidden Sun” (or “Son”) with the woods seemed to purposefully connect traditional Christianity with paganism, highlighting the similarities between folktales and religious texts.  \n\n- **Book Design and Illustrations:**  \n  My favorite part of the book was its design. The illustrations by Victoria Sawdon were stunning and captivating, and the typeset by Goldy Broad was equally gorgeous. The visual elements added a magical quality to the reading experience.  \n\n- **Character and World-Building:**  \n  The story left me wanting to learn more about the characters.

Despite being misunderstood by many, she stays true to herself, indifferent to the judgments of others. Some view her as a saint, reminiscent of St. Francis, while others deem her insane. Her longing for a child serves as a central theme, with the woods ultimately guiding her to the answers she seeks.",

I only truly appreciated the concept after reading the author’s note, which provided additional depth and context. I believe a story should be able to stand on its own without relying on external explanations to enhance its meaning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had a beautiful atmosphere and a promising concept, it lacked the depth and impact needed to fully engage me. The story felt incomplete and relied too heavily on the author’s note to convey its significance, which detracted from its overall strength.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

I particularly loved the quote that resonated with the fairylike artists whose songs echo the same theme.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story shifts in tone, as the author leaves off the first web and begins another, crafting a well-argued treatise on the importance of friendship and what friends owe to each other.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the abrupt and open ending detracted from my overall enjoyment, the novella’s enchanting atmosphere, compelling themes, and unique narrative structure make it very worth reading.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

It delves into the idea of following this love into the wild, where animals, trees, and untamed landscapes become central to one’s existence. The book resonated with me because it articulated a truth I’ve always felt: that the natural world—snow, trees, animals, oceans, space, skies, lakes, rivers, mountains, and even hurricanes—deserves as much, if not more, love and fascination as people do.  \n  - *Viewpoint:* The message felt deeply personal and validating, as it mirrored my lifelong connection to nature.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  While the book’s message was simple, it was undeniably beautiful. It felt like a piece of art—a stunning painting that captures the essence of its subject without needing complexity.  \n  - *Viewpoint:* The emotional impact was more aesthetic than transformative, as the themes were already familiar to me.  \n\n- **Character and Relatability:**  \n  The protagonist’s journey into the natural world and their love for it felt relatable, especially the idea that others might not understand or share the same passion for the things that matter deeply to you.  \n  - *Viewpoint:* I connected with the protagonist’s perspective, as it mirrored my own experiences of feeling misunderstood in my love for nature.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose was poetic and evocative, painting vivid images of the natural world.

It’s also a quick read, which could help with reading goals, so why not give it a try?  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t connect deeply with the characters or story due to its brevity, I appreciated Susanna Clark’s writing style and the beautiful illustrations. This short story might appeal to those who enjoy quick reads or are drawn to its premise, but it left me feeling neutral overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned."

The world-building, particularly the mention of an Uskglass city in the north, is intriguing and leaves me wanting more Raven King lore.  \n\n- **Illustrations and Presentation:**  \n  The illustrations are lovely, though I wish Bloomsbury had invested more in them, such as commissioning Victoria Sawdon to create some or all of them in color. The hardcover edition is eye-catching, showing a willingness to spend on presentation.  \n\n- **Author’s Intent and Afterword:**  \n  Clarke describes the story as a phantom lost footnote from *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*, which is a charming concept. However, the afterword is twice as long as the story itself, and while it adds context, it also highlights how much more could have been explored in the actual narrative.  \n\n- **Publishing Industry Practices:**  \n  I’m frustrated with the trend of commissioning short, open-ended works from major authors like Clarke, Margaret Atwood, and Isabel Allende. These pieces often feel like quick cash grabs rather than substantial contributions to the authors’ bodies of work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Wood at Midwinter* showcases Clarke’s talent for creating immersive settings and characters, it falls short as a standalone story due to its brevity and lack of resolution.

While I’m not familiar with their work, Clarke’s explanation shed light on her thought process, though only to a limited extent.\n\n- **Themes and Concepts:**  \n  The idea of trees communicating, which has appeared in other books I’ve read, including Louise Penny’s works, was a standout theme for me. It’s an intriguing and charming concept, though it carries a darker, somewhat alarming undertone. While I’m not fully convinced by the idea, it was effectively used in this book.\n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The protagonist, Merowdis, a 19-year-old described as \"neuro-divergent\" and referred to as a \"saint,\" aims to heal the estrangement between humanity and the natural world. Clarke’s definition of saints as individuals interested in things others overlook is thought-provoking, though I feel it could use more refinement.\n\n- **Author’s Reputation and Motivation for Reading:**  \n  I picked up this book because Susanna Clarke is a New York Times bestselling author, though I hadn’t heard of her before. Additionally, I was behind on my Goodreads challenge and looking for a quick read. While I didn’t fully grasp or appreciate the story, it offered something different and provided food for thought.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a mixed experience for me.

The snow symbolizes a quieting of the spirit, a concept that resonates deeply.",
            "In winter, silence envelops the world—not an empty silence, but one filled with presence. As Merowdis wisely notes, \"In winter the wood is listening.\" Some stories resonate deeply, sinking into your bones. These lines enhance the emotional depth of the narrative."

The musical score was breathtaking and significantly enhanced my reading experience. I listened on Spotify and googled the illustrations, which were beautiful and atmospheric.  \n\n- **Prose and Story Substance:**  \n  Clarke's prose is incredible, as always, though I felt *Piranesi* had more substance. Nevertheless, I loved the magical realism in this story, which made for a perfect cozy read.  \n\n- **Themes and Insights:**  \n  The story made some interesting points, such as the idea that there will always be others who aren't interested in the same things as you. This was exemplified through Merowdis and her calling to the woods and its creatures. Additionally, the woods were portrayed not just as a setting but as a character in itself, with trees having their own thoughts and operating on their own time schedule. The snow was described as signaling a quieting of the spirit, which I found deeply resonant.  \n\n- **Quotes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  Some quotes I particularly liked were:  \n  - \"In winter there is silence. But not an empty silence. ‘In winter the wood is listening,' said Merowdis.\"  \n  - \"Some stories sink down into your bones.\"  \n  These lines added to the emotional depth of the story.  \n\n- **Length and Afterthought:**  \n  I appreciated that this could be read within thirty minutes, but I blinked and it was over. The afterthought, being nearly as long as the novella itself, felt a bit excessive. However, I am thankful to Susanna Clarke for contributing to my total books read this year!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a beautifully atmospheric and thought-provoking read, though I wished it had been longer. The magical realism, stunning prose, and unique portrayal of the woods as a character made it a memorable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 ⭐"

            "In this story, the protagonist Merowdis is a compassionate young woman with a deep love for animals and trees, who yearns for a child despite her former aspiration to become a nun. Her sister affectionately refers to her as a saint, highlighting her profound connection to nature. One winter day, Merowdis experiences a vision in the woods, which she believes will come to fruition, guided by the whispers of the trees. The narrative beautifully explores themes of interconnectedness and timelessness, encapsulated in the lines: \"All woods join up with all other woods. All are one wood. And in that wood, all times join up with all other times. All is one moment.\"",

I rated it 3-3.5 out of 5, partly because it was so short.\n\n- **Illustrations and Presentation:**  \n  The illustrations are beautiful and serve as a lovely accompaniment to the text, enhancing the overall reading experience.\n\n- **Author’s Afterword and Re-read Value:**  \n  The afterword by the author was much appreciated, and it prompted me to re-read the story with renewed interest. I think both the story and the author’s note would make excellent material for discussion in a writing class or literary book group.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  This is definitely a must-read for fans of Susanna Clarke.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story felt brief and underdeveloped, its charm, haunting quality, and the beautiful illustrations make it a worthwhile read, especially for fans of the author.

I've read *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell* and *Piranesi* twice, and enjoyed *The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories*.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  This one... not so much. Far slenderer than I had hoped. I yearned for even a very small serving of Clarke's exuberant, funny, expansive sensibility and imagination, and it's not much in evidence here.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  When I got to the part where Merowdis starts to talk about how desperately she yearned for a child of her own, born in midwinter without a husband, I thought, oh, please, not a Christian allegory of some kind. Please, no. Well, it isn't, quite. But too close for comfort.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The epilogue is the best part, where she muses on how this story came to her. I kind of wish she had waited till it bloomed more fully before publishing this very slight, lots-of-white-space, *almost* kid-lit-fairy-tale.  \n\n- **Personal Sentiment and Support for the Author:**  \n  Still, I don't mind spending a few bucks to support and thank her for the great pleasures I've already had from her. And will donate this one to my local library.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this novel fell short of my expectations compared to Susanna Clarke's previous works, I appreciate her talent and will continue to support her as a writer. The epilogue stood out as the highlight, but the overall story felt underdeveloped and lacked the richness I associate with her writing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I’ve read that Clarke has been struggling with writing longer works, which set certain expectations for this piece.\n\n- **Pricing and Format:**  \n  I came across this book in a bookstore, bound as a hardback and priced at thirty dollars. For what turned out to be a short story, this felt like a cash grab. I opted to download it from the library instead, and the entire listen took about half an hour.\n\n- **Story Length and Structure:**  \n  While I liked the story, it felt more like a prologue to a much longer work. Its origins as a footnote in *Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell* make sense, but it left me wanting more. Just as I was getting invested in the characters, the story ended abruptly.\n\n- **Epilogue and Resolution:**  \n  The epilogue was particularly jarring. It suddenly summarized a bunch of other interesting events in a \"Wikipedia plot summary\" style, which felt unsatisfying and incomplete.\n\n- **World-Building and Writing Quality:**  \n  Clarke’s talent as a writer shines through in the winter world she created. It was vivid and immersive, but like the Turkish Delight in the Narnia books, it felt like I only got a small taste and was left craving more.\n\n- **Publishing Practices:**  \n  I strongly dislike the practice of binding short stories and selling them at hardback novel prices. I believe her publisher should be held accountable for this.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Clarke’s writing and the world she crafted, this story felt incomplete and overpriced.

I was actually laughing when I turned the final page: that is all???!! It felt as if 2/3 of the story were missing.\n\n- **Story Length and Structure:**  \n  This is a very, very short story about a saint in a wood. What there is of it is nice enough, though very simple, laid out like a picture book with a few words or a brief paragraph on each page. The afterword is longer than the story and is mostly about Kate Bush’s music.\n\n- **Connection to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  The story’s connection to the world of *Jonathan Strange* is forced at best (and non-existent at worst), which made it feel—though I hate to even say this because I love the author—like a beautifully frosted pastry given to you by a faery woman that turns out, when you taste it, to be nothing more than a few snowflakes in disguise.\n\n- **Packaging and Presentation:**  \n  The package is lovely, and it would make a pretty stocking stuffer for Christmas.\n\n- **Future Potential:**  \n  I just read in the NYT that this is a thread from Clarke’s novel-in-progress (it also aired on the BBC in some form previously), so there will be more. That makes me feel a bit better about this.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the story is beautifully presented and has a certain charm, it falls short of my expectations in terms of depth, length, and connection to the author’s other works.

While the illustrations are commendable, they aren’t enough to salvage the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Illustrations: 2 stars  \n- Story: 0 stars"

It seems like a case of overcharging, especially considering the lack of substance in the book.\n\n- **Content and Substance:**  \n  The book is extremely brief and lacks depth or meaningful content. It feels almost devoid of substance, making it difficult to justify its publication or recommend it as a worthwhile read.\n\n- **Target Audience and Genre:**  \n  As a children's short story, it has a visually appealing cover and numerous illustrations, which might appeal to younger readers. However, the lack of meaningful content makes it fall short even within this genre.\n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  I enjoy short stories and have highly rated several 20-30 page stories this year, as well as moderately enjoyed a 9-page short story. I’ve also loved children’s stories of similar lengths. However, this book fails to meet the standards set by those works.\n\n- **Author’s Influence:**  \n  The book is likely to receive attention solely due to the author’s pre-existing fame, rather than any inherent value or lasting impact of the story itself.\n\n- **Audiobook Quality:**  \n  The audiobook is narrated by the author but suffers from poor audio quality, which is fuzzy and lacks the clarity expected in modern productions. While there is a musical piece that accompanies the narration, the lack of investment in improving the audio quality of the narration itself is disappointing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book feels overpriced and underwhelming, with a lack of substance that makes it difficult to recommend.

It took only about 10 minutes to read, which felt insufficient for a satisfying narrative experience.  \n- **Value for Money:**  \n  I’m relieved I didn’t purchase the book, as it would have been a waste of money.

Half of the book seemed like an afterword trying to convince readers why the story is good. I’ve read children’s books with better plots and more magic.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were underwhelming and lacked depth. They didn’t leave a lasting impression, and I found myself comparing them unfavorably to characters in children’s books.\n\n- **Connection to Other Works:**  \n  I’m still excited to read Clarke’s other works and won’t let this one color my opinion of her as a writer. I’m really hoping that “Midwinter” will somehow tie into her other works, leading to an “aha” moment that might make me revisit this review—though I doubt it.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you pick this up because “Piranesi” is on hold at the library, put it down, drive to a bookstore, and buy “Piranesi” instead.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book didn’t meet my expectations in terms of plot, characters, or magic, I remain optimistic about Clarke’s other works.

The book feels like a picture book for adults, with its visual and textual elements complementing each other seamlessly. The afterword offers insight into the creative process, connecting the work to inspirations such as Jorge Luis Borges and Kate Bush. Set in the same universe as *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*, the story draws from Kate Bush’s album *50 Words for Snow*, weaving in themes of folklore, music, and literary influences that enrich the narrative. Merowdis, the compelling protagonist, finds solace and purpose in the forest, defying societal expectations of marriage and religious conformity. Her bond with the animals and her role as a saintly figure in the woods deepen her character. Central themes of patience, hope, dreams, and the mysticism of nature resonate throughout the story.",

Dissatisfied with her choices, she finds solace and a kind of peace in the mysterious woods, where she connects with nature and discovers unexpected love.\"\n\n- **Illustrations and Visual Appeal:**  \n  \"The illustrations by Victoria Sawdon are absolutely stunning—they don’t just complement the narrative, they enhance it, adding layers of depth and atmosphere that make the story feel even more magical and immersive.\"\n\n- **World-Building and Connection to Other Works:**  \n  \"This story, set in the same world as Jonathan Strange, offers a tantalizing glimpse of that richly imagined universe. As a devoted fan of Clarke, I loved learning about the inspiration behind Piranesi and Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell in the afterword, which alone is worth the price of the book.\"\n\n- **Length and Desire for More:**  \n  \"My only complaint is that I want more. The story, while beautiful, feels brief, leaving me longing for further exploration of this world and its characters.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Wood at Midwinter is a stunning and immersive tale that showcases Susanna Clarke’s exceptional storytelling and Victoria Sawdon’s breathtaking illustrations. While the story is brief, it beautifully captures the protagonist’s emotional journey and offers a tantalizing connection to Clarke’s broader literary universe. The only downside is the desire for more content, as the story leaves the reader craving further exploration.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her ability to adapt and deliver exquisite storytelling across different lengths and genres is unparalleled.  \n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  This short story is described as an \"anti-horror story,\" which defies conventional expectations.

The tone is unique and thought-provoking, leaving the reader to ponder its nature.  \n- **Themes and Emotional Resonance:**  \n  The story evokes a sense of wonder and introspection, reminiscent of *The Little Prince*. It’s filled with musings that resonate deeply, creating a lasting emotional impact.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I cannot recommend Susanna Clarke enough to any reader. Her work consistently delivers exceptional quality and originality, and this short story is no exception.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSusanna Clarke’s short story is a masterful piece that defies genre conventions, offering a unique and thought-provoking experience. It showcases her versatility as a writer and leaves a lasting impression with its emotional depth and musings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
