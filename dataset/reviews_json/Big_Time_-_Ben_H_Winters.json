            "This thriller is executed nearly to perfection, with a slow reveal that keeps readers engaged. Pacing is crucial in a story like this, and it feels more like a movie script than a traditional novel. Notably, there’s no Insta-Love or romance, which can often distract from the plot—unless, of course, you're John Le Carré.",
            "The story features well-developed and intriguing characters who, like the reader, initially feel lost and confused. Unlike typical heroes in batcaves or spaceships, the main characters lead relatable lives and grapple with familiar challenges.",
            "The story falls into the common trend of featuring female action heroes, showcasing their ability to perform incredible feats—like effortlessly jumping from moving vehicles and withstanding gunfire—while also embracing motherhood.",
            "I bought this book around 3 PM yesterday and finished it by 11:30 PM. The author truly knows how to craft a compelling story. Reading a gripping thriller like this one makes me ponder what sets it apart from the many flat and dull books out there."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This thriller is engaging and well-paced, featuring fully developed characters and a plot that keeps you hooked. However, it doesn't quite reach the heights of his previous work, the Last Policeman trilogy. The book feels more like a movie script and follows some modern trends, but it still manages to be an absorbing read. If you have a few hours to spare, this is a great way to escape into another world, though the author has written much better.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Engagement and Readability:**\n   - I purchased this book at about 3pm yesterday, and by 11:30pm had read it all the way through.\n   - Ben H. Winters knows how to tell a story.\n   - Reading a good thriller like this one makes me wonder what the magic is that makes a few of these books so absorbing while the majority are flat and dull.\n\n- **Comparison to Author's Previous Work:**\n   - This story doesn't exist on the same plane as the truly wonderful Last Policeman trilogy.\n   - I feel like the publishing industry has found a truly talented writer and then forced him to pump out and release books before he was quite ready.\n   - But Winters has written much, much better.\n\n- **Execution and Pacing:**\n   - The execution of this thriller was pretty close to perfect.\n   - Slow reveal drip-fed to the reader. Really, pacing is everything in a book like this.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - These unlikely creatures were fully fleshed out and interesting.\n   - Main characters, like the reader, feel lost and confused at the beginning.\n   - Main characters live recognizable lives with relatable problems, instead of hanging out in a batcave or spaceship or something.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - This one felt more like a movie script.\n   - It follows the ubiquitous pandering trend of making all the action heroes female (\"Look! I can kick ass and jump out of moving vehicles with minimal injury and absorb gunshots and make brand new little people!\").\n   - No Insta-Love or indeed any romance at all. (This can work in a thriller but is extraordinarily unlikely to serve as anything but a distraction, unless your name is John Le Carre.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis thriller by Ben H. Winters is engaging and well-paced, with fully fleshed-out characters and a plot that keeps you hooked. However, it doesn't quite reach the heights of his previous work, the Last Policeman trilogy. The book feels more like a movie script and follows some modern trends, but it still manages to be an absorbing read. If you have a few hours to spare, this is a great way to escape into another world, though Winters has written much better.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "In contrast to the slow burn of *The Quiet Boy*, this novel is a fast-paced thriller that captivates from start to finish. Its smooth structure, characterized by short chapters and relentless action, initially feels disjointed but ultimately converges beautifully. The story follows a classic thriller format with a unique twist—time travel. The author skillfully weaves Grace’s mundane FDA job into a crucial plot point, enhancing the intrigue. Additionally, the clever title adds a layer of wit that may not be immediately apparent.",
            "The book centers on three main characters: Allie, the kidnapped victim; Desiree, the kidnapper; and Grace, a single mother balancing her aging mother, a nonbinary teenager, and a tedious job at the FDA. Grace, in particular, serves as a relatable everywoman for the audience. Her journey from a mundane existence to being drawn into the unfolding drama is especially engaging.",
            "Although the author is often known for his more somber and intellectual style, this book is a delightful departure that prioritizes fun. It’s an excellent recommendation for anyone seeking an entertaining read."

The structure is smooth as silk, with quick chapters and constant action. It starts disjointed but eventually comes together beautifully.\n\n- **Appeal to a General Audience:**  \n  This is Winters' most appealing book for a general audience yet. It’s a straight-up thriller with multiple points of view, making it accessible and engaging for a wide range of readers.\n\n- **Tone and Mood:**  \n  While Winters can sometimes be depressing or cerebral, this book is just plain fun. It’s a refreshing departure from his usual tone, making it a great recommendation for anyone looking for an entertaining read.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book follows three main characters: Allie, who has been kidnapped; Desiree, the kidnapper; and Grace, a single mom juggling her aging mother, her nonbinary teen, and her boring job at the FDA. Grace, in particular, serves as a great everywoman proxy for the audience. Her transformation from a mundane life to being roped into the action is particularly enjoyable to watch.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is a classic thriller with a unique twist—time travel. Winters cleverly integrates Grace’s dull FDA job into a pivotal plot point, which adds an extra layer of intrigue. The book also features a joke title that isn’t immediately clear, adding a touch of wit.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**  \n  While *The Quiet Boy* was fantastic but slow, this book is a sprint from start to finish. It’s more accessible and has the potential to introduce new readers to Winters’ other works, like the *Last Policeman* series, which is one of the best (and bleakest) crime series around.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a great airplane read—a funky little page-turner that I feel comfortable recommending to pretty much anyone. It’s fast-paced, well-structured, and packed with action, making it Winters’ most appealing and enjoyable novel yet.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is fast-paced and engaging, though it does lag in a few sections. The ending is fantastic, providing a satisfying resolution to the suspenseful buildup. It explores the intriguing concept of time as currency, reminiscent of the movie *In Time*, yet with a distinct plot. The narrative begins with Allie, a middle school teacher, who is kidnapped and later discovers a mysterious portacath implanted in her chest. Grace, an FDA employee, investigates the device and uncovers a defunct company's plans to extract time as a \"durational element.\" The action-packed narrative, combined with a non-linear approach to time, adds depth and keeps readers on the edge of their seats.",
            "Allie is an everyday person thrown into extraordinary circumstances, making her relatable. Grace and her non-binary child, River, play pivotal roles in the investigation, adding emotional depth and a familial dynamic to the narrative. While the characters are engaging, I believe more backstory and development would have enriched their portrayal.",
            "This book prompts readers to consider ethical dilemmas surrounding power, wealth, and the exploitation of resources—specifically, time. It invites reflection on the morality of the characters' actions and decisions, exploring the consequences of the wealthy exploiting a powerful resource and its effects on the less fortunate.",
            "As a fan of *A Wrinkle in Time* for its exploration of non-linear time, I found this book's use of similar concepts to craft a captivating sci-fi narrative refreshing. Despite a few minor flaws, it was \"crazy in the best sense of the word\" and thoroughly enjoyable."

The narrative shifts in perspective, creating an urgent tone akin to that of sharp investigative TV shows.",

Additionally, the tender and endearing portrayal of characters adds depth, effectively balancing the intensity of the events they endure.",

And, eventually, to transfer it: to take time out of one person and give it to another, like a skin graft or an organ transplant.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBen Winters’ novel is a well-executed exploration of a familiar trope, enriched by strong character development, a satisfying conclusion, and thought-provoking scientific concepts.

Unfortunately, this novel doesn't come close to matching the quality of those.\n\n- **Opening and Premise:**  \n  The story opens promisingly with a 20-something school teacher on the run from a mysterious woman who has kidnapped her for unknown reasons. The teacher begins to experience confusing thoughts and memories, suggesting she isn't who she thinks she is. Early on, it becomes clear that she has been subjected to some kind of diabolical medical experiments.\n\n- **Character Development (Grace):**  \n  Grace, a divorced, frazzled, middle-rank FDA bureaucrat, is introduced as a \"regular\" person juggling an unfulfilling job in the DC suburbs, a challenging teenage kid, and an annoying mother.

The stakes and logic of the story often feel unclear, and the pacing fails to build the necessary tension.\n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  One standout moment involves the partial verification of a character's identity through a photo from a 'zine in the University of Maryland Library's DC Punk archival collection. This detail feels authentic and adds a layer of intrigue, likely reflecting the author's personal connection to the punk scene.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The denouement and epilogue are underwhelming, leaving the story feeling unresolved and unsatisfying. It's hard to imagine who the target audience for this book would be.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel starts with an intriguing premise and features some memorable moments, it ultimately falls short as both a thriller and speculative fiction.

While this approach sometimes leads to great discoveries, it often doesn’t work out, and this book was one of those disappointments.  \n\n- **Scientific Plausibility (Science Fiction Element):**  \n   - The science in this science fiction novel was weak and implausible. The central premise—that each person carries a quantum of time that can be extracted and redistributed—lacked any semblance of scientific explanation. This undermined my ability to suspend disbelief throughout the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were disappointingly one-dimensional and relied heavily on stock types: the evil capitalist, the ruthless professional killer, the improbable soccer mom hero, and a non-binary teenager, which felt like a token addition to modern tropes. None of them felt original or compelling.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Originality:**  \n   - The plot followed a predictable, by-the-numbers thriller formula. It was designed to bring the protagonists together in a remote location for the inevitable showdown, complete with deaths and revelations. While the pacing was decent, the lack of surprises or originality left me consistently disappointed.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Work:**  \n   - I later realized I had read another book by this author, *Golden State*, which was significantly better than this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book failed to meet my expectations due to its implausible science, lackluster characters, and predictable plot. While the pacing was decent, it wasn’t enough to salvage the overall experience. I’ll continue my search for hidden gems at the Festival of Books, hoping for better luck next time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Winters' work, and I definitely want to read more after binging *BIG TIME*.  \n  - I appreciated the level of explanation and detail we got when the science of it all was described.  \n\n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  - The premise is simple yet fascinating: a scientist discovers that time is something individually embedded in each human being and can be extracted and given to someone else.  \n  - The concept left me living in fear that time can be traded and/or stolen.  \n\n- **Characters and Representation:**  \n  - The three women around whom the narrative evolves are all wildly different and in their own crises, leading us into a wildly adventurous journey.  \n  - One of the women has a non-binary child that was incredibly well-written and didn’t rely on any annoying tropes tied to TGNC (Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming) characters.  \n\n- **Genre and Appeal:**  \n  - This was a great dip back into the sci-fi pool for me.  \n  - I will definitely be recommending this one to a few friends.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Many thanks to Mulholland Books and Netgalley for providing an ARC of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBen H. Winters' *BIG TIME* is a captivating sci-fi novel with a unique premise, well-developed characters, and thoughtful representation. The detailed scientific explanations and adventurous narrative made it a standout read for me, and I look forward to exploring more of Winters' work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The time travel element added an intriguing layer to the story, creating suspense and unpredictability.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending, however, was a bit disappointing. While I understand that time travel often leads to alternative realities, I was let down by the revelation that the main character we had been following from the start didn’t actually exist in the final reality. This twist felt jarring and left me questioning the emotional investment I had made in the character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, \"Big Time\" is an enjoyable science fiction novel with strong female leads, a gripping plot, and a unique focus on medical science. While the ending was a letdown, the book still provided several hours of entertainment and is worth reading for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 (rounded down to 3 stars due to the disappointing ending)."
