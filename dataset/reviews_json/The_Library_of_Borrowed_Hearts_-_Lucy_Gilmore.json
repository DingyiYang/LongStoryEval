            "The novel unfolds across dual timelines, intertwining a love story from the 1960s with a contemporary romance. Central to the plot is Chloe Sampson, a librarian striving to care for her three young siblings. She stumbles upon a rare book from the 1960s filled with handwritten messages, which connects her to her cantankerous neighbor, Jasper Holmes, and uncovers past and present relationships. Although the first half may seem slow and underwhelming, the story ultimately transforms into a poignant exploration of family ties and personal growth. As the narrative deepens and the timelines converge, the pacing improves, leading to a satisfying and heartwarming conclusion.",

Jasper, initially portrayed as grumpy, reveals a softer, almost marshmallow-like side as he grows closer to Chloe's family. Meanwhile, Zack adds a charming flair to the mix. The evolving dynamics among the characters—and the unexpected family they create—are both emotionally resonant and skillfully developed.",
            "The narrative is enriched with literary references and quotes that add depth and sophistication. Lines such as, “You know, the thing I’ve always loved most about books is how they make it possible to live a thousand different lives,” and “If you don’t like where you are, you don’t have to pack up your whole family and abandon everything you know and love. All you have to do is grab a different story from the shelf,” are especially poignant and memorable.",
            "This novel delves into themes of family, love, and resilience, examining the ways relationships can be both dismantled and rebuilt. It powerfully showcases how books and stories forge connections across time and circumstance. The emotional journey is poignant, featuring moments that moved me to tears. The integration of quotes and references from classic literature adds depth and relatability, underscoring how narratives reflect and influence our lives."

            "This story is a refreshing departure from what I've read recently, employing multiple perspectives and timelines. It occasionally feels disjointed, yet it ultimately comes together beautifully. Centered around Chloe, a librarian caring for her siblings, and Jasper Holmes, a curmudgeonly elder, the narrative revolves around their quest to solve a mystery involving a rare edition of a banned book.

Catherine is a complex character; while I may not agree with all her choices, I understood her motivations. Her journey, though familiar, remained engaging and enjoyable to read.",

Initially intending to sell it, she discovers love notes scrawled in its margins, hinting at a romance that flows through other classic works as well. To her astonishment, her grumpy elderly neighbor—who stubbornly keeps the frisbees that stray into his yard—offers her a blank check for the book. Every word drew me deeper into the writer's captivating world.",

            "You cannot dictate how others feel; your actions have weight. People can't just walk away and return as if nothing happened. We are real, complex individuals, not mere background characters that vanish when the narrative shifts. I find solace in the ability to always discover a new book for fresh perspectives or revisit an old favorite when I need companionship.",

It’s a tale that will stay with you long after the last page, claiming a permanent place in your heart."

            "The pacing was excellent, and the story felt both vital and compelling, particularly in how Chloe's quest to conclude Jasper's narrative mirrored her own existential struggles.",
            "Chloe emerges as a captivating protagonist, her dry humor consistently eliciting laughter. Her engaging banter with Zach adds to the story’s charm, while her poignant decision to leave college to care for her three younger siblings resonates deeply. Jasper, on the other hand, presents a heartbreaking yet intriguing character; his sorrowful existence combined with a fragile, sensitive heart makes him unforgettable and left me in tears. However, the dynamic between Catherine and Jasper felt uneven. Although Jasper's love for her is genuine, Catherine appears more intrigued by his tough exterior and gentle nature, which starkly contrasts with her father's demeanor and that of his subordinates.",

The author refreshingly emphasizes that love alone isn't enough to sustain a partnership. The second half of the book is particularly impactful, eliciting strong emotions that make it difficult to hold back tears. The contrast between Jasper and Catherine's love story and Zach and Chloe's relationship is skillfully executed; while hints of similarity exist, their differences ultimately take center stage.",
            "This book evoked a broad spectrum of emotions, from laughter to heartbreak. I was particularly moved by Chloe's loneliness, even in a crowded space, as well as Jasper's tragic existence."

She will do anything for her family, and I respect that immensely.  \n   - Zach was definitely a heartthrob, and I ate up every bit of him. He was so sweet and respectful, and I think he and Chloe end up having their happy ending. They seem endgame to me.  \n   - My favorite character of all has to be Jasper. He had such a character arc that it was hard for him NOT to be my favorite. Rough around the edges but a secret hopeless romantic...everything you could ever ask for in a man (in my own humble opinion).  \n\n- **Romantic Relationships and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - Jasper and Catherine's reunion had me sobbing in the club for real. It was so sweet and so sad. It makes me hope and pray I never have a love story that ends like that.  \n   - Knowing and seeing that Jasper was so lonely, depressed, and isolated because his love left him made my heart hurt.  \n   - I loved how he showed Catherine his love through books. That was very romantic, and I would die if anyone annotated a book for me.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The book explores themes of love, loss, and resilience. Jasper and Catherine’s story, in particular, highlights the pain of unfulfilled love and the enduring power of connection.  \n   - The idea that books are living, breathing entities that change each time you pick them up resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Quotes:**  \n   - The writing is filled with poignant and memorable quotes, such as:  \n     - \"Towns would come and go, and so would the people in her life, but there was always a friend inside the pages of a book.\" (Pg 35)  \n     - \"Books were always trying to teach us that the power of love could overcome any hardship and that money didn't buy happiness.\" (Pg 145)  \n     - \"In many ways, books were more alive than most of the people he knew. They were living, breathing entities that changed each time you picked them up.\" (Pg 213)  \n     - \"'You don't get to decide how other people feel. The things you do matter.'\" (Pg 299)  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The different perspectives paired with the different eras and love stories being unfolded were so perfect and amazing.  \n   - Overall, I rate this book 5/5 stars for its romance, humor, and slice-of-life elements.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a beautifully crafted story that weaves together multiple love stories across different eras, with deeply relatable characters and emotional depth. The themes of love, loss, and resilience are explored through memorable quotes and a writing style that feels alive.

            "About two-thirds of the way through, I questioned how the story could possibly conclude well for Jasper. However, the unexpected resolution and its connections were executed brilliantly. The satisfying ending left me pleasantly surprised.",

            "The margin notes in the story prompted me to ponder my own feelings about annotated books. While I typically prefer clean, unmarked pages, the writing here felt more like a love story than mere commentary, which I found charming. There was one distracting typo with quotation marks, but aside from that, the writing was impeccable.",
            "I'm left wondering whether Jasper cashed the $5,000 check and if his offer of the same amount to Chloe for the book was intended as a metaphor. The flowers Jasper planted around his yard added a charming touch, though, as an English teacher, I felt a bit embarrassed not to recognize all of them. I appreciated that the story didn't shy away from less conventional resolutions, which made it feel more realistic and impactful. The theme of older characters healing from past wounds and sharing wisdom with younger generations resonated deeply with me. The portrayal of the wise old man was beautifully executed, reinforcing my affection for this theme.",
            "This book prompted me to reflect on the value of learning from other generations and the importance of understanding their perspectives. I particularly appreciated the exploration of love stories from 60 years ago, which added a nostalgic and emotionally rich layer to the narrative."

The multiple narrators, unexpected ending, and exploration of intergenerational wisdom made it a deeply satisfying read. Despite a minor typo, the writing was excellent, and the story left me reflecting on life, love, and the value of shared experiences across generations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5/5"

            "The open-ended conclusion left me eager for a sequel or epilogue. While it invited interpretation, I felt unsettled about the fates of certain characters, especially Jasper. The narrative's exploration of love, sacrifice, and survival was compelling, but I craved more closure and development on specific plotlines.",
            "Jasper's character struck a deep chord with me; I felt heartbroken for him. He truly deserved happiness, yet his emotional depth and selflessness were both admirable and tragic. Chloe's journey, on the other hand, brought me joy, especially for her and the children. Her growth and resilience were truly inspiring. Catherine elicited mixed feelings; while I disapproved of her actions and lack of remorse, I couldn't help but admire her intelligence, strategic thinking, and independence in overcoming challenges. Zach's limited involvement was disappointing, as I wished for more insight into his character and role in the story.",
            "The prose in this narrative is evocative and beautifully crafted, exemplified by lines like, “Jasper always carried extra emotion wherever he went. It followed him and bound him at the same time,” which highlight the author’s skill in conveying complex emotions. Additionally, the incorporation of literary references such as *Tropic of Cancer* and *The Princess Bride* enriches the story, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "The emotional depth of Jasper and Catherine's relationship is profoundly moving. Lines such as, “He was in too deep, too fast, so lost in her that he was in danger of drowning forever,” and “There was no combination of letters in any language that could match the way it felt to have her body next to him,” beautifully convey the intensity of their connection. Additionally, the portrayal of poverty through Jasper’s eyes is both poignant and thought-provoking, emphasizing the harsh realities of life and his unwavering commitment to protecting Catherine from such hardships."

        "conclusion": "This novel was a deeply emotional and thought-provoking read, with well-developed characters and a compelling exploration of love, sacrifice, and survival. While the open-ended conclusion left me wanting more, the story’s emotional depth and beautiful prose made it a memorable experience. I particularly connected with Jasper’s character and felt a mix of heartbreak and admiration for Catherine. A sequel or epilogue would be a welcome addition to provide closure.",

            "I appreciated the book's seamless transition between the present and the 1960s, with both storylines captivating my attention throughout. The constant plot twists were genuinely surprising and left me in awe. However, Part Five didn't deliver the closure I was hoping for, as I felt Chloe’s mom and Catherine should have faced greater consequences for their actions. While I would have liked an epilogue, the story still provided a satisfying resolution overall.",

The dual timelines are easy to follow, and the author skillfully provides just the right amount of detail to convey each storyline effectively.",

The handling of the POV characters is skillful, with their perspectives enriching the narrative.",

The depiction of library work and book preservation could be more accurate. Additionally, Catherine's advice to Chloe regarding book-related careers comes across as dismissive and biased, which I find concerning.",

Jasper’s character and the book references alone make it worth picking up.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

I appreciate that the story makes a point of showcasing libraries, as it’s important to draw attention to them.  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The novel had two love stories entwined, but it never felt too busy or chaotic. The plot played out beautifully, maintaining a good balance throughout.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  I could have done without the resurgence of their POS mother, who shouldn’t even be called a mother. This aspect of the story felt unnecessary and detracted from my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel to be a charming and well-paced story with a strong emphasis on libraries, which I loved. The dual love stories were engaging and well-executed, though the inclusion of the mother character felt out of place and unnecessary.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Chloe's challenges as the legal guardian of her three younger siblings and her financial struggles are portrayed effectively. Jasper, Chloe’s antisocial next-door neighbor, adds complexity to the narrative, while Zach, a rugged and charming character, kept me engaged with his appealing pick-up artist charm. Overall, the romance could have been more compelling.",

This revelation was heartbreaking, as he spent decades in misery over a lie.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and some emotionally impactful moments, the pacing felt slow, and the plot lacked significant development. The dual timeline structure and character dynamics had potential but fell short in execution.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "The story would have benefited from a more consistent structure, perhaps as a trilogy, to give each character the opportunity to shine. The abrupt introduction and removal of Chloe's mom and modern-day Catherine felt unnecessary. Additionally, Pepper and Lonnie were underutilized, despite their potential significance in Chloe and Catherine's lives. The modern-day romance also felt one-sided and lacked depth, which was disappointing given its potential.",
            "In the second half of the story, the main character's personality becomes less dynamic, resulting in a flatter portrayal as additional points of view are introduced. Jasper's abrupt shift in attitude toward his neighbors feels unrealistic. The decision to use second-person POV for some characters while others are in third-person is jarring. Additionally, there are instances in Noodle's POV where the writing feels inconsistent, as if it were intended for a different character.",
            "The opening lines of the book struck a chord with me as a mid-20s library worker without a degree who finds comfort in books over real-life experiences. The protagonist's journey—navigating library work, managing diverse tasks, and grappling with the emotional burden of discarding old books—reflects my own experiences and interests, especially regarding mid-20th century America.",
            "This book was a surprisingly quick read for me—I finished it in just 36 hours. It masterfully blends modern mystery with 1960s romance, featuring clues cleverly hidden in the margins of old library books."

        "conclusion": "This book is a heartfelt tribute to books and libraries, with a compelling mix of mystery and romance.

            "The story follows Chloe Sampson, a young woman balancing the care of her three siblings with her job as a librarian. When she discovers a rare book filled with marginal notes from two lovers, she unravels a past love affair involving her neighbor, Jasper. The narrative skillfully alternates between the present and the past, revealing the poignant love story of Catherine and Jasper, which keeps the reader engaged. The scavenger hunt element adds intrigue and propels Chloe’s journey forward. However, the ending feels abrupt, leaving several loose ends unresolved. Readers are left questioning Chloe’s future, Zach’s role in her life, the fate of her siblings, and the possibility of her mother’s return. The absence of an epilogue or additional closure detracts from the overall satisfaction of the story.",
            "Chloe is a compelling protagonist, balancing strength with vulnerability. Her devotion to her siblings and passion for books make her both relatable and endearing. Jasper experiences significant character growth, evolving from a reclusive curmudgeon to someone who reconnects with life and others. His love for literature and rich backstory make him a standout figure. In contrast, Catherine, Jasper’s former lover, comes across as selfish, diminishing her likability and foreshadowing her lack of a happy ending. Zach, a local man who assists Chloe, is charming, though his actions can be frustrating at times. His bond with Chloe’s family, particularly with Noodle, adds a heartwarming touch to the narrative.",
            "The author's writing is commendable for its smooth flow and excellent pacing, making the story engaging and easy to read. The five points of view are skillfully managed, with clear distinctions between characters, and the chapter titles enhance clarity. The author adeptly balances the present-day narrative with the historical love story, ensuring that both elements feel cohesive.",
            "The theme of found family is central to the story, making Chloe's quest to build a supportive community both heartwarming and relatable. The narrative highlights the power of literature to forge connections, particularly through Chloe's bond with Jasper and her own love for reading. Although the story includes romantic elements, it leans more toward contemporary fiction or chick lit than traditional romance."

While the abrupt ending leaves some questions unanswered, the themes of found family and the love of books make it a heartwarming and memorable read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from the author.",

            "The book employs dual timelines and multiple points of view, including those of Chloe, Catherine, Jasper, Noodle, and the forest guy. While both timelines are engaging, they become repetitive around the middle. By the 60% mark, the story's direction feels predictable, leaving me eager for the conclusion. Some perspectives, particularly Noodle's, seem unnecessary and fail to enhance the narrative. Additionally, older Jasper's inner monologue comes across as more of a caricature than a fully developed character.",
            "Chloe, the protagonist, is a relatable and proud character who grapples with the responsibility of caring for her siblings after their mother departs. Her determination and reluctance to accept help make her a compelling figure. While most characters are likable, some, like older Jasper, lack depth. It would have been more engaging to explore his personality through interactions with others rather than relying on his inner monologue.",
            "The book is charming and heartwarming, culminating in a happy ending that feels somewhat overly tidy and forgiving. Some character reactions to significant life events come across as unrealistic, though this may stem from my own cynicism. Additionally, the reliance on a particular trope (which I won't disclose to avoid spoilers) was a drawback for me; while it may be relatable, it felt clichéd and diminished my overall enjoyment."

            "The story follows Chloe, a librarian and caretaker of her three siblings, who stumbles upon an old, banned book in the library's basement. This discovery sparks a scavenger hunt for more books, drawing in her grumpy neighbor, Jasper, in an unexpected way. The narrative unfolds across two timelines: the present day and the 1960s. While the present-day storyline is more engaging, the 1960s segments feel overly drawn out. The hunt for older books and the revelations that accompany them are enjoyable, though the final twist may be predictable for readers familiar with light romance.",
            "Chloe is a relatable protagonist, skillfully balancing her responsibilities and financial challenges. Her potential love interest, Zach, best friend Pepper, and grumpy neighbor Jasper are all well-developed and engaging. Chloe's siblings add heart, drama, and a touch of mischief to the narrative. While Catherine, a character from the 1960s timeline, is less likable, her actions are understandable within the context of her era.",
            "In her novel, Lucy Gilmore skillfully weaves the concept of marginalia—notes in the margins of books—into the central plot, adding an intriguing intellectual layer to the narrative. The dual timelines and interconnected lives of the characters are crafted adeptly, although the 1960s storyline could have benefited from greater conciseness."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Library of Borrowed Hearts* is an engaging and heartwarming novel with a unique premise centered around books and marginalia. While the 1960s timeline felt drawn out, the present-day storyline and well-crafted characters make it a worthwhile read. The audiobook narration adds an extra layer of enjoyment, particularly in the second half. Overall, it’s a delightful choice for fans of light romance and literary-themed stories.",

This dual timeline and shifting points of view enrich the narrative, adding depth and intrigue. The plot unfolds at a brisk pace, combining elements of mystery, romance, and family drama. I was particularly engaged by the discovery of hidden messages in books and the ensuing quest for other volumes. While the ending fell somewhat short of expectations, it remained cohesive within the overall context of the story.",

Each character is distinct and well-developed, making them both memorable and relatable.",

It delves into themes of love, resilience, and family ties, as Chloe navigates her responsibilities towards her siblings while unraveling the mystery of the books."

            "The mystery of the love-noted books, discovered by Chloe years later, adds an intriguing layer of suspense. The deception experienced by both Jasper and Chloe within the same family prompts thought-provoking questions about forgiveness and trust, making it an excellent topic for book club discussions. However, the story would benefit from reducing Chloe’s self-pitying moments, which become repetitive and detract from her character's appeal.",
            "I appreciated the likable characters, even the one who took time to grow on me. Jasper and Chloe, despite their generational differences, both exhibit a caring nature and a sense of responsibility toward their siblings. Jasper's gruff exterior hides a deep compassion, while Chloe's self-pity can be a bit tiresome, though it aligns with her character.",
            "As a retired librarian, I found the library setting and the personalities of the staff particularly engaging. The small-town air force radar base backdrop enriched the narrative, especially through Catherine’s story as the daughter of an air force captain. This setting resonated with me personally, as my father was also stationed at a small-town air force radar base, albeit with different dynamics.",
            "The romance between Catherine and Jasper, conveyed through cryptic notes in library books, was undeniably charming, though I found it sacrilegious to write in such texts! Catherine's rebellious spirit and her sudden decision to end the relationship, leaving Jasper to believe she had died, added significant emotional depth to the story."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I found the novel engaging, with its likeable characters, romantic elements, and intriguing mystery.

The themes of deception and forgiveness offer rich material for discussion, making it a worthwhile read despite its flaws.",

The time changes were unexpected but added depth to the story, making it more engaging than a single POV would have. However, nearing the end, a couple of extra POV chapters felt unnecessary and made the story feel slightly jumbled.  \n\n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n  I thought this was a beautiful story with an interesting premise. The idea of a mystery involving two lovers through books was captivating. Themes of love, family dynamics, and redemption were explored in a heartfelt way.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were interesting and well done, even the tropey ones felt multidimensional. I enjoyed seeing them open up to each other and explore their pasts. The \"grumpy old neighbor opens up after helping some kids\" trope was particularly enjoyable, reminiscent of *A Man Called Ove*.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  The story resonated deeply, especially with the portrayal of a shy, awkward, overly sensitive man struggling to reconcile his inner world with the external one. The emotional weight of his inability to fully express his feelings added a poignant layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  The family dynamics between Chloe and her siblings were intriguing and added richness to the story. The interactions and redemptions among the characters were well-executed and satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a beautifully crafted story with a compelling premise, well-developed characters, and unexpected twists. While the pacing was slower and the ending felt slightly jumbled with extra POVs, the emotional depth, family dynamics, and character growth made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 STARS  \n\n**Trigger Warnings:**  \nChild abandonment, injury."

            "Chloe Sampson, who sacrificed her dreams to care for her siblings after their mother left, now works at a library instead of pursuing a career as a librarian due to her incomplete degree. While in the library basement, she stumbles upon an old book marked for disposal, filled with marginalia that reveals a correspondence between young lovers.

The narrative alternates between the present and the past, unfolding the love story of the couple who wrote in the book.

The dual timelines, multiple perspectives, and abundance of book quotes made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  My only wish is that the story moved a bit faster. For about the first half of the book, I wasn’t sure how everything would come together, but it did so beautifully in the end.  \n\n- **Format and Narration:**  \n  I jumped between the audio, physical, and digital copies depending on where I was. The audio version was particularly enjoyable and helpful in keeping track of the multiple perspectives.  \n\n- **Cover and Initial Appeal:**  \n  The colorful cover and the word “Library” in the title immediately drew me in and made me want to read the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Library of Borrowed Hearts* is a charming and well-crafted novel that combines a love story with a literary treasure hunt. While the pacing could have been quicker in the beginning, the story ultimately came together beautifully. The multiple formats, especially the audio version, enhanced the reading experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 /5"

Chloe is a librarian who is just trying to make it and take care of her siblings. Jasper is an outwardly curmudgeon of an older man who is really just a huge softy with an enormous heart. He reminds me of Ove from Backman's *A Man Called Ove*, which is just about the best compliment I could give to an old male character.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  I listened to this one on audio, and the narration was well done. Multiple narrators are always ideal with multiple POVs and a shifting timeline, and I enjoyed this one a lot.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Ultimately, this one is a fun, enjoyable, and smart contemporary summer read. I immediately snagged a paper copy of Gilmore's previous novel, *The Lonely Hearts Book Club*, from the library to take with me on vacation next week.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a smart, fun literary romance that blends emotional depth, memorable characters, and clever literary references.

It added depth and variety to the storytelling.\n\n- **Character Dynamics (Catherine and Her Mother):**\n   - I struggled with Catherine’s mom. Catherine held her in high regard, even though she allowed Catherine to lie to the father of her child. I don’t understand why they felt it was okay to make that decision for Jasper.\n\n- **Jasper’s Character Arc:**\n   - Jasper shut himself off from the world and grieved for over 50 years. Then, he doesn’t even let Catherine apologize. He forgives her for keeping his son from him, which felt like a missed opportunity for a deeper resolution. This part of the book made me mad.\n\n- **Themes of Forgiveness and Redemption:**\n   - Jasper’s forgiveness of Catherine, despite her keeping his son from him, felt like a chance for happiness—even from afar—but it left me conflicted.\n\n- **Chloe and Her Mother’s Conflict:**\n   - I didn’t mind the conflict between Chloe and her mom. I never thought Chloe’s mom was similar to Catherine, even though the book tried to paint them as parallels. Both women left their families, but their reasons were different.\n\n- **Motivations for Leaving:**\n   - Jasper emphasized the differences in why the two women left. I think both left for selfish reasons: Chloe’s mom because she couldn’t handle the responsibility of having four children and wanted freedom, and Catherine because she couldn’t handle the judgment from others and desired freedom to raise the baby on her own, though she claimed it was to keep Jasper from breaking his back for two more mouths.\n\n- **Complex Relationships and Family Dynamics:**\n   - The novel explores complex relationships and the shifting definition of family, which I found compelling and thought-provoking.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I really enjoyed this novel despite some frustrations with certain character decisions and dynamics.

            "The story left me with a few unresolved plot points that were bothersome. For instance, Jasper's sudden wealth, despite his difficult upbringing, was never explained. Additionally, Ravenna's pivotal \"Until the\" moment received considerable attention but lacked clarity, which was unsatisfying. I also found it puzzling that some readers viewed Catherine negatively or felt the ending was abrupt; both elements made sense to me and felt fitting within the narrative.",
            "The characters often came across as exaggerated caricatures, lacking realism. Theo and Trixie, in particular, felt more like young children than teenagers, which undermined their believability.",

My favorite quote was from Emily Brontë’s *Wuthering Heights*: “I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free... Why am I so changed?”  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My favorite character was Chloe. She was long-suffering and always put others' needs ahead of her own. In contrast, my least favorite character was her mother, who was essentially the opposite of Chloe.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  The love affair between Jasper and Catherine was interesting, but I wasn’t particularly drawn to either character. I didn’t really like Catherine; she seemed spoiled and arrogant, always thinking she knew more than everyone else.

            "I appreciated the multiple perspectives that enriched the story, though I found the use of different narrators for each gender a bit challenging—this is more a matter of personal preference. What truly sets this book apart is its realistic ending, which shuns a tidy, storybook conclusion. Instead, it reflects the unpredictability of real life, where outcomes may not align with our desires but unfold as they are meant to. The author executes this theme beautifully."

I liked that so many of the characters were book people.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I think the dual timeline worked well to both move the story along and build anticipation in each timeline. It was also interesting to draw parallels between young Catherine and Jasper and current Chloe and Zach.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I would categorize the ending as uplifting, maybe happy for now, but not really happily ever after.  \n\n- **Appeal and Themes:**  \n  I think The Library of Borrowed Hearts can appeal to readers for many different reasons. There is an intriguing bookish mystery, romantic elements, and the dual timeline provides a slightly historical fiction viewpoint of what it was like to fall in love with someone with vastly different means sixty years ago.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, The Library of Borrowed Hearts is a charming novel with a mix of mystery, romance, and historical elements. The dual timeline and relatable characters make it an engaging read, though the ending feels more like a hopeful pause than a definitive conclusion.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

With the help of a new romantic interest, Chloe uncovers more books with similar notes, leading her to believe her neighbor might be connected to the love story. I found the plot engaging and enjoyed the dual timelines—the 1960s love story and Chloe’s present-day journey. It was a sweet, escapist read, though not the most memorable.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Chloe is a relatable protagonist, juggling her responsibilities and her curiosity about the mysterious love story. Her neighbor, initially portrayed as crabby, adds intrigue to the narrative. The romantic interest who helps Chloe in her detective work is a nice addition, though not deeply explored. The characters from the 1960s love story are compelling, and their connection to the present-day plot is well-executed.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told through two alternating points of view—the 1960s love story and Chloe’s present-day narrative. I thought this structure was done quite well, balancing both timelines effectively. The writing is light and easy to follow, making it a pleasant read.  \n\n- **Audio Narration:**  \n  I listened to about 60% of the book and found the audio narration enjoyable. It enhanced my experience, especially while multitasking like walking or cooking. The narration added to the escapism I was seeking.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  This book reminded me of the author’s previous work, particularly in its themes of a librarian befriending a curmudgeon and the inclusion of literary references. However, I enjoyed the plot of this one more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a sweet, enjoyable novel with a well-structured dual timeline and engaging characters. While it wasn’t the most memorable book, it provided a nice escape and was a pleasant read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars (rounded to 4).  \n\nThank you to NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca for the ARC to review."

            "The premise of the story is intriguing: Chloe Sampson, a struggling librarian, stumbles upon a rare book filled with handwritten notes, which leads her to uncover a decades-old love story. While the dual timelines and multiple perspectives add depth, the pacing is sluggish. The 1960s storyline feels underdeveloped and lacks substance. Although several subplots and characters are introduced, many come across as inconsequential and unresolved. The plot points are predictable and weak, making it hard to stay engaged. Ultimately, the ending is unsatisfying and leaves many questions unanswered.",

Her interactions with friends and siblings were delightful, with Noodle standing out as a favorite character. Jasper Holmes, the grumpy elderly neighbor, added depth and charm to the narrative. However, the subplot concerning Chloe’s relationship with her mother felt disappointing and underdeveloped.",
            "I have a deep appreciation for stories that revolve around books, libraries, and bookstores, and this novel beautifully highlights how literature can unite people. The literary references and the idea of using books as a form of communication were particularly delightful."

The audiobook narration was excellent, but the story itself fell short of my expectations. This was my second novel by this author, and unfortunately, it didn’t fully satisfy me. However, others may enjoy it more, so I recommend checking additional reviews before deciding to read it.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Audio Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook was brilliantly narrated by Leanne Woodward, Aven Shore, Joe Jameson, and Bob Ball.  \n   - I’m glad I opted for the audiobook, as the story might have felt tedious in print.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n   - The premise was intriguing: a struggling librarian, Chloe Sampson, discovers a rare book with handwritten notes in the margins, leading her to uncover a decades-old love story.  \n   - The dual timelines and multiple perspectives added depth, but the story moved too slowly for my liking.  \n   - The 1960s storyline felt underdeveloped and left a lot to be desired.  \n   - Several subplots and characters were introduced, but many felt inconsequential and unresolved.  \n   - The plot points were predictable, weak, and unconvincing, making it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Chloe is an endearing protagonist, though I questioned some of her choices as the story progressed.  \n   - Her dynamic with her friends and siblings was enjoyable (Noodle was a favorite character).  \n   - Jasper Holmes, the grumpy elderly neighbor, was likable and added depth to the story.  \n   - The subplot involving Chloe’s relationship with her mother was disappointing and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting:**  \n   - I love stories centered around books, libraries, and bookstores, and this novel emphasized how books can bring people together.  \n   - The literary references and the concept of using books as a means of communication were delightful.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending felt unsatisfying and unconvincing, leaving me with unanswered questions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Library of Borrowed Hearts* by Lucy Gilmore had an intriguing premise and some charming elements, the slow pacing, underdeveloped subplots, and predictable plot points made it difficult to stay engaged. The audiobook narration was excellent, but the story itself fell short of my expectations. This was my second Lucy Gilmore novel, and unfortunately, it didn’t fully satisfy me. However, others may enjoy it more, so I recommend checking additional reviews before deciding to read it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Audio Narration: 4⭐  \n- Plot: 2.5⭐"

            "This book masterfully weaves a dual timeline filled with a whirlwind romance and swoon-worthy note exchanges, creating an engaging narrative. With its multi-POV structure, letter exchanges, and a literary scavenger hunt, it captivates the reader. However, I found the ending unsatisfying, leaving too many questions unanswered. I always feel frustrated when a book concludes without an epilogue, and this one is no exception. Overall, it feels incomplete.",

The unexplained event profoundly impacts several characters, leaving a lasting emotional effect. At times, the protagonist comes across as selfish and flaky, which adds complexity to her character.",

While there are a few secondary plots, the primary focus remains on unraveling the mystery of the 1960s couple and their heartfelt notes.",

Central themes of lost love, books, and libraries make it particularly appealing to bibliophiles and library enthusiasts."

However, the lack of depth in the main character’s personality, the unrealistic portrayal of book-loving characters, and the missed opportunity for stronger emotional impact kept it from being a 5-star read for me. With some adjustments, this could have been a truly unforgettable story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5"

            "The pacing of the story felt uneven, with the mystery and emotional moments taking too long to develop. A more balanced structure would have helped maintain momentum throughout the novel. I appreciate an unlikely friendship and a good mystery, and the premise here was intriguing. Chloe, who works at a library after dropping out of college to care for her siblings, stumbles upon a love affair hidden in the margins of library books and sets out to uncover the truth. When her brother breaks his leg, Jasper, the grumpy next-door neighbor, unexpectedly becomes her ally. While the concept is compelling, I found that the depth of the mystery and its resolution arrived too late to fully engage me.",

The concept of characters forming a close-knit, non-traditional family resonated with me.  \n\n- **Unique Communication Method:**  \n  I also liked how they communicated through library books; I found it a fun and unique concept.  \n\n- **Plot Excitement:**  \n  The book didn't fully take off for me; it was missing an excitement factor in the plot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I cared about Jasper and Catherine, but many of the other characters were one-dimensional and forgettable.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth:**  \n  The emotional response in this book seemed muted. They talk so much about *Wuthering Heights* and other classic literature, yet where are the emotions in this book? When I first read *Wuthering Heights*, it wrecked me. I know this book wasn't trying to be *Wuthering Heights* or *A Farewell to Arms*, but at least give us more feelings! You can't just say the character was sad in one sentence. You have to describe their woe, the agony of their heart, the languishing, etc.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  One interesting note: during the last few chapters, I audibly gasped at something one of the characters said because it was so horrible and cold. If one of my relatives said that about one of my siblings, I would be very angry.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  For an example of a book that had the found family theme and brought all the emotions, check out *Family, Family* by Laurie Frankel. Gorgeous book, five stars.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was just okay for me. While I appreciated the found family theme and the unique communication method, the lack of plot excitement, emotional depth, and well-developed characters left me wanting more.

            "The synopsis was intriguing, but the execution did not meet my expectations. The story follows a young woman caring for her three younger siblings after their mother abandons them. When she discovers a forgotten taboo novel in the library, featuring correspondence between two secret lovers from the 1960s, she embarks on a quest to uncover their story. While the plot had potential, it felt overcrowded with multiple subplots: the older sister's responsibilities, the mother's departure, a love interest who rescues her brother, the found family trope, the past love story, and present-day reconnections. The ending left many loose ends, resulting in unanswered questions. I would have preferred a stronger focus on the central theme of the past love story, along with more backstory on the mother’s motivations and struggles.

            "The novel began with great promise, and I was initially excited about it. However, the author attempted to juggle too many plots, resulting in an inconsistent and disjointed narrative. The frequent shifts between storylines made it difficult to stay engaged; just as I became invested in one plot, it would abruptly change to another that held less interest for me. A single narrator or perhaps two would have helped maintain focus. The intertwining of Chloe’s story with Jasper and Catherine’s felt unbalanced, and I believe separating them into two distinct books—one for Chloe and another for Jasper and Catherine—would have allowed for deeper development of each narrative. Additionally, Chloe’s mother’s subplot seemed unnecessary and detracted from the main arcs. The switch to Noodle’s point of view felt forced, as if it were a last-ditch effort to add intrigue, ultimately diminishing his character and making him appear inconsistent—intelligent when the plot required it, yet otherwise childish and lacking depth.",

Jasper is portrayed as a grouchy old man with a heart, while Chloe is depicted as a caring sister with a tough exterior, but neither character is explored beyond these surface traits. Additionally, Noodle’s perspective feels out of place and unnecessary, reducing him to a plot device rather than a fully realized character."

            "This novel offers a charming, if somewhat saccharine, exploration of family—both biological and chosen—set against the backdrop of a book-related mystery in a rural Washington library. The dual narrative structure, alternating between Chloe's contemporary challenges and the 1960 romance of Catherine and Jasper, enriches the story with depth and intrigue. The mystery surrounding the marginalia in books like *The Tropic of Cancer* and *A Farewell to Arms* effectively weaves the timelines together. Although the conclusion lacks originality, it is executed in a pleasantly satisfying manner.",

The pacing felt slow at first, but it picked up for me about halfway through.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel hinges on the discovery of a real-life love story from the 1960s, played out through notes in the margins of classic novels. The present-day story explores the difference between making good choices and *having* good choices, and how books can connect people in meaningful ways.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really warmed up to the characters as the story progressed. I especially enjoyed the chapters told from the POV of Noodle, the (likely) neurodivergent youngest child in the family.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Literary References:**  \n  The novel moves between dual timelines (the 1960s and present day) and multiple points of view. There are tons of literary references to classic books, which can be a bit overwhelming if classics aren’t your thing. The book spells out the big parallels for you even if you haven’t read Brontë, but I probably need to brush up on my classics to catch all the symbolism.  \n\n- **Memorable Quotes:**  \n  One of my favorite lines: “In many ways, books were more alive than most of the people he knew. They were living, breathing entities that changed each time you picked them up.”  \n\n- **Suitability for Discussion:**  \n  This novel is more character-driven than plot-driven, and it’s a book that practically *begs* to be discussed. It would make an excellent book club pick, especially since it includes a fantastic discussion guide at the back of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started slow, it eventually drew me in with its dual timelines, rich character development, and exploration of meaningful themes. The literary references and symbolism add depth, though they might require some familiarity with classics.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  Gilmore has created a solid read with \"The Library of Borrowed Hearts,\" blending elements of found family, classic literature, and a touch of romance. The story follows Chloe, a twenty-something library worker juggling the responsibilities of being the sole caretaker for her three younger siblings. Her discovery of old correspondence in the margins of a library book leads her to uncover a secret romance, which becomes the centerpiece of the narrative. The plot thickens when Chloe's cranky neighbor, Jasper, offers $5,000 for the book, hinting at his connection to the mystery. With the help of Zach, a local wilderness trainer, Chloe works to unravel the decades-old secret.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel effectively explores themes of familial trauma and found family, which are woven throughout the story. These themes add depth to the characters and their relationships, making the narrative emotionally resonant.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Gilmore invests significant effort into developing the characters, particularly Chloe, Jasper, and Zach. Chloe's struggles and resilience make her a relatable protagonist, while Jasper's mysterious connection to the book adds intrigue. Zach's supportive and kind nature complements Chloe's journey, creating a well-rounded cast.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The novel concludes with an abrupt ending that feels uncharacteristic of the otherwise well-paced story. While not every novel requires an epilogue, the extensive character development and intricate plotlines suggest that a more conclusive resolution would have been fitting.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"The Library of Borrowed Hearts\" is a compelling read with a strong focus on found family, classic literature, and romance. Despite its abrupt ending, the novel excels in character development and thematic exploration, making it a worthwhile read for fans of heartfelt stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "I found it frustrating that Zach was revealed to be Jasper's long-lost grandchild without ever disclosing this to Chloe. Keeping such a significant secret from a loved one is deeply problematic. If the author intended for this plotline to work, the book needed much more development—perhaps an additional 500 pages—to allow Zach and Chloe to confront their trust issues, potentially through therapy. However, I loved the premise, which centers on Chloe, a struggling almost-librarian caring for her three siblings, and Zach, a rugged yet kind and supportive character. I appreciated the care Chloe showed for her family and for Jasper.",
            "I appreciated exploring Jasper's love story, but I found the twist involving Catherine to be quite disappointing. Her decision to fake her own death and run away with Jasper's unborn child felt more manipulative than romantic. Even if her intentions were good, after ten years, she could have reached out to Jasper to explain the situation. He deserved the opportunity to be a father."

It would have been more reasonable for her to facilitate a relationship between father and son. Her lack of remorse is difficult to accept, especially given the circumstances.",

While other narrators performed better, the overall narration quality was subpar and made it difficult to enjoy the audiobook.  \n\n- **Plot Engagement:**  \n  The plot was predictable and lacked the depth or excitement I’ve come to expect from this author. It didn’t hold my interest as much as their other works, making it a less enjoyable read overall.  \n\n- **Format Preference:**  \n  I believe I would have enjoyed the novel more if I had read the paper version instead of listening to the audiobook. The narration issues significantly impacted my experience, and I found myself struggling to finish the audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, the poor narration quality and predictable plot made it a less satisfying experience.

His backstory, revealing him as a young man who experienced love and heartbreak, added depth and emotional resonance to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing felt uneven—some parts of the book seemed rushed, while others included excessive detail that didn’t contribute to the story. This inconsistency detracted from the overall reading experience.  \n\n- **Literary References:**  \n  The book included numerous references to classic literature, many of which I hadn’t read or heard of. While this might appeal to avid readers of classic books, it made the story less accessible and enjoyable for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the concept of a love story told through annotated books was creative, the execution fell short due to uneven pacing, too many POVs, and an overreliance on obscure literary references. Jasper’s character was a highlight, but overall, the book was just okay for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The lack of foreshadowing and forced connections between characters and plot points detracted from the overall impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I felt less motivated to listen compared to reading.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot was very interesting, with a back-and-forth timeline that kept me intrigued. The inclusion of an old character we were already invested in added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The family dynamics were sweet and well-portrayed. However, there were a lot of characters to keep up with, which made it a bit challenging at times.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  I appreciated that the story didn’t tie everything up with a “perfect happy ending.” Instead, it felt more realistic and true to life.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had an engaging plot and strong character dynamics, though the large cast of characters and my shift to audiobook format slightly impacted my enjoyment. The realistic ending was a refreshing touch.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSomewhere between 3 and 4 out of 5."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  - I liked the found family themes in *The Lonely Hearts Book Club*, but the story missed the mark for me emotionally.  \n  - The book felt depressing, and I didn’t connect with most of the characters except for Chloe.  \n  - The story lacked heartwarming moments, and the emotional depth I expected wasn’t there.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  - The pacing was extremely slow, and not much actually happened in the story.  \n  - There were too many plotlines, and none of them felt fully developed or satisfying.  \n  - The mystery surrounding Jasper and Catherine wasn’t compelling, and Catherine’s character came across as selfish and unlikable.  \n\n- **Setting and Believability:**  \n  - The dual timelines (present day and the 1960s) didn’t work well together.  \n  - The 1960s storyline, particularly Jasper’s circumstances as a logger, felt unrealistic for the time period.  \n  - The modern-day storyline, especially the mother abandoning her children, felt underdeveloped and strange.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Chloe was the only character I cared about; the others felt flat or uninteresting.  \n  - The romance between Chloe and Zach, as well as the subplot involving Noodle, felt rushed and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - The audiobook had different narrators for various points of view, which was entertaining.  \n  - However, the frequent shifts in perspective made the story feel disjointed and less cohesive.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Lonely Hearts Book Club* had potential with its found family themes and dual timelines, it ultimately fell flat for me. The slow pacing, underdeveloped plotlines, and lack of emotional connection with the characters made it a disappointing read. The audiobook narration was enjoyable, but the fragmented storytelling didn’t help the overall experience. This book didn’t resonate with me, though I acknowledge that others might enjoy it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story suffers from excessive POV shifts, resulting in a disjointed and incoherent narrative. A more focused approach, using just two perspectives—Chloe and 1960/Catherine—would have enhanced its coherence and impact. The pacing is uneven, with a slow buildup that culminates in an anticlimactic resolution; the climax crests too early, leaving the story feeling flat. The mystery and overall storyline are disappointing, failing to deliver a satisfying payoff. Several plot points remain unresolved or poorly explained, such as Chloe's anger towards Zach, the family's decision to keep the dog despite their struggles, and the unnecessary emphasis on name-brand cereal. Additionally, the custody situation involving Chloe and the children feels unrealistic, particularly given the state of the house and the potential for CPS involvement.",
            "Chloe's character and her struggles felt underdeveloped. Although I could infer her emotions by reading between the lines, the frequent shifts in point of view left too much unexplored. Jasper's reclusive and unkind behavior, as well as his attachment to the frisbees, lacked sufficient explanation. Additionally, the depiction of women with bold, heartbreaker personalities seemed outdated and out of place in this narrative.",
            "The writing style was engaging and piqued my curiosity, but I was ultimately disappointed by the lack of depth and resolution. While the narration showed promise, it was undermined by structural and pacing issues."

            "The shifts between 1960 and the present day were occasionally jarring, disrupting my immersion in the story. The ending felt rushed and overly tidy, which undermined its believability. Catherine's abrupt decision to call off her wedding, coupled with the sudden revelation of her survival and secret child, lacked the depth and emotional resonance needed to make these twists impactful.",
            "Catherine and Jasper's character arcs felt incomplete and underdeveloped. While Chloe had some admirable traits, she often came across as unconvincing; her reluctance to show vulnerability made it difficult to connect with her. Additionally, the emotional responses and dialogue, particularly during pivotal moments like her mother's return, were lacking, leaving me confused.",
            "The sudden reappearance of Catherine and the absence of emotional fallout felt exaggerated and unrealistic. The characters' actions and reactions often lacked authenticity, making it difficult to fully engage with the story.",
            "The story overlooks significant opportunities to delve into deep-rooted pain and emotions, especially regarding Catherine’s presumed death and her choice to keep her child a secret for 60 years. The casual treatment of these pivotal events feels like a missed chance, depriving readers of the emotional depth and complexity the narrative deserves."

        "conclusion": "While the novel had potential with its bookish references and dual timelines, it fell short in execution. The underdeveloped characters, rushed ending, and lack of emotional depth left me disconnected and unsatisfied.

The main character doesn’t find the rare edition of the book at a flea market; she discovers it in her library workplace’s dingy basement while clearing it out.  \n\n- **Plot Convenience and Cliches:**  \n   - The book relies heavily on convenient plot points and cliches, which became tiresome. For example, the 1960s pregnancy subplot and Catherine’s decision to fake her death so Jasper could “move on” felt overly contrived and eye-roll-inducing.  \n\n- **Character Development (Catherine):**  \n   - Catherine’s character felt unrealistic and overly stereotypical, embodying the “manic pixie dream girl” trope, which made her hard to believe or connect with.  \n\n- **Predictability and Foreshadowing:**  \n   - The foreshadowing regarding Zach being a secret relative was heavy-handed, and the eventual reveal felt annoyingly predictable.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The multiple character points of view introduced towards the end slowed the story down and made it feel predictable and less engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some intriguing elements, it was ultimately weighed down by its reliance on cliches, predictable plot twists, and unrealistic characterizations.

            "The book suffers from a slow pace in terms of events while rushing through character development, leading to an inconsistent narrative. Key events are introduced casually, making it difficult to invest in them. The plot lacks originality, and Catherine's decisions, though portrayed as selfless, come off as selfish and illogical. Her return to town with a Birkin and a bad attitude feels unrealistic, especially given her supposed success. Additionally, the relationship between Chloe and Zach feels implausible, considering they met only a week ago, while the older characters who genuinely loved each other are denied a happy ending.",
            "The characters in the story are frustratingly one-dimensional, lacking depth and complexity. Their motivations often feel black and white, leading to actions that contradict their descriptions. Chloe, in particular, comes across as flat, with her personality revolving solely around her care for her siblings and financial struggles—neither of which is convincingly depicted. Additionally, the siblings' awareness of their financial situation is inconsistent, further contributing to the overall frustration.",
            "The book frequently reiterates the same themes: Chloe's selflessness, Catherine's alleged greatness, and Jasper's loneliness. This repetition becomes tedious and detracts from the overall narrative.",
            "The book struggles to establish an emotional connection with its characters. By the end, I found myself indifferent to their fates, as they felt underdeveloped and inconsistent. This lack of emotional depth and logical coherence left a disappointing impression."

They are portrayed as too black and white, and their actions often contradict their descriptions.\n   - Catherine’s parents are a prime example of this inconsistency. Initially described as a stern father and a quietly obliging mother, their dynamic is later reversed, which ruins the experience of understanding the characters.\n   - Chloe’s personality is one-dimensional, revolving solely around taking care of her siblings and financial struggles, which are not convincingly portrayed.\n   - The siblings’ awareness of their financial situation is inconsistent, adding to the frustration.\n\n- **Plot and Logic:**\n   - The story itself is not noteworthy. Catherine’s decisions are selfish, yet the author tries to paint them as selfless, which doesn’t make logical sense.\n   - The plot lacks realism, especially in Catherine’s return to town with a Birkin and a bad attitude, despite her supposed success.\n   - The relationship between Chloe and Zach feels unrealistic, given they met barely a week ago, while the older characters who supposedly loved each other don’t get a happy ending.\n\n- **Repetition and Redundancy:**\n   - The book repeatedly summarizes the same points: Chloe’s selflessness, Catherine’s supposed greatness, and Jasper’s loneliness. This repetition becomes tedious and adds little value to the narrative.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The book fails to create an emotional connection with the characters.
