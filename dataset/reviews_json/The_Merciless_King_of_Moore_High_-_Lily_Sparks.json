The plot is well-structured, linear, and coherent—complex yet intelligently crafted. The epilogue left me eager for a sequel! Initially, I found the love triangle between Kay, Leo, and Brick to be clichéd and tedious, with their interactions feeling overdone.

            "This story is a thrilling ride filled with twists, court intrigues, shadowy plots, and betrayals, ensuring there's never a dull moment. The pacing keeps readers anxious and engaged, with duels, alliances, and shocking revelations on nearly every page. Set in a high school where students barricade themselves against bloodthirsty monsters, it evokes *This Is Not a Test* by Courtney Summers, but instead of zombies, the threat is something far more mysterious and terrifying: the adults have transformed into monsters. The narrative unfolds primarily through Kay's perspective, interspersed with glimpses from other characters, enriching the experience. The contrast between Jefferson High's rational, democratic environment and Moore High's medieval, hierarchical structure adds depth to the world-building. The story concludes satisfyingly while leaving ample room for a sequel. The shocking epilogue raises new questions about the Growns (or dragons), leaving readers eager for more.",
            "Kay, the complex and traumatized protagonist, delivers a compelling narration. The character dynamics are intricate, filled with alliances, betrayals, and political intrigue. Initially skeptical of the love triangle trope, I found it refreshing that it never fully develops, overshadowed by the characters' feelings for others and the overarching political drama. Identifying a true villain is challenging, as each character believes they are acting in the best interest of their people, even if some actions appear villainous.",
            "The author boldly eliminates characters when it serves the narrative, and one particular death still resonates with me emotionally. Kay's skepticism about submitting to a teenage king is relatable, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear why the characters embrace their medieval lifestyle—it provides them with purpose and hope."

She gave me one of the most psychopathic and attractive bookish boyfriends ever (hi, Erik).  \n   - After a trilogy like *Teen Killers Club*, there was a risk that some characters might resemble others, but that’s not the case here. Kay is not Signal, King Max is not Erik, and none of the characters feel recycled.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story is set in a high school where kids barricade themselves to hide from bloodthirsty monsters, reminiscent of *This Is Not a Test* by Courtney Summers.

There’s never a dull moment.  \n   - The pacing keeps you anxious and engaged, with duels, alliances, and shocking revelations on almost every page.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - Lily Sparks isn’t afraid to kill off characters if it serves the story, and one particular death still makes me emotional.  \n   - The skepticism Kay feels about bowing to a teenage king is relatable, but as the story progresses, you understand why the characters have adopted their medieval lifestyle—it gives them purpose and hope.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**\n   - The story has a satisfying conclusion, but like *Teen Killers Club*, there’s plenty of room for a sequel.

            "The romance between Kay and Bricks, as well as Kay and Leo, failed to captivate me. While I used to enjoy love triangles in dystopian settings, I've encountered so many that they no longer pique my interest. However, Kay's perspective was refreshing; her chaotic nature kept me on edge and added depth to her character. The book is both intriguing and bizarre, reminiscent of *Hell Followed With Us* and *The Hunger Games*. It weaves together elements of intrigue, gore, political drama, teen romance, and numerous plot twists. I would have appreciated more details about the events leading to the apocalypse, but I understand why the protagonists might want to avoid reliving those moments.",
            "I was captivated by the psychology of the Moore High students. Unlike Jefferson students, who approach their situation literally, the Moore High kids employ a fantasy-like coping mechanism to navigate their challenges. At first, their terminology unsettled me, but as I grasped their ideology, I recognized its importance for their mental survival. The author skillfully portrayed this aspect."

The author handled this aspect exceptionally well.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - The romance between Kay and Bricks or Kay and Leo didn’t captivate me as much. While love triangles in dystopian settings used to appeal to me, I’ve read so many that they no longer hold my interest.  \n   - However, Kay’s perspective was refreshing. Her chaotic nature made me worry about her multiple times, adding depth to her character.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - Despite some minor critiques, the book was a good read. I found it engaging and would recommend it to fans of dystopian stories with psychological depth and unexpected twists.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a compelling blend of dystopian intrigue, psychological exploration, and dramatic twists. While the romance subplot didn’t stand out, the unique coping mechanisms of the Moore High kids and Kay’s chaotic perspective made the story memorable. Overall, it’s a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n👌🏻 (Positive recommendation, though no specific numerical rating is provided.)"

            "The story opens *in media res*, instantly drawing me into the action and intrigue. The pacing remains captivating throughout, maintaining interest even after the introduction of pivotal characters such as the cheerleaders, Brick, and King Max.",
            "The protagonist, Kay, is relatable and refreshingly vulnerable, lacking the typical plot armor that often shields characters in fiction, making her a compelling figure to root for. The supporting cast is equally well-developed, with villains who possess complexity rather than being comically evil, and heroes who are not entirely incorruptible, which adds depth and unpredictability to the narrative. Moments of grief, especially those experienced by Kay and Nirali, lend emotional weight to the story, though I found myself wishing for more of these poignant instances.",
            "The novel addresses weighty themes such as murder, starvation, familial loss, and suicidal ideation, which may be distressing for some readers. However, it balances these dark elements with a sense of fun and adventure, offering a refreshing take on the dystopian genre.",
            "This novel masterfully blends apocalyptic survival, rom-com, action/adventure, teen drama, politics, and body horror. The fantastical premise—where all adults transform into bloodthirsty monsters, leaving teenagers to navigate a high school setting—creates a unique backdrop. Despite its zany and improbable elements, the story skillfully balances its diverse genres and themes."

        "conclusion": "*The Merciless King of Moore High* is a masterfully crafted blend of genres, combining apocalyptic survival, teen drama, and dark humor into a compelling and unpredictable story. With relatable characters, emotional depth, and a fast-paced plot, it’s a refreshing take on the dystopian genre. While some themes may be heavy for certain readers, the novel’s balance of fun and heart makes it a standout. I highly recommend it and eagerly await more from the author.",

Set in a Connecticut town overrun by monsters, the story follows two rival groups of teenagers as they navigate a world where all adults have morphed into grotesque, bloodthirsty creatures.

The dynamics among the characters are intense, with their antics often mind-boggling. Yet, beneath their wild behavior lies a touching realism, revealing their deep longing for their parents and the lives they've left behind.",

            "The characters are well-crafted and avoid clichéd tropes. However, the story attempts to pack too much into a short time frame, which could have benefited from further expansion. The queer representation is notable, featuring a relationship between one of the pseudo-main characters and another woman. While this is central to the narrative, I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of this relationship.",
            "The world-building lacks depth, as the monsters are introduced with little explanation or intrigue. They serve primarily as a device to generate horror and isolate the characters rather than being fully integrated into the story.",

The monsters are introduced without much explanation, theorization, or interest, serving more as a mechanic to create horror and isolate the characters.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - The characters are well-done, with no overly clichéd tropes.

            "The story features some well-executed twists that kept me guessing until the very end. However, the abrupt conclusion was frustrating, leaving many questions unanswered—such as Brick’s future as Kyle, the state of Moore under Max and Merlin, and the mystery of Leo’s transformation. While this might be forgivable in a larger narrative, as a standalone, it felt incomplete.",
            "Kay and Brick's romance, while charming, occasionally veered into cliché territory. Their mutual obliviousness to each other's feelings was endearing. The late revelation that Brick and Max are half-brothers was intriguing but felt underdeveloped. Leo's murder served as a devastating moment, starkly contrasting the characters' expectations with the harsh realities of their world, emphasizing their youth and vulnerability despite their authority. However, the constant political maneuvering and the prevalence of self-serving characters became exhausting. Initially, I appreciated the complexity of their selfish agendas, but it soon grew tiresome to see so many characters wishing harm upon one another. Starr's observation about the lack of mutual support among them resonated deeply, highlighting my growing dislike for most characters. The dystopian setting effectively amplified humanity's worst traits, creating an uncomfortable yet thought-provoking atmosphere. Additionally, the repeated targeting of Kay by other characters felt redundant and frustrating.",
            "I wished for more flashbacks to the \"Before\" era to deepen the context and character development. The mention of other schools in Brockton, aside from Jefferson and Moore, was intriguing but not thoroughly explored. Starr's disinterest in returning to these schools made me eager for more insights into their societies.",
            "The premise of the story is incredibly creative, featuring a captivating dystopian world. The contrasting schools of Jefferson and Moore each have their own advantages and disadvantages. While Moore flourishes, it demands participation in Expansion—essentially hunting Growns and dragons—whereas Jefferson teeters on the edge of starvation. Neither choice is perfect, but survival hinges on accepting the shortcomings of each system."

Moore thrived but required participation in Expansion (killing Growns/dragons), while Jefferson was on the brink of starvation. Neither option was ideal, but survival depended on tolerating the flaws of each system.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships**  \n   - Kay and Brick’s romance was adorable, even if it was cliché at times. Their mutual obliviousness to each other’s feelings was endearing.  \n   - The revelation that Brick and Max are half-brothers was interesting but felt underdeveloped due to its placement at the end of the book.  \n   - Leo’s murder was a devastating moment that highlighted the disconnect between the characters’ expectations and the brutal reality of their world. It underscored that despite their authority, they were still kids or barely adults, which added emotional depth.\n\n- **Plot Twists and Pacing**  \n   - Some twists were well-executed and kept me guessing until the very end.  \n   - The lack of a definitive ending was frustrating. The book stops abruptly after the epilogue, leaving many questions unanswered (e.g., Brick’s future as Kyle, the state of Moore with Max and Merlin in power, and the mystery of Leo’s transformation). If this is part of a series, it might be forgivable, but as a standalone, it felt incomplete.\n\n- **Character Morality and Politics**  \n   - The constant political maneuvering and lack of altruistic characters became exhausting. While I initially appreciated the complexity of everyone having selfish agendas, it grew tiresome to see so many characters wanting others dead.  \n   - Starr’s observation about the lack of mutual support among the characters resonated deeply and made me realize how much I disliked most of them. The dystopian setting amplified humanity’s worst traits, which was uncomfortable but thought-provoking.  \n   - The repeated targeting of Kay by other characters felt repetitive and annoying.\n\n- **World-Building and Backstory**  \n   - I would have loved more flashbacks about “Before” to provide context and depth to the characters and their world.  \n   - The existence of other schools in Brockton (beyond Jefferson and Moore) was intriguing but underexplored. Starr’s disinterest in returning to them left me craving more details about their societies.\n\n- **Nitpicks and Minor Details**  \n   - A positive nitpick: Frank the dog survived, which was a relief given the lack of animal cruelty in the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a wild ride with a highly creative premise and some well-executed twists. However, the exhausting political dynamics, underdeveloped backstory, and lack of a satisfying ending left me feeling conflicted. While I appreciated the emotional depth of certain moments and the adorable romance between Kay and Brick, the overall experience was a mix of fascination and frustration.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars. If more books are planned, I might revisit and adjust this rating, but as it stands, this was an interesting yet uneven read."

The story thrusts readers into the action right from the start. Initially confusing, the narrative quickly becomes engaging. The two high schools, Jefferson and Moore, showcase contrasting systems: Jefferson is governed by a dysfunctional student council, while Moore resembles a medieval video game, complete with a king and dragon-slaying quests. This juxtaposition is captivating—Jefferson appears organized but falters, whereas Moore thrives despite its chaos. The political dynamics within the schools and a love triangle enrich the plot. Additionally, the phrase \"From the dam to the beach, Brockton will be free,\" which hints at support for Palestine, is thought-provoking yet raises concerns about sensitivity in its application."

            "Set in a world where adults have transformed into giant monsters, wreaking havoc and destruction, the story follows high schoolers who have fortified their schools to survive. The protagonist, Kay, uncovers a dark secret about her starving enclave and is sentenced to death by exile. She is rescued by scavengers from Moore High, a school governed by a 'King' who has structured their society around a computer game. Unlike her previous school, Moore High is thriving, and its students are ready to confront the monstrous 'growns.' As Kay navigates shifting alliances, she must contend with both external dangers and internal conflicts. The narrative wisely avoids delving into the reasons behind the adults' mutation or the formation of the monster conglomerations, maintaining a brisk and engaging pace throughout.",

It features all the classic elements: a collapsed society, resourceful teens battling for survival, unconventional romances, and ample bloodshed. I can't help but think it would have been a major hit two decades ago."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Nostalgia:**  \n  - It has been a while since I've read a YA dystopian novel, and this was a lovely return to the genre that was so popular at the turn of the century.  \n  - The story includes all the hallmarks of the genre: a collapsed society, teens fighting to survive, offbeat romances, and plenty of blood and guts.  \n  - I can't help but feel this would have been a big hit 20 years ago.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The story is set in a world where adults suddenly mutated into giant monsters, killing everything in sight. High schoolers survived by turning their schools into fortresses.  \n  - The protagonist, Kay, discovers a secret about her starving school enclave and is sentenced to death by exile. She is picked up by scavengers from Moore High, a school run by a 'King' who modeled their society after a computer game.  \n  - Unlike her previous school, Moore High is not on the brink of starvation, and its students are willing to fight the 'growns' (monsters). Kay must navigate alliances to survive both the external and internal threats.  \n\n- **Characters and Perspectives:**  \n  - The story is primarily told through the perspectives of Kay and Brick, Moore High's 'enforcer.' There are a few other POVs, including a student council leader from Jefferson High, but the focus remains on Kay and Brick.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - The action is fun and intense, making the book highly engrossing.  \n  - The story doesn't dwell on explaining why the adults mutated or how the monster conglomerations formed, which keeps the pacing brisk and engaging.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  - The world-building on a grand scale isn't deeply explored, but the smaller-scale world-building within the two high school enclaves is well-crafted and enjoyable.  \n  - The 'societies' at Jefferson High and Moore High are intriguing and add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  - This book is a good, fun read, especially for those who have been missing a post-apocalyptic YA romp.  \n  - The merciless King of Moore High is one of the better reads this year.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA dystopian novel delivers an engaging and action-packed story with well-crafted smaller-scale world-building and intriguing character dynamics. While it doesn't delve deeply into the broader world's mysteries, it offers a fun and nostalgic return to the genre, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

            "The book concludes abruptly, with an epilogue that introduces a new twist but leaves many threads unresolved. If it stands alone, this lack of closure can feel unsatisfying. However, the open-ended nature of the story may resonate with some readers, capturing the unpredictability of real life.",
            "The teenage characters' irrational decisions are understandable given their developmental stage, but their persistent self-sabotage and conflict with others can be frustrating. On the positive side, the shifting points of view added depth to the story, especially since Kay's perspective became increasingly irritating over time.",
            "The book's premise is captivating: adults transform into monsters, leaving only children and teenagers to survive. The mystery surrounding the cause of the transformation and the uncertain fate of the teenagers as they mature adds a compelling layer of realism. The world-building unfolds alongside the characters, with events having occurred less than a year prior, making the discovery process both engaging and immersive.",
            "The book was marketed with ties to King Arthur’s court, which shaped initial expectations. However, it is not a retelling of that legend, featuring only the character name Merlin. This disconnect may impact the reader’s experience. Nonetheless, the book is ideal for fans of post-apocalyptic settings and teen drama. The combination of survival challenges and personal conflicts creates a captivating narrative for genre enthusiasts."

Although the plot twist at the end isn't my favorite trope, it is exhilarating and will appeal to fans of CW-style drama.",
            "This book presents a gripping narrative through the perspectives of three well-developed characters: Kay, Nirali, and Brick. Kay faces exile for revealing a secret she couldn't conceal, Nirali embodies the hope for her school, and Brick maneuvers the complex power dynamics between his best friend, King Max, and Kay. The interactions among the characters, particularly the court intrigue involving King Max, Merlin, and Brick, are particularly compelling, enhancing the story's depth.",

Key questions about the fate of the children and the origins of resources like gas and car parts remain unanswered. While the novel presents a unique and engaging premise—offering a fresh take on the post-apocalyptic genre with strong Lord of the Flies vibes—it starts strong but becomes convoluted towards the end.

The horror/apocalypse/event isn’t explored in great depth, as the real terror lies in the dystopian setup created by teenagers in its aftermath. At times, it feels more like political intrigue or a murder mystery, but then a giant monster appears to remind you of the larger stakes. I was constantly unsure of who to trust or who was “right” or “wrong,” which made the story absolutely fascinating. It was a really enjoyably weird read.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The book is hyper-focused on a very small portion of the world and never zooms out to provide a broader perspective. The main characters don’t know what happened to the rest of the world (or even beyond their high school), so neither does the reader. Similarly, they don’t understand what creates or motivates the Growns, so that mystery remains unresolved. While I wished for more information about the Growns, I also appreciated that the story drops you into the middle of the action without excessive exposition or info-dumping.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Most of the characters were intentionally unlikable and utterly untrustworthy, which kept me guessing throughout. I really liked Kay, even when I wanted to shout at her to stop talking. Brick was probably my second favorite, despite his flawed decisions. I wish we had learned more about Starr, but the book did an excellent job of keeping so many distinct POVs engaging and interesting.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The story is packed with twists and turns, yet everything makes sense in a general way. Some revelations were shocking, but they felt logical in hindsight. If this book doesn’t have a sequel, I think the ending would be disappointing (not a true cliffhanger, but a lot is left unresolved). However, if there is a sequel, I’ll happily read it.  \n\n- **Pacing/Prose:**  \n  The pacing is fast throughout, with constant action driving the story forward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an utterly captivating and weirdly enjoyable read. The dystopian setup, untrustworthy characters, and constant twists kept me hooked.

However, it effectively sets up the domino effect that drives the latter half of the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending is open-ended, darkly funny, and carries a sacrificial tone that aligns with the themes of the story. However, its short-sightedness may leave some readers wanting more closure.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  The novel falls short compared to other YA and non-YA books with similar themes and settings. The best works in this genre offer a unique angle or compelling characters, which I felt were lacking here.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Merciless King of Moore High* has an intriguing premise and explores thought-provoking themes, it struggles to fully engage due to its unremarkable political intrigue, uneven pacing, and underdeveloped protagonist. The secondary characters and action sequences are highlights, but the story ultimately doesn’t stand out among similar works in the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5⭐️"

            "The plot is a notable strength, effectively examining human nature within a post-apocalyptic landscape. The teenagers' behavior and interactions are largely believable, although their knowledge in specific areas, such as medical settings, occasionally feels exaggerated. The narrative tends to feel disjointed, particularly in the first half, where it jumps abruptly between scenes. It often seems as though the author has a checklist of events for each chapter, leading to transitions that lack context and fluidity, resulting in a rushed pacing.",

Secondary characters appeared early on but vanished for much of the central narrative. Main characters like Max, Brick, and Jess would have benefited from deeper backstories to enhance the impact of their revelations and plot developments.",

What about being true to your friends? Keeping your word? There’s nothing else now, do you get that?” underscores the importance of loyalty and the significance of their relationships. He emphasizes that the people around them are all they will have for the rest of their lives—“All we are is what we mean to our friends.” The ending is poignant as Brick reflects, “When we part, she’s completely smiling, like she’s learned my secret. That my heart is her dog, that she makes it come running. That it’s been hers, for a long time.” This beautifully encapsulates the intimacy they share.",

The reading experience feels like a mix of post-apocalyptic, court politics, survival horror, dark comedy, and forbidden romance.  \n  - The Arthurian influences were confusing. Names like Kay and Merlin were used, but the themes weren’t consistent, and no other Arthurian elements were present.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The book starts in the middle of the action, which is engaging and easy to follow despite the complexity.

Whose choices were justifiable? While we’re supposed to root for Kay, I found myself understanding the decisions of other characters, even when they were morally questionable or outright horrible.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplots:**  \n  - The love triangle, which expanded into a more complex web of relationships (including marriage plots and past connections), wasn’t very convincing.  \n  - The book is categorized as queer, but there’s only one queer ship tease, which feels insufficient to justify the label.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  - The book is a unique blend of genres and tones, making it hard to categorize but also creating a memorable reading experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a challenging yet compelling read, blending multiple genres and tones into a story that’s hard to define.
