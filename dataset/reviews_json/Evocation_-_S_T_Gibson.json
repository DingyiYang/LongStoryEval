It was my favorite relationship in the book.\n   - Every gesture of love between them, whether it was David kissing Moira's hand or Moira embracing him, filled my heart with joy.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The plot itself was very engaging and interesting. It was a book I constantly wanted to return to and read.\n   - I'm glad there's a second book in the series because I don't want this to be the end of their story. However, I'm also happy that it concluded at a point where I'm not worried about their future.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a delightful read, with beautifully written relationships and well-developed characters. The balance and harmony among the three main characters were particularly striking, and the emotional depth of their connections was heartwarming. The plot kept me engaged, and I'm excited to continue the journey in the next book.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The three main characters—Rhys, Moira, and David—possess distinct forms of magic that enrich their individual characterizations. The dynamic between the husband, his ex-boyfriend, and his wife could have been disordered, but I appreciated the thoughtful handling of their relationships. This was my first encounter with poly representation, and I found the romance and its development captivating. \n\nMy favorite aspect of the novel was the platonic love between David and Moira. Their complicated history added depth to their evolving relationship, illustrating that love doesn’t have to be sexual or romantic to be meaningful. Their commitment to improving communication only strengthened their bond. Moira and David’s connection felt more compelling than any other configuration among the trio, and I’m eager to see how their dynamic unfolds in future installments.",

I was particularly captivated by the exploration of a Boston-based secret society of occultists and enjoyed discovering the various magical practitioners, including witches, mediums, and sorcerers. The lore and history of the world were compelling, especially the intriguing backstory of David’s Russian grandfathers and the family curse that haunts them. I eagerly anticipate how this storyline will unfold, especially after the actions of a certain High Priest."

The combination of a sassy attitude tone and a deep, growly voice (reminiscent of Christian Bale’s Batman) made it tough to listen to for extended periods. However, his voice for David was excellent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a highly enjoyable read with immaculate vibes, strong character development, and intriguing plot threads.

I'm so glad that I read this because I truly enjoyed it.\n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**\n   - This book is very much a character study, so if you don't like the characters, you probably won't enjoy this book. I really liked the characters and connected with them.\n\n- **Plot and Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - The book explores what happens when you had an extremely toxic relationship with someone in your youth (Rhys and David) but have matured and still have to interact with one another (in their magical society) at least on a professional basis. \n   - One of you (Rhys) has gotten married (to Moira) and is working on strengthening that relationship, which has been rocky. \n   - Then something really bad (intentionally vague to avoid spoilers) is happening to David, and he needs the help of Rhys and Moira to figure it out. \n   - Rhys and David feel drawn to each other again, and Moira and David develop their own friendship. \n   - The central question is whether they can move past their toxic history and develop a new relationship moving forward.\n\n- **Resolution and Satisfaction:**\n   - There was one path they could have taken to solve David's problem, and I was worried that if the author chose that path, I would be absolutely out and might not read more by the author. (It felt like both too easy of a path and something that wouldn't have fit the character dynamics.) \n   - Fortunately, there wasn't even a hint that the characters/book were going down that path. Instead, I was quite satisfied by the ending.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I truly enjoyed this book. It was a compelling character study with well-developed relationships and a satisfying resolution that avoided an overly simplistic or out-of-character solution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n4.5 stars"

I was captivated by the connections between Moira and Rhys, Moira and David, and David and Rhys. The author skillfully crafted each relationship to be distinct, meaningful, and slightly toxic, while also valuing each character as an individual and each dynamic as significant. I also appreciated the well-developed side characters and the fact that the main characters had interesting friends—a rarity I always cherish.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Impressions and Context:**\n   - I initially read the beginning of Gibson's *A Dowry of Blood* a few years ago but never got past the first 10% because it didn’t hook me. I ended up forgetting about it until I stumbled upon an event for Gibson and Susan Dennard while looking for something to attend for the Read Harder challenge. The covers of their books intrigued me, as they both write gothic urban fantasies, which is exactly my kind of genre.\n\n- **Event Experience and Book Acquisition:**\n   - I attended the event with less than an hour’s notice and ended up trading the value of my ticket for a copy of *Evocation*. It wasn’t until halfway through the event that I realized Gibson also wrote *A Dowry of Blood*, but by then, it was too late to back out. This turned out to be a stroke of luck because I might not have attended otherwise.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**\n   - Despite receiving a nice release-day hardcover, I read *Evocation* on my Kindle, which was practical given its weight. It became my back-up plane book, and I was so engrossed that I couldn’t stop reading even after the flight. I was immediately invested in the lives of David, Rhys, and Moira.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - I loved the Boston setting and the occult world the characters inhabit. The Secret Society (a somewhat secretive Gentleman’s Club) and David’s childhood home delivered plenty of dark academia vibes, which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**\n   - The relationships in the book were a highlight for me. I’m drawn to weird, toxic relationships in fiction, and *Evocation* delivered this in abundance. I was obsessed with Moira and Rhys’ relationship, Moira and David’s relationship, and David and Rhys’ relationship. Gibson did an excellent job of making each relationship distinct, meaningful, and a little toxic, while valuing each character as an individual and each dynamic as important.\n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**\n   - While I found the resolution of the demon plotline slightly cheap (it reminded me of *The Rise of Skywalker*), I’m excited to see how this plot develops in the next book. Ultimately, *Evocation* is a character-driven novel, and it delivered everything it needed to in that regard.\n\n- **Side Characters and Overall Appeal:**\n   - I loved the side characters and appreciated that the main characters had interesting friends—a rarity that I’m always thankful for. If the description “weird urban fantasy occultism secret society polyamory” appeals to you, then this book is a must-read. I’m deeply invested in everyone involved and might even give *A Dowry of Blood* another try while waiting for the next book in this series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evocation* is a captivating, character-driven gothic urban fantasy with a richly built occult world and complex, toxic relationships that kept me hooked from start to finish. While the plot resolution felt a bit rushed, the novel excels in its character dynamics and setting, leaving me eager for the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The atmosphere was perfectly crafted, and David’s character had me laughing out loud while simultaneously sparking curiosity about the person beneath his exterior."

I particularly enjoyed the mystery of the Aristarkhov mansion, especially the scenes set in the library. I look forward to exploring the antagonist's motivations in future installments.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the three main characters: David, Rhys, and Moira. The author has surprisingly softened my intense dislike for the name David. Rhys, a beautifully crafted disaster bisexual, adds depth to the story. Moira, my favorite, embodies goodness and charity; she is a strong, well-defined woman who consistently makes her own choices and reaps positive rewards. The romance between Moira and Rhys is enchanting, characterized by a genuine and effortless love. The complex feelings between Rhys and David enrich the narrative, while the platonic, supportive bond between David and Moira offers a rare and uplifting portrayal. This story presents a positive view of open marriage, though it diverges from the \"why choose\" trope, as the romance hinges on making significant choices.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Impressions and Expectations:**\n   - I was immediately drawn in by the cover and the description, which gave me major John Constantine (of DC's Hellblazer) vibes.\n   - The description of a Boston filled with secret mediums, psychics, and occult societies set the stage perfectly for this story.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The underlying dread following David's declining health was compelling, and I was truly worried about his livelihood.\n   - I enjoyed the mystery hunt through the Aristarkhov mansion, especially the library scenes.\n   - I hope to see more of the antagonist and learn more about their motivations in the sequels.\n\n- **Writing:**\n   - The writing is fantastic; I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than 24 hours.\n   - The writing flows smoothly, with a unique tone and execution that isn't flowery or purple like Gibson's previous work.\n   - Each character has a distinct voice in their POVs, feeling fleshed out and three-dimensional.\n   - The magic system, while soft, is well-explored and explained when necessary.\n   - The descriptions of the world, both above and below Boston, are truly magical.\n\n- **Characters:**\n   - I loved all three main characters: David, Rhys, and Moira.\n   - Gibson might have cured some of my intense hatred towards the name David.\n   - Rhys is a major disaster bisexual, perfectly written in my opinion.\n   - Moira is my favorite; she shines as a pinnacle of goodness and charity, a strong, well-defined woman who consistently makes her own choices and is rewarded with positive outcomes.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - The romance is fantastic, with an utterly enchanting, easy, and genuine love between spouses Moira and Rhys.\n   - The tattered and frayed feelings between Rhys and David add depth.\n   - The platonic, supportive love between David and Moira is a rare and positive depiction.\n   - This is a very positive depiction of open marriage, though it doesn't fit the \"why choose\" trope, as the romance relies on making important choices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a truly fantastic start to a series, and I'm eagerly anticipating at least two more books. Gibson's writing is exceptional, with a modern, witty charm that differs from her previous works. The plot is compelling, the characters are well-developed, and the romance is beautifully portrayed. I highly recommend this book and believe it will be a huge hit in the fantasy section.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Rating: 5/5"

The straightforward plot lacks a real mystery, emphasizing that this is a character-driven narrative. However, I do wish the characters had been more developed, considering their centrality to the story. Nonetheless, I remain hopeful for future installments.",
            "While I may be biased due to my fondness for sad, flawed male characters, I truly enjoyed the cast in this book. Although some reviews claim the characters are shallow, I found myself too engrossed in the angsty fantasy and polyamory to mind. While I craved more depth, each character had moments where their personalities shone through. I was drawn to David from the start—he embodies the classic \"dickhead with a vulnerable side,\" and I couldn't help but get hooked. I was also pleasantly surprised by Moira, and her evolving queerplatonic relationship with David was a standout aspect of the story. The dynamic among the three main characters was simply perfect. Additionally, the cover is stunning; the silver gilding is exquisite, making it one of my favorite recent finds. The angsty tone and emotional depth of the relationships kept me thoroughly invested.",

            "My main critique is that the plot felt somewhat weak. While it was generally engaging, I would have liked to see more scenes of the characters actively working to break the curse, along with additional rituals and summonings.",
            "The relationship between Moira and Rhys was a highlight of the story, characterized by genuine love, trust, and healthy boundaries. It stands out as one of the most positive portrayals of a relationship I've encountered recently. Moreover, the book's exploration of love independent of sexual desire offers a vital and often overlooked message that I truly appreciated. \n\nThe characters were remarkable and well-developed, each with distinct personalities and goals. Even the supporting cast felt three-dimensional, showcasing the author's dedication to fleshing them out. The dynamic between David, Rhys, and Moira was particularly intriguing, and I enjoyed watching it evolve throughout the narrative. I'm eager to see how their relationships progress.",
            "The ambiance was extraordinary—mysterious, gothic, and dark, yet occasionally humorous. The inclusion of occult elements like secret societies, demon summoning, and tarot readings enriched the narrative.

I haven’t been this excited about reading a book in a while, and I was so immersed in the story that it truly didn’t even feel like I was reading.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters were all incredible, and I loved them so much. They each had their own personalities, goals, and were very well-rounded. Even the supporting characters felt three-dimensional, and it was clear that the author put effort into developing all of them. The dynamic between David, Rhys, and Moira was intriguing to follow, and I loved seeing it evolve from beginning to end. I’m curious to see where it goes as the series progresses.  \n\n- **Relationships and Representation:**  \n  The relationship between Moira and Rhys was refreshing to read about because it was filled with genuine love, trust, and boundaries. It’s one of the healthiest relationships I’ve encountered in recent reads. Additionally, the book’s exploration of love without the necessity of sexual desire was an important and rarely represented message that made me very happy.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Themes:**  \n  The vibes were immaculate—slightly spooky, gothic, and dark, yet still funny at times. The occult elements, such as secret societies, demon summonings, and tarot readings, added depth to the story. The nicknames, like “Little Goddess” and “Indigo Child,” were also a delightful touch.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  My only critique is that I found the plot to be a bit weak. While generally interesting, I wish there had been more scenes of the characters actively trying to break the curse, as well as more rituals and summonings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the minor critique about the plot, this book deserves nothing less than five stars for its engaging storytelling, well-developed characters, and unique representation of relationships.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - The characters, Rhys, David, and Moira, are well-developed with their own careers, lives, ambitions, histories, and values, making them feel like real people.\n   - The relationships, though slightly less toxic compared to previous works by ST Gibson, still feature flawed and somewhat problematic characters, which adds depth and realism.\n   - Moira’s empathy towards Rhys’ emotional needs and David’s spiritual trauma, combined with her firm boundaries and honest communication, makes her a standout character.\n\n- **Narrative and Prose:**\n   - The narrative masterfully blends flawed characters into a healthy and balanced story, emphasizing the importance of tenderness (both platonic and romantic) and empathy in challenging situations.\n   - The prose is gorgeous, maintaining ST Gibson’s distinctive voice while being faster and snappier than in previous works like *Dowry* and *AEIM*.\n   - The pacing and character-driven plot are well-crafted, making the book a showstopper and leaving the reader eager for the next installment.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**\n   - The novel explores themes of tenderness, empathy, and the complexities of human relationships, even in less-than-ideal circumstances.\n   - The emotional depth of the characters, particularly Moira’s empathy and boundaries, adds a layer of richness to the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**\n   - The book is a 5-star (or even 6-star) read, showcasing ST Gibson’s talent for creating compelling, flawed characters and engaging narratives.\n   - The reader is excited for Moira’s book and the progression of the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evocation* by ST Gibson is a beautifully crafted novel that balances flawed, realistic characters with a healthy and empathetic narrative. The prose is stunning, the pacing is excellent, and the emotional depth of the story is compelling. Moira, in particular, shines as a character, and the anticipation for her book and the series’ continuation is high. This is another standout work from ST Gibson, deserving of its high praise.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 5 stars (or 6 stars, as the reader humorously suggests)."

            "This novel features three captivating point-of-view characters, all of whom I adored. Two are mediums/witches—one specializing in divination and the other conducting séances—while the third is a Catholic sorcerer from Boston, entangled in secret societies and magic. The cast is refreshingly diverse, showcasing a range of queer identities, including a trans man, a trans woman, and polyamorous characters, alongside Chinese side characters. I appreciated that Moira retains her name after marriage. The plus-sized Black female main character and the gay/bisexual male main characters add significant depth and representation. Rhys, an emo character, shares a psychic bond that deepens over time, highlighting the complexities of queer and polyamorous relationships. David's unique connections with each character enhance the emotional richness of the story. The evolving psychic bond between Rhys and the others is beautifully portrayed, while the exploration of relationship issues adds realism and complexity to the narrative.",
            "The story unfolds in a haunted house, blending ghosts, demons, exorcisms, and secret societies tied to academia. The incorporation of astrology feels organic, particularly with a character who practices divination. The world is richly immersive, leaving me eager to delve deeper, especially into the sister's narrative involving chaos magic."

The narrative shifts between the perspectives of David, Rhys, and Moira, each with unique thoughts, mannerisms, and backgrounds. This structure keeps the story dynamic and clear. At its core, the tale follows David, a lawyer and spirit medium, who becomes entangled in a deal with the devil due to an ancestral agreement. As his life spirals out of control, he seeks help from his ex, Rhys, and the tarot-reader Moira. This modern paranormal fantasy emphasizes the occult and academia, blending urban fantasy with a polyamorous romance subplot.",

The world-building is thorough, requiring about 50 pages to fully immerse the reader, but it pays off as the plot gains momentum.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The story takes some time to establish the characters and the world, which may feel slow initially. However, once the groundwork is laid, the plot accelerates, making for an engaging and enjoyable read.\n   - The narrative alternates between the perspectives of David, Rhys, and Moira, each with distinct thoughts, mannerisms, and histories. This structure keeps the story dynamic and prevents confusion about whose perspective is being followed.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**\n   - The book explores themes of legacy, rivalry, and the complexities of relationships within a paranormal setting. The tone is a mix of dark fantasy and urban fantasy, with a focus on the occult rather than romance.\n   - The inclusion of a poly romance adds depth to the characters but is not the central focus of the plot.\n\n- **Comparisons and Expectations:**\n   - Fans of \"Ninth House\" who wished for more focus on the occult and less on university antics will likely enjoy this book.\n   - Readers expecting a romance-heavy narrative similar to \"A Dowry of Blood\" may be disappointed, as the romance here is secondary to the main plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis modern paranormal fantasy offers a rich blend of occult intrigue, academic rivalry, and complex character dynamics. While the initial setup may feel slow, the story quickly gains momentum, delivering an engaging and immersive experience. The diverse and messy cast, along with the detailed world-building, makes this a standout read for fans of urban fantasy with a queer twist.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

The tumultuous history between Rhys and David is captivating, while Moira stands out as an incredible character—her presence alone would enrich the world. At its core, the book explores how David, Rhys, and Moira navigate their evolving dynamics. The slow-burn, will-they-won’t-they poly romance is beautifully crafted, with their genuine compersion triumphing over jealousy and fear of the unknown. I appreciated Moira's proactive approach, as she buys a book on polyamory and clearly articulates her terms. David's non-sexual yet deeply intimate love for Moira, along with his journey to recognize his flaws and unlearn generational trauma, adds depth to the narrative.

That woman is my home, and I am more than willing to prioritize her—vehemently, if need be. If she tells me she needs something to feel safe, she gets it.

The representation and romantic elements added depth and kept me engaged. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "David begins as a rigid, self-important character, molded by his privileged upbringing and early success as a lawyer at 29. Initially, I found him unsympathetic and questioned Rhys's attraction to him. In contrast, Rhys, with his humble origins, and Moira, who radiates Southern charm and possesses a talent for Tarot and astrology, are instantly likable. However, as the story unfolds and we learn more about David's family and background, he becomes more relatable, evoking a sense of sympathy for his character.",
            "The novel immerses readers in a vibrant world of magic, featuring the Society and diverse magical practices. The curse and its evasion by David's ancestors add intriguing depth to the plot. I especially appreciated the background characters and their relationships, which enhance the overall narrative."

        "conclusion": "The first installment effectively sets the stage for an engaging narrative, blending a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and a richly imagined magical world. While David's initial demeanor was off-putting, his character growth and the dynamic between the trio kept me invested. The groundwork laid in this book promises exciting developments in future novels.",

            "The story centers on David Aristarkhov, a former teenage psychic prodigy turned Boston attorney and secret medium. His life takes a dramatic turn when the Devil invokes an ancestral pact, predicting his imminent demise. In desperation, David turns to his ex-lover Rhys, leading to a complex emotional journey involving Rhys and his wife, Moira, as they confront their intertwined fates. The premise is compelling, skillfully blending occult themes with personal stakes, and kept me captivated from the start.",
            "The characters are intricately entwined in a complex web of family curses and secret society rivalries. Rhys particularly resonated with me, standing out as a compelling figure. The relationships, especially the poly queer throuple dynamic between David, Rhys, and Moira, felt deeply personal and authentic. Their emotional struggles drew me further into their world. The book excels in diverse representation, showcasing a poly queer throuple and trans characters, which adds refreshing layers to the story and enhances its relatability.",

The rich setting, filled with tarot cards, magic, and astrology, adds depth and intrigue to the narrative. Although I would have appreciated a stronger emphasis on the academic elements, the expertly crafted occult aspects more than compensated for this shift in focus.",

However, the narrative flows smoothly between them without unnecessary backtracking, making each character engaging to read. My main disappointment was that the central theme of the deal with the devil felt underexplored, with the romance taking precedence.

I don’t usually like this style, but the story keeps moving fluidly through the characters rather than backtracking to catch everyone up. No single character feels like a slog to read through.  \n\n- **Plot Focus and Development:**  \n   - One thing that disappointed me was that the main issue of the deal with the devil feels very brushed over, and the romance takes the forefront. I enjoyed the romance, but I would have felt the story was more polished if there was more context, details, and research by the characters on the deal and its history instead of \"they spent all day looking through texts and came up empty.\" Hopefully, this will be fleshed out in subsequent books.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - The romance takes the reins over the plot in this one. I was kind of expecting a threesome situation from how much sexual tension there seemed to be between everyone, but the spicy scenes were just between 2 characters at a time.  \n\n- **World-Building and Descriptions:**  \n   - The descriptions of the places the characters visited and the characters themselves were vivid, which helped me immerse myself in their world.  \n\n- **Aesthetic and Presentation:**  \n   - The standard hardback cover of the book is gorgeous!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, it was a fun read.

        "review": [
            "I was captivated by the character dynamics, particularly among David, a gay psychic haunted by an ancestral demonic pact; Rhys, his ex and a bisexual sorcerer; and Moira, Rhys' diviner wife and the resident sweetheart. The tension and growth among the trio were messy yet deeply engaging, and I enjoyed witnessing their evolution together. David's fear of vulnerability resonated with me, and Moira's ability to draw him and Rhys into emotional openness was beautifully executed. While the polyamorous relationship among the men and Moira was intriguing, I found myself most invested in the bond between David and Moira. His realization that he could love deeply without sexual desire was profoundly significant, and their non-sexual love was portrayed with grace. Their relationship blossomed from a tentative connection into a powerful yet subtle intimacy, a quality often lacking in romantic fiction.",

        "conclusion": "This novel is a character-driven masterpiece that captivated me from start to finish. While the magical realism elements were lighter than I typically prefer, the rich character dynamics, particularly the relationship between David and Moira, more than made up for it. The portrayal of non-sexual love and emotional growth was beautifully written, and Moira’s character was a standout for her ability to inspire and uplift those around her. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and its exploration of love, vulnerability, and personal evolution.",

She had a way of inspiring others to be their best selves simply by being her own best self and expecting the same from those around her.  \n   - Her ability to bring out the best in David and Rhys made her shine brightly, and I absolutely loved her character.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The writing was marvelous, particularly in how it handled the emotional depth and complexity of the characters.  \n   - The exploration of vulnerability, love, and personal growth was executed with subtlety and power, making the story deeply resonant.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a character-driven masterpiece that captivated me from start to finish.

Although the curse serves as the plot's central conflict, the author devotes considerable attention to David's relationship with his ex-best friend.

It didn’t detract from the experience, but it wasn’t the driving force behind my enjoyment of the novel.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s ability to craft characters with such depth and emotional resonance is a testament to their skill. The writing style, particularly in how it portrays character dynamics, was a highlight.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite being in a reading slump for months, the novel’s strong character development and emotional depth kept me engaged. While the plot didn’t leave a lasting impression, the way the characters were written made the book a memorable and enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated David's journey of self-discovery and his willingness to embrace love throughout the story. The evolving dynamic between David and Rhys, along with their efforts to include Rhys' wife, Moira, was captivating. However, while Moira exemplified a positive portrayal of polyamory, I found her character somewhat immature and struggled to connect with her. At times, she even annoyed me. I wished she had more depth, akin to a character like Lilian De Paul.",

The story centers on David, a wealthy and arrogant man who has loved Rhys since college. Now at 30, he faces a family curse that is slowly killing him, and he believes Rhys is his only hope for salvation."

It felt like the book was written specifically for me, with all the tropes and characters that resonated deeply.  \n   - The story follows David, a high-powered, arrogant, and wealthy man who has been in love with Rhys since college. Now, at 30, he’s grappling with a family curse that’s slowly killing him, and Rhys is the only one he believes can help.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I loved how David mellowed and opened himself up to being loved throughout the story.  \n   - The evolving relationship between David and Rhys, as well as their attempt to build a relationship that includes Rhys’ wife, Moira, was compelling.  \n   - Moira, while a wonderful representation of polyamory working well, felt very young to me. I couldn’t fully connect with her character, and she annoyed me at times. I wanted her to have more depth, like a Lilian De Paul.  \n\n- **Complexity of Relationships:**  \n   - The polyamorous relationship was well-written and felt realistic, with a strong foundation to work.  \n   - However, the characters felt too young to be handling such serious, complex, and messy relationships. Aging them up would have made the dynamics more believable for me.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n   - Despite my critiques, I loved *Evocation* and found it to be a story I won’t forget anytime soon.  \n   - I appreciated the emotional depth and the way the characters grew and navigated their relationships.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evocation* is a deeply engaging and emotionally resonant novel that explores complex relationships and personal growth.

            "This urban fantasy novel primarily centers on the evolving relationship between its three main characters: David, Moira, and Rhys. While demon possession plays a significant role, it serves more as a backdrop, enhancing the narrative without overshadowing the character dynamics.",
            "David is a complex character shaped by a troubled past, including an abusive father and struggles with alcoholism. As a member of a magical family, he is being prepared to lead a secret society. In contrast, Rhys, David's ex-boyfriend, lacks magical abilities but competes for the society's loyalty. Now married to Moira, Rhys is deeply in love, adding another layer to the emotional dynamics. The characters' anger toward David and their eventual reconciliation are compellingly portrayed, making for a rich exploration of their relationships.",
            "The world-building is captivating, yet it feels less developed than the characters. I look forward to future installments that delve deeper into this aspect.",
            "The book is emotionally charged and chaotic, a style I usually don't prefer. However, it was executed so skillfully that I found myself completely captivated."

He comes from a magical family and is groomed to lead a secret society.  \n   - Rhys, David's ex-boyfriend, has no innate magical abilities but is in competition with David for the loyalty of the secret society.

I hope future books in the series will expand on this aspect.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n   - This is the first book in what is planned to be a four-book series, with each main character getting their own arc. This book focuses on David's story, and I am excited to see how the author develops the other characters and the world in subsequent installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis urban fantasy novel surprised me with its focus on character relationships and emotional drama, which were executed exceptionally well.

            "The story centers on the characters' battles with a demonic curse stemming from a deal made by David's family with the devil. This curse not only shapes the narrative but also highlights the evolving relationships and personal growth of the characters. Character-driven at its core, the plot intricately weaves the emotional and psychological journeys of David, Rhys, and Moira.",

However, as he opens up to Moira and Rhys, revealing his vulnerabilities, he becomes more relatable and well-developed. His transformation from self-destructive behavior to seeking help is compelling. In contrast, Rhys is a diligent worker who compensates for his lack of natural mystical talent with hard work and study. He deeply respects his wife while maintaining a strong bond with David. Moira emerges as the most dynamic and empowering character, her bravery and intensity driving the story forward and catalyzing the growth of both David and Rhys. The polyamorous relationship among the trio is a highlight, with each connection offering a unique intensity that complements the others. Moira plays a vital role in harmonizing the dynamics between David and Rhys, helping them become their best selves. The intimate moments shared among the characters, while not overly explicit, are profoundly touching and add significant emotional depth to the narrative.",

            "I found David and Rhys unlikable, as their actions and attitudes diminished my enjoyment of the story. Moira stood out as the only redeeming character, yet she was unfairly treated by both men, which left me feeling frustrated. Rhys’s behavior, especially his tendency to share his encounters with David after the fact, further fueled my dislike for him. Additionally, the dynamic where Moira was solely responsible for initiating conversations about polyamory, while Rhys acted on his impulses, felt unbalanced and unjust.",

She takes grandiose ideas and spins them so carefully and beautifully, making it impossible not to fall into the story. The writing is deft, effective, and artful, with lines that leave me speechless and awed even upon reflection.  \n\n- **Characterization and Portrayals:**  \n  The characterizations and portrayals in this book are exceptional. The backstories and dialogues are crafted with such depth and care that I adored them more than I can express.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  While the book is beautifully written, I found the final act a little too easy and not entirely worth the buildup that preceded it. This is the only reason it didn’t earn a full 5-star rating from me.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  Despite my minor critique, *Evocation* is a beautiful book and one of my absolute favorites of the year. The writing is so effective and evocative that it left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSt. Gibson’s *Evocation* is a masterfully written novel with stunning characterizations and artful prose. While the final act didn’t fully meet my expectations, the book as a whole is a remarkable and unforgettable read, earning it a place among my top favorites of the year.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars (due to the final act not living up to the buildup)."

            "The novel features a minimal plot, emphasizing atmosphere and character interactions over a complex storyline. It presents a quiet fantasy where magic is woven into the characters' daily lives and social hierarchy, rather than serving as a constant source of conflict. The narrative centers on the healing of a broken relationship, with the main tension stemming from David's potential haunting by a demon.",
            "The polyamorous romance between David, Rhys, and Moira is the story's focal point. David, a wealthy heir from a magical family, navigates a complex dynamic with his ex-boyfriend Rhys and Rhys's wife, Moira. While Rhys comes across as whiny and immature, making him the least compelling character, the developing relationship between Moira and David is truly captivating. The interactions among the three are deeply intimate and romantic, filled with palpable tension that drives the narrative forward.",
            "The prose is lush and gothic, featuring minimal info-dumping and rich descriptions. The book's strong gothic atmosphere aligns beautifully with its 300-page length. While it lacks explicit sex scenes, it possesses an unexpectedly erotic quality, filled with deeply intimate and romantic moments. The pacing is slow and deliberate, prioritizing character development and emotional tension over action. Overall, the tone is atmospheric and moody, offering an immersive reading experience.",
            "The magic system is subtly integrated into the characters' lives, enhancing rather than overshadowing the narrative. The world feels authentic and immersive, emphasizing the societal structure of the magical community."

David and Moira’s relationship, in particular, was a highlight, and the book’s erotic yet subtle romantic tension added depth to the story.",

            "Initially, I found the characters and plot unengaging, but the magic system drew me in. It wasn't until about 30% into the story that I became fully invested. Before reaching the final four chapters, I was leaning towards a rating of 2.5 to 3.25 stars. However, those last chapters transformed my perspective, ultimately elevating my rating to 4 stars. I appreciated the addition of Chapter 35 and another sex scene, which effectively highlighted the growth of the three main characters. The ending was revised from the original, and I loved how the author preserved the essence of Chapter 34 while adding depth to the character arcs.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Engagement and Plot Development:**  \n   - When I started the book, I wasn’t initially intrigued by the characters or the plot, but the magic system kept me engaged.  \n   - Around 30% into the story, I finally became fully intrigued by everything.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - I enjoyed the narrator, Oscar Reyes, particularly for Rhys’ and David’s chapters.  \n   - However, I wish there had been a second narrator for Moira’s chapters, as Reyes’ portrayal of her didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Character Connection and Personal Experience:**  \n   - My favorite character was Rhys, which was amusing because my name is also Rhys.  \n   - The sex scenes involving Rhys felt a little awkward due to the shared name, but this was a personal quirk rather than a critique of the scenes themselves.  \n\n- **Story Pacing and Ending:**  \n   - Before the last four chapters, I was considering a rating of 2.5-3.25 stars.  \n   - The last four chapters completely changed my perspective, elevating the book to a 4-star rating for me.  \n   - I appreciated the addition of an extra chapter (Chapter 35) and the inclusion of another sex scene, which helped showcase the growth of all three main characters.  \n   - The ending was altered from the original version, and I loved how the author kept the core of Chapter 34 intact while adding more depth to the character arcs.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n   - I recommend this book to readers looking for a slower-paced fantasy with a unique magic system and a polyamorous relationship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started slow for me, the magic system and the gripping final chapters made it a rewarding read. The audiobook narration was strong overall, though a second narrator for Moira’s chapters would have improved the experience. The character growth, especially in the revised ending, was a highlight, and I ultimately enjoyed the story enough to give it a 4-star rating.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars."

            "The story is more character-driven than plot-driven, leaving me wanting a stronger focus on the plot. The curse and its resolution feel underdeveloped; Rhys discovers a crucial thread early on, but it isn’t explored until the final hour, making the resolution seem rushed and unsatisfying. The haunted house, a key element, is only relevant for one chapter before being forgotten. Additionally, the society and its rituals, which are central to David and Rhys' motivations, lack depth, with most of the narrative devoted to social interactions rather than the summoning of demons. The pacing is uneven, with time passing quickly during critical moments, which diminishes the tension.

The forgiveness following Rhys' infidelity felt rushed, and Moira's swift acceptance of polyamory could have been explored with more nuance. Additionally, David and Rhys' relationship came across as toxic and volatile, lacking a clear explanation for their behavior.

The plot centers on an adult couple who adopt a man subtly possessed by a demon he cannot escape. The twist is that the couple comprises his ex-boyfriend, Rhys, and Rhys’s wife, Moira.

Initially wary of David due to his past actions toward Rhys, she ultimately treats him with care, revealing her depth and compassion. **David:** Starting as a self-centered brat, David learns through Moira and Rhys that he doesn’t always need to be the center of attention; he can find fulfillment in supporting those he loves. **Rhys:** A hardworking man grappling with anger issues, Rhys strives to provide for his family while dealing with the toxic dynamic with David.

Navigating their interactions was both fascinating and entertaining. The tension and chemistry between them kept me thoroughly invested.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Author:**  \n  This is my second book by S.T. Gibson, and I am a huge fan of their work. The writing is dramatic and immersive, perfectly capturing the messy, emotional, and occult-driven world of the characters. I would read anything this author writes.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook was narrated by Oscar Reyes, and it was a fantastic experience. The narrator did an excellent job of distinguishing the characters and bringing them to life. The narration added an extra layer of enjoyment to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The combination of occult themes, complex character dynamics, and the author’s writing style made it a captivating read. The audiobook format enhanced the experience, making it even more enjoyable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evocation* is a messy, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining novel with strong occult themes and deeply engaging character dynamics. The plot, while present, takes a backseat to the fascinating relationships between the characters. The audiobook narration by Oscar Reyes is exceptional, adding to the overall enjoyment. I highly recommend this book, especially to fans of witchy and occult stories.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The relationship dynamics were well-crafted, but they lacked the emotional depth found in *An Education in Malice* and *A Dowry of Blood*. I was somewhat disappointed, as the emotional connection didn't resonate as strongly as in the author's previous works.",

However, I anticipated a stronger fantasy element in *Evocation* based on its marketing, which it ultimately did not deliver.

            "The story begins slowly but gradually evolves into an emotionally charged narrative. The plot primarily serves as a backdrop for the characters' relationships and emotions, rather than being the main focus. The urgency of the plot only emerges toward the end, which may not satisfy readers seeking a fast-paced, action-driven experience. While the conclusion centers on magic, it raises questions about the mechanics of certain magical elements, leaving me with a sense of ambiguity that slightly diminished my overall satisfaction.",
            "The supporting characters, such as David’s chaos magician half-sister and Moira the astrologer, enriched the story, and I hope to see more of them in future installments. However, the limited exploration of their magical practices—like astrology and chaos magic—seemed like a missed opportunity for deeper world-building. On a positive note, the characters' willingness to discuss their feelings added a layer of authenticity and relatability to the narrative.",
            "The magic system is rooted in real-world occult practices, which I found intriguing. However, the book assumes some prior knowledge, potentially leaving unfamiliar readers confused. The juxtaposition of everyday modern life—like rush hour traffic and brunch—with the hidden world of the occult is well-executed and adds a unique flavor to the story. I found the Society’s High/Ceremonial Magic elements less engaging and wished for a deeper exploration of other magical traditions, such as chaos magic and astrology.",
            "This book offers a captivating aesthetic and atmosphere, appealing to readers who appreciate morally complex characters and emotional depth. While it explores themes of wealth, privilege, and the dynamics of exclusive societies—such as the male-only Society—I found these elements less engaging. The contemporary setting, which intertwines everyday concerns with the occult, may resonate more with some readers than the historical backdrop of the author's previous work, *Dowry of Blood*.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth**  \n   - The book shines in its emotional depth and character-driven narrative. The characters are morally grey and entangled in complex emotions, which I found compelling.  \n   - The interactions between characters, particularly their willingness to talk about their feelings, added a layer of authenticity and relatability.  \n   - The emotional whirlwind created by the author kept me engaged, even though the plot took time to build urgency.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story has a slightly slow start, but it gradually builds into an emotionally charged narrative.  \n   - The plot serves more as a backdrop to the characters' relationships and emotions rather than being the central focus.  \n   - The urgency of the plot only becomes apparent closer to the end, which might not appeal to readers looking for a fast-paced, action-driven story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System**  \n   - The magic system draws from real-world occult practices, which I found intriguing. However, the book assumes some prior knowledge of these practices, which might leave unfamiliar readers confused.  \n   - The contrast between everyday modern life (e.g., rush hour traffic, brunch) and the hidden world of the occult was well-executed and added a unique flavor to the story.  \n   - The Society’s High/Ceremonial Magic elements were less engaging for me, and I wished for more exploration of other magical traditions, such as chaos magic and astrology.  \n\n- **Themes and Aesthetic**  \n   - The book delivers a strong aesthetic and \"vibes,\" appealing to readers who enjoy morally complex characters and emotional depth.  \n   - Themes of wealth, privilege, and the dynamics of exclusive societies (like the male-only Society) are touched upon, though I found these aspects less compelling.  \n   - The contemporary setting, blending mundane concerns with the occult, might resonate more with some readers compared to the historical setting of the author’s previous work, *Dowry of Blood*.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Future Potential**  \n   - Supporting characters like David’s chaos magician half-sister and Moira, the astrologer, added depth to the story. I hope to see more of them in future books.  \n   - The lack of detailed exploration into their magical practices (e.g., astrology, chaos magic) felt like a missed opportunity for deeper world-building.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution**  \n   - The ending, while focused on magic, left me with questions about how and why certain magical elements worked the way they did. This lack of clarity slightly diminished my satisfaction with the conclusion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evocation* is a character-driven novel that excels in emotional depth and morally complex relationships. While the plot takes time to build momentum and the magic system assumes some prior knowledge, the book’s strong aesthetic, relatable themes, and engaging characters make it a worthwhile read. Fans of the author’s previous work, *Dowry of Blood*, will likely appreciate the contemporary setting and the focus on emotional entanglement.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This concise book, under 300 pages, offers a generally good pace, though it could benefit from more extensive worldbuilding. The thrilling finale, marked by a ticking clock, heightens tension and sets the stage for the next installment. The story is an emotionally charged exploration of sorcerers and possession within a captivating fantasy world. It follows a group of occultists in Boston, emphasizing interpersonal relationships and rich lore. Central to the plot is David Aristarkhov, a prosecutor and occultist who becomes possessed and turns to his ex-boyfriend Rhys and Rhys's wife Moira for help. The revelation of a family curse, along with the characters' emotional connections, adds depth and tension to the narrative.",
            "David serves as the emotional core of the story, grappling with sobriety and the scars of a toxic upbringing. His complex character is complemented by the deep yet tumultuous relationship between Rhys and Moira, whose interactions with David introduce fresh dynamics and challenges. The evolving connections, especially between Moira and David, are well-crafted and engaging. Additionally, the volatile history between Rhys and David, shaped by David's struggles with alcoholism, adds depth to their interactions.",
            "The author's evocative and immersive writing excels in character-driven storytelling. Authentic dialogue and interactions enrich the emotional depth of the narrative.",
            "Set against the backdrop of contemporary Boston, this story effectively introduces a secret society of sorcerers, offering captivating glimpses into a hidden magical realm. The Society, reminiscent of an old-school men’s club, ultimately addresses its exclusion of women in a positive light. The Beacon Hill house, with its occult library and haunting ambiance, serves as a striking setting. While the worldbuilding is impressive, there is a yearning for a deeper exploration of magic, demon summoning, and the political dynamics within the magical community.",
            "The story delves into polyamory and intricate emotional bonds, a hallmark of the author's work. Relationships take center stage, emphasizing love, trust, and the reevaluation of connections. The emotional and magical ties between characters propel the narrative forward."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Evocation is a captivating start, blending urban fantasy with rich character dynamics and a tantalizing magical world. While the worldbuilding could have been more detailed, the emotional depth of the characters and the thrilling finale make it a highly enjoyable read. Fans of contemporary urban fantasy with a strong relationship focus will find much to love here.",

The unresolved tension between David and Rhys adds depth to the narrative. Moira shines as a character—gentle yet fierce, confident, self-aware, and warm.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n   - Initially, I wasn’t sure if Gibson’s writing style was for me, but this book completely changed my mind.  \n   - I was pleasantly surprised and hooked quickly, staying immersed throughout the story.  \n   - The plot isn’t plainly laid out, which made it a bit tricky to get into at first, but I came to view this as a positive as the story unfolded.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Complexity:**  \n   - The story feels like two beautifully intertwined plotlines: one focused on character development and the other on the world’s magic.  \n   - The dual plotlines make the beginning a bit challenging but ultimately rewarding.  \n   - The book is driven by character evolution, both individually and as a group, which is a central focus.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - The story is told through three POVs: Rhys (a sorcerer), Moira (a witch), and David (Rhys’s former lover).  \n   - Rhys and Moira are a married couple navigating Rhys’s ambitions within a male-only secret society with real magic.  \n   - David and Rhys have unresolved tension, and their dynamic adds depth to the story.  \n   - Moira is a standout character—gentle yet fierce, confident, self-aware, and warm.  \n   - Personally, I preferred David over Rhys due to his spunk and personality.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n   - The world features a secret society with real magic, reminiscent of the Blackwood society from the *Sherlock Holmes* movie (2009).  \n   - The society’s politics and the race for the high priest position add intrigue.  \n   - The world isn’t fully queer-normative; while the inner circle is accepting, the broader society seems tolerant but with limits.  \n   - Race dynamics are briefly touched upon, adding another layer to the story.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n   - The audiobook is highly recommended. The narrator’s breathy tone took some getting used to, but once acclimated, it was smooth sailing.  \n   - The audiobook helps maintain the pace, especially given the book’s complex beginning, and avoids the pacing issues some reviewers have mentioned.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book far exceeded my expectations. I found myself deeply engaged with the characters, the intricate plotlines, and the richly built world. The audiobook enhanced the experience, and I’m excited to see where the series goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating (likely 4.5/5 or 5/5)."

The way she writes her characters makes me fall in love with them so quickly.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I saw so much of myself in David, who pushes everyone away as a punishment to himself and is afraid to let anyone near him in case they see how broken he really is.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  Plot-wise, it did go a bit slow. It takes a good while for the story to dive into the main issue.

Gibson’s books since I first read *The Dowry of Blood*, and I’ve been eagerly anticipating *Evocation*’s release from the minute I heard about it.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The novel introduced me to three instant favorite characters: David, Rhys, and Moira. They are brilliant, complicated, honest, flawed, and passionate. I really enjoyed each of their perspectives. Their relationship dynamics, both as a group and in pairs, are so interwoven that it’s difficult to predict exactly which direction they’re heading in. I found myself rooting for them all at different times, both romantically and platonically, which shows how attached I became. I have a huge soft spot for David and Rhys in particular, and I can’t wait to see where the future takes them.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  *Evocation* is quite dark in parts, with an overall atmosphere that always has a black cloud hanging over it. I was constantly on edge while reading, wondering what was going on and who would be most affected. Invoking spirits and magic is never a lighthearted pastime, and the serious consequences of meddling with such things are always remembered here.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  The story is character-driven and sets a middling pace early on. It weaves its well-written magic instantly and is never afraid to realistically depict the unusual lives of its protagonists. It’s a slow build of a story, more like an indie film than a cinematic blockbuster, but it successfully leaves its mark.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Works:**  \n  I’m already looking forward to the upcoming sequel and prequel, and I truly can’t wait to be reunited with David, Rhys, and Moira.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evocation* met all my expectations and introduced me to three unforgettable characters. Its dark atmosphere, intricate relationships, and well-crafted pacing made it a compelling read.

She respected Rhys's feelings for David and encouraged him to confront their unresolved emotions from the past. Despite their complicated history, it was evident that Rhys and David still cared for each other. I appreciated the initial tension between them and how fiercely Moira defended Rhys from his ex. The slow development of friendship and love between Moira and David was heartwarming, and their natural comfort with each other was delightful. The bond between Moira and Rhys was tender and strong, with their love never in doubt.

I appreciated the depiction of healthy relationships and look forward to seeing more of this in future books.",

Although we learn about The Society—an all-male group studying magic akin to historical alchemist societies—we don’t see enough of its inner workings, rituals, or significance. This absence of exploration into The Society’s structure and activities left me wanting more, especially since it plays a central role in the story."

However, I felt she deserved better representation in her relationships. **David:** In contrast to Rhys, David felt like a fully realized character, complete with flaws, mistakes, and growth, making him much more relatable and dynamic.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n   - Gibson’s lyrical prose is present, as in her previous works, but I felt it didn’t fit as well in this novel as it did in her others.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The modern setting was initially hard for me to get into, but it grew on me as the story progressed.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The book is very slow-paced, which is something readers should be aware of before diving in.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the spiritual aspects of the story, though I wished there had been more of it. Since this is the first book in a series, I’m hopeful we’ll see more of this in future installments.  \n   - The focus of this book seemed to be more on the relationships between the characters rather than the plot itself.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - **Rhys:** I didn’t like Rhys; he felt indifferent and not “real,” as if his true nature hadn’t been revealed yet. His character came across as bland.  \n   - **Moira:** Moira is a sweetheart, and I think we’d be best friends if she existed in real life. However, I felt she deserved better in terms of how her relationships were portrayed.  \n   - **David:** In contrast to Rhys, David felt like a fully realized person with flaws, mistakes, and growth. He was much more relatable and dynamic.  \n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**  \n   - The relationship between Rhys and Moira lacked spark, and when David entered the dynamic, it felt more like Rhys got his way while Moira passively accepted it. Moira seemed more like a bystander in their evolving relationship.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book wasn’t entirely for me, it wasn’t bad either. The lyrical prose, modern setting, and slow pacing took some getting used to, but the spiritual elements and potential for character growth kept me engaged. The relationships, particularly between Rhys, Moira, and David, felt uneven, with Moira deserving better. Despite its flaws, the book shows a lot of potential, and I’m curious to see how the series evolves. I plan to read the next books in the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Actual rating: 3.5 ⭐️"

            "The book is highly character-driven, and while I would have appreciated a bit more plot, I was in the mood for a relaxed, character-focused read.",
            "Rhys possesses an amusingly relatable intuition reminiscent of a Roomba—though I must defend my own Roomba, Mauri, as the more intuitive one. Moira, the love of my life, is a joy to read about, perfectly resonating with the reader's emotions. David, a miserable and possessed boy, adds depth to my character collection, despite his gloom. I particularly enjoy the dynamic between the characters, highlighted by a humorous exchange: \"Listen, we're not... I'm gay, and she's—got standards.\"",
            "This book perfectly suited my mood for a cozy day in bed, filled with laughter over its delightful characters. It was engaging enough to pull me out of my reading slump, which I celebrate with enthusiasm. The humor is a standout feature, with memorable quotes and interactions that rank among the funniest I've encountered in a while. The author's wit also shines through in their commentary, particularly in their amusing musings about their Roomba and self-aware jokes about their own humor."

            "The climax felt somewhat rushed and underwhelming.",
            "Moira shines like the sun at the center of the universe, her brilliance enhanced by David's cool, silvery light. Rhys experiences a complex mix of anguish and longing as he watches them glide through the ballroom like celestial bodies—not quite jealousy, but something softer and more treacherous. The characters are intricately intertwined, and I enjoyed following their journey of self-discovery. Moira was my favorite; her sweetness and kindness make her a comforting presence, and her friendship with David was the highlight of the book. In contrast, Rhys felt the least compelling of the trio, and I found myself less invested in his perspective compared to the others.",

            "As a fan of witchcraft, magic, and the occult, I found this story to be a delightful read. However, \"Evocation\" leans more towards character dynamics than fantasy elements. With minimal action, those seeking an adventurous plot may find themselves disappointed."

            "This romance is refreshingly messy and human, perfectly aligning with the urban fantasy genre. The triad relationship subverts expectations, as the bond between David and Moira proves more intriguing than the typical will-they-won't-they tension with Rhys. Their closeness and psychic connection are tender and full of potential, making their relationship particularly compelling. The author frames it as a V, emphasizing intimacy that transcends mere sexual attraction, which adds depth to the portrayal of queerness. David's strong submissive undertones spark curiosity about his dynamic with Moira, while Rhys grapples with power issues and Moira confronts her magical reckoning. Additionally, Leda is poised to become a more significant character in future installments.",

            "David is undoubtedly the standout character who made the story compelling. His complex, morally ambiguous nature, coupled with his daddy issues, created a fascinating protagonist. I was so captivated by his journey that I could have easily read a thousand more pages about his life. While I enjoyed Rhys and Moira, I felt less connected to them; they came across as somewhat one-dimensional, and I believe the author could have developed them further. The spark and tension between David and Rhys were electrifying—I’m a sucker for a toxic dynamic where two people are irresistibly drawn to each other despite the odds. The relationship between David and Moira was intriguing and refreshingly different, with a sweetness I appreciated, but it ultimately didn’t deliver the emotional impact I had hoped for.",

His complex, morally grey nature combined with his daddy issues made him a fascinating protagonist.  \n   - I was so captivated by his journey that I could have easily read a thousand more pages about his life.  \n   - I did enjoy Rhys and Moira as well, but I didn’t feel as connected to them. They seemed a bit one-dimensional, and I believe the author could have fleshed them out more.  \n\n- **Character Relationships:**  \n   - The spark and tension between David and Rhys were electrifying. I’m a sucker for a toxic dynamic where two people are irresistibly drawn to each other despite everything.  \n   - The dynamic between David and Moira was also intriguing and refreshingly different, with a sweetness that I enjoyed.  \n   - However, the overall relationship didn't quite pack the punch I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - At times, it felt like the author was treading water with the plot instead of delving deeper into the characters and their relationships.  \n   - I didn’t mind the slower pace of the plot; I tend to prefer character-driven stories anyway.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"Evocation\" was a deeply engaging and enjoyable read for me, largely due to David’s compelling character and the electrifying dynamics between him and Rhys. While some characters and relationships could have been more developed, and the plot occasionally felt stagnant, the story held my attention completely, and I would gladly revisit its world.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story centers on Moira, David, and Rhys, with their communication and interactions taking precedence. While the plot primarily serves to advance the narrative, I found myself deeply invested in their relationships. However, my main concern lies with the portrayal of Moira, a woman of color. Although she is depicted as a strong, self-assured role model for young girls, by the end of the book, she feels diminished to a mere foil for the tension between the two male protagonists. The men often behave like immature teenagers, leaving Moira to shoulder the emotional burden and facilitate communication, which ultimately left me dissatisfied.",
            "This book prioritizes character development over magic, exploring a relationship that remains largely misunderstood and unaccepted in contemporary society. This focus adds a refreshing and unexpected dimension to the story.",
            "I approached this book with minimal expectations, a mindset shaped by my experience with *An Education in Malice*, which I ultimately did not finish. This low bar turned out to be beneficial, enhancing my enjoyment of the novel."

        "conclusion": "This was an intriguing and enjoyable read, though I have mixed feelings about certain aspects, particularly the treatment of Moira as a character. The character-driven narrative and exploration of complex relationships were highlights, but the imbalance in emotional labor and representation left me wanting more. Nonetheless, I am optimistic about what comes next and look forward to seeing how the story evolves.",

This set a low bar that worked in favor of my enjoyment of this novel.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**\n   - The book is less about magic and more of a character-driven novel. It focuses on a type of relationship that is still not widely accepted or understood in modern society. This was a refreshing and unexpected aspect of the story.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**\n   - The story revolves around Moira, David, and Rhys, with their communication and interactions taking center stage. The plot serves primarily to move the story forward, and I found myself deeply invested in their relationships.\n\n- **Representation and Character Treatment:**\n   - My main drawback with the novel is the treatment of Moira, a woman of color (WOC). While she is portrayed as a strong, self-assured woman—a role model for young girls—by the end of the book, she felt reduced to a foil for creating tension between the two male protagonists. The men often acted like immature teenagers, leaving Moira to carry the emotional load and encourage communication, which left me dissatisfied.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation for the Sequel:**\n   - Despite my reservations, I enjoyed the book immensely and am excited to see where the next installment takes the story. I have a feeling it will address the concerns I had with Book 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis was an intriguing and enjoyable read, though I have mixed feelings about certain aspects, particularly the treatment of Moira as a character. The character-driven narrative and exploration of complex relationships were highlights, but the imbalance in emotional labor and representation left me wanting more. Nonetheless, I am optimistic about the sequel and look forward to seeing how the story evolves.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- I teeter between three and four stars due to the drawbacks mentioned, but my overall enjoyment leans toward a higher rating."

            "The book follows David Aristarkhov, a psychic prodigy who has become a high-powered attorney and medium, as he navigates his complicated relationship with Rhys, his ex-boyfriend and rival within their secret society. The narrative delves deeply into the dynamics between David, Rhys, and Rhys's wife, Moira, highlighting unresolved feelings and past conflicts. Their intertwined relationships serve as a central theme, emphasizing the emotional struggles and interactions that define their lives.",

The character-driven focus, particularly on David and Rhys’s relationship, was engaging, but I wished for deeper exploration of other dynamics, like David and Moira’s relationship, and the occult elements. Despite its shortcomings, I’m intrigued enough to continue, anticipating bigger reveals in the next installment.",

Before that, I struggled to get into it and enjoy it, which was disappointing. However, after that point, I quite enjoyed it and devoured that section very quickly.\n   - I wished it delved deeper into polyamory a bit more; it really just skirted the topic instead. However, it was refreshing to see it included in a book.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - I love how S.J. Gibson writes, and her previous books have been enjoyable. While the language and writing style in this book were still present and something I thoroughly enjoyed, this book didn’t hit the spot for me as the others did.\n\n- **World-Building and Depth:**\n   - I felt certain aspects, like chaos magic, were skimmed over as if we were supposed to know them already. This left me wanting more explanation or exploration.\n   - The book leaned a little more toward plot and world-building than being character-driven, which I think could have made it feel like a better book overall.\n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**\n   - I felt like we should get a prequel about David and Rhys, as their backstory seemed intriguing. Reading online, it seems there will be a sequel instead, which I’m curious about.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**\n   - The inclusion of polyamory was refreshing, though I wished it had been explored more deeply.\n   - Trigger warnings for child abuse, alcoholism, polyamory, and infidelity were noted, which are important for readers to be aware of.\n\n- **Overall Potential and Uniqueness:**\n   - This isn’t a negative review.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - I liked this book more than *An Education in Malice* but not nearly as much as *A Dowry of Blood*.  \n  - Despite this, I enjoyed it for the most part.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - If you’re looking for a plot-driven book, this isn’t it.  \n  - I couldn’t get fully invested until about halfway through, when I finally felt like I saw where the story was going.  \n  - It felt like a very long prelude or pilot episode, setting up the rest of the series.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The story seemed to rely on the couples to drive the narrative, but I only truly liked one of the characters: David.  \n  - David had a deep backstory, and I’ll always love snarky, quick-witted characters—they really work for me.  \n  - Rhys fell flat for me, stuck in a repetitive cycle of “I love my wife, but I can’t deny my ex.”  \n  - Moira was lovely and caring, but I never fully understood her.  \n\n- **World-Building and Themes:**  \n  - I really enjoyed the occult elements and the magic system.  \n  - Now that I’ve read this, I’m definitely interested in exploring the rest of the series.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  - Thank you to RB Media for providing the audiobook ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book wasn’t as strong as *A Dowry of Blood*, I still found it enjoyable overall. The slow start and lack of investment in most characters were drawbacks, but the occult elements, magic system, and David’s character kept me engaged. It feels like a setup for the rest of the series, and I’m curious to see where it goes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

            "The advertised plot, centered on David's battle with a psychic illness and a centuries-old demonic deal, constitutes only about 40% of the story. The narrative lacks depth, offering minimal exploration of the curse or meaningful interaction with the demon, aside from a brief exorcism scene. Additionally, the pacing is uneven, with excessive focus on characters' internal monologues at the expense of advancing the main plot.",
            "**David** is a charismatic yet manipulative character shaped by a traumatic past. Throughout the story, he evolves into a more selfless individual, taking responsibility for his mistakes and offering sincere apologies. **Rhys**, on the other hand, is an insufferable and egotistical character whose self-righteousness fuels much of the conflict. His treatment of Moira is particularly troubling, as he fails to genuinely value her. **Moira** is poorly developed, characterized by clichéd traits (such as calling people “peach” and her overly sweet tea). While she is strong, she often exists to serve the needs of the male characters, leaving her underexplored. The relationship between Rhys and David is volatile and toxic, with Moira frequently caught in the crossfire of their unresolved issues. Rhys's relationship with Moira lacks genuine affection; he sees her more as an ideal than as a person. In contrast, David and Moira's relationship matures into a wholesome, platonic partnership, marked by David's heartfelt apologies for his past behavior.",

The publisher's summary may mislead readers into anticipating a fast-paced, dark magical adventure; however, the story unfolds as a slow-burn literary romance set against a modern occult backdrop. At times, the plot feels drawn out, and the world-building and magical elements lack the immersive allure one might hope for.",

However, as the story unfolds, he evolves into a more nuanced and engaging character.

The dynamics between Moira and Rhys are particularly compelling, showcasing effective communication, trust, and conflict resolution.

It features strong queer representation and tackles nuanced issues like inclusivity in male-dominated spaces and the diversity of relationship structures, including both monogamous and polyamorous dynamics. The narrative emphasizes that relationships are not about perfection but rather about accountability, growth, and navigating conflicts.",

Rhys, ambitious and hailing from South Boston, relies on his wife Moira for emotional support, while his rivalry with David creates tension in their interactions.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**\n   - The book primarily focuses on relationships—romantic, familial, and platonic. David, Rhys, and Moira each have complex backstories and dynamics that drive the narrative.\n   - David is portrayed as arrogant, cynical, and tactless, shaped by his abusive father who saw him as a tool for success. His only meaningful connection is with his half-sister.\n   - Rhys, raised in South Boston, is ambitious and relies on his wife Moira for emotional stability. His rivalry with David adds tension to their interactions.\n   - Moira, a witch with a secret psychic ability, struggles with her own insecurities and resentment toward David for his past actions. Her relationship with Rhys is central to her character.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The story revolves around David's \"spirit sickness\" and the trio's efforts to uncover its cause, which leads to unexpected revelations.\n   - Themes of alcoholism and patriarchal societies are touched upon, adding depth to the narrative.\n   - The book explores the balance between ambition and human connection, as well as the consequences of generational wealth and power.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic:**\n   - The occult Society and magic are integral to the setting, but the story leans more heavily on relationships than on magical elements.\n   - The magical aspects could have been more prominent, as the story could have functioned similarly without the occult backdrop.\n   - The author hints at a deeper exploration of magic in future installments of the series.\n\n- **Writing Style and Craft:**\n   - The writing is a step up from the author's previous works, showcasing growth and refinement in storytelling.\n   - The narrative is well-crafted, with attention to detail in character development and emotional arcs.\n\n- **Pacing and Payoff:**\n   - The relationship development is engaging, but the romantic payoff is delayed until the end.\n   - The balance between romance and magic could have been better, leaving room for improvement in future books.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evocation* by S.T. Gibson is a character-driven novel that excels in exploring complex relationships and emotional growth. While the magical elements take a backseat to the interpersonal dynamics, the story is well-written and engaging. The themes of ambition, connection, and generational power add depth, and the author's growth in craft is evident. Despite some pacing issues and a desire for more magical focus, the book sets a strong foundation for the series. I gave it four out of five stars, rounding up for its strengths in character development and storytelling.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 4 out of 5 stars."

            "At its heart, this story revolves around David's journey to reconcile with his ex-boyfriend, Rhys, while also nurturing his relationship with his wife, Moira. A demonic possession serves as the central conflict, uniting the three characters in their quest to alleviate David's deteriorating psychic condition. The narrative skillfully balances love and plot, though it offers only a hint of spice (0.5/5 on the spice scale). The beginning can be somewhat ambiguous and confusing, with references to past events that are clarified later. The deep history among the characters adds emotional depth but can also complicate the storyline. Overall, the emotional intensity is palpable, drawing readers into the characters' experiences.",
            "The relationships among David, Rhys, and Moira are intricately layered and emotionally resonant. David still has feelings for Rhys, who is deeply in love with Moira, and she reciprocates his affection. Moira's confidence in Rhys's love and her understanding of David's significance to him enrich her character. The evolving dynamic between Moira and David is particularly compelling, as they share a unique bond through their mutual afflictions and gifts. The exploration of a potential polyamorous relationship adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. The characters are complex, with their depths gradually revealed throughout the story. David's relapse serves as a crucial turning point, prompting him to recognize what he truly lacks in life. Meanwhile, Rhys's natural leadership qualities position him as the ideal candidate for the role of High Priest, despite David's own strengths.",
            "The author presents magic and the occult almost as a religion, showcasing diverse perspectives from various characters. Moira and Rhys see magic as a spiritual experience, while David views it as a skill to master. Each character has different specialties and comfort levels; for instance, Rhys diligently hones his abilities, whereas Moira and David possess natural gifts in specific areas. This nuanced approach to magic enriches the worldbuilding and distinguishes the story.",
            "The book provides a distinctive exploration of dark magic and the occult, delving into the complexities of these realms."

        "conclusion": "This novel is a captivating blend of dark magic, complex relationships, and emotional depth. The unique portrayal of magic, the evolving dynamics between the characters, and the exploration of themes like love, redemption, and self-discovery make it a standout read. While the beginning may be a bit confusing, the story’s emotional resonance and rich worldbuilding more than make up for it.",

            "The portrayal of relationships, especially the polyamorous dynamic, was skillfully executed and felt authentic. It was refreshing to encounter characters who were romantically interested in one another without a physical component—a rare dynamic in fiction. The author effectively introduced the core cast, providing a strong “snapshot” of each character early on. The story alternates between three points of view, and this early character development was both crucial and well-crafted. The characters consistently stood out, with their slightly exaggerated traits adding to the overall enjoyment of the narrative.",

While the premise of David's generational curse and his quest for help from Rhys and Moira is intriguing, it often takes a backseat. The physical and emotional ramifications of the curse on David and those around him are not fully explored, missing opportunities to elevate the stakes and horror elements.

This intimate portrayal makes their growth and relationships feel genuine and impactful.",

            "While *Evocation* has its flaws, it remains an engaging read, particularly for fans of character-driven fantasy.

            "The novel explores the lore behind David's personality and his relationships, but the unique paranormal elements of *Odd Spirits* take a backseat. The narrative shifts its focus primarily to relationship dynamics, particularly the exploration of polyamory, which ultimately overshadows the urban magic systems and paranormal themes.",
            "David emerges as a standout character in *Evocation*, evolving from an unlikeable figure in *Odd Spirits* to a compelling protagonist. His complexity, arrogance, and vulnerability are thoroughly explored, making him the novel's driving force. His privileged upbringing, relationship with Rhys, and his father's demonic bargain add depth to his character. David's unapologetic nature, with all its messiness, makes him far more engaging than the other protagonists. In contrast, Rhys and Moira feel underdeveloped, serving primarily as supporting characters focused on their marriage dynamics and the potential for a polyamorous relationship. Their repetitive discussions about ethical non-monogamy, while realistic, become tedious and detract from the plot's momentum.",

            "David is a well-developed character, and I enjoyed exploring his complexities. His self-absorbed, workaholic nature, shaped by wealth and privilege, is compelling. The story skillfully unravels his layers, revealing that his gruff exterior stems from repressed trauma, with demon possession serving as a powerful metaphor for his unresolved issues. I appreciated his growth toward vulnerability and am eager to see how he evolves in future books. However, the romantic elements fell flat for me; the polyamory storyline felt stiff and forced. The relationships could have benefited from deeper development and communication, perhaps requiring a longer format to fully explore them. Despite this, I found Moira, Rhys, and David intriguing as individual characters and am curious about their future dynamics.",

Understanding that the story centers on relationship dynamics and drama, with urban fantasy elements in the background, enriched my reading experience. However, the initial conflict between Moira, Rhys, and David felt unclear, leading me to believe that reading the prequel novella might be necessary for full comprehension."

While the world-building and romantic elements could have been more developed, the book’s strengths lie in its compelling protagonist and emotional depth. It left me curious about the future of the characters and the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 out of 5 stars."

            "The plot is intriguing, featuring a dark and mysterious premise centered on magic and a deal with the Devil. The gripping initial setup, where David becomes possessed during a routine medium session, draws the reader in. However, the story feels underdeveloped, as it places too much emphasis on character relationships at the expense of world-building and the magic system.",
            "The characters, particularly David, Rhys, and Moira, are well-developed and embody a compelling mix of arrogance and likability that aligns perfectly with the dark academia theme. I became deeply invested in their relationships, especially the dynamic between David, his ex Rhys, and Rhys's new wife, Moira. Through David's perspective, I grew to appreciate Moira and Rhys, and their views enhanced my understanding of David. However, the emphasis on their complicated relationship sometimes overshadowed other significant aspects of the story.",
            "The author's writing is both atmospheric and immersive. From the very first pages, I was captivated by the enchanting vibes and overall tone of the book. The vivid descriptions of settings, whether cozy or haunted, allowed me to easily envision myself in the characters' homes or relishing the beautifully depicted summer days and evenings. The dark academia aesthetic, centered on life after school and infused with secret society intrigue, was especially appealing.",
            "The introduction of different types of magic and their practitioners lacked clarity, leaving me craving more detailed explanations and research—elements I particularly appreciate in academia-focused fantasy."

I look forward to continuing the story, hoping for more exploration of the magic system and world in future installments.",

Tension escalates as David, along with Rhys and Moira, delves into the dark forces surrounding Beacon Hill house, unearthing perilous truths about David’s lineage. While the narrative effectively balances high-stakes action with character-driven moments, the pacing of relationship developments could benefit from greater nuance.",

While the exploration of polyamory is a significant theme, the rapid development of intimacy between Moira and David feels rushed and unconvincing.

            "I was somewhat disappointed that the story lacked a concrete resolution, particularly regarding the failure to prevent the completion of the demon contract. It felt designed to create intrigue for potential future installments. While the hints provided suggested a pause, it reminded me of how I sometimes overlook crucial details in mysteries that tie everything together. Initially, I thought David might resort to morally dubious tactics, like his forefathers, by having male children to stall the contract. However, I appreciated that he rejected the idea of proceeding without consent. Concepts like adoption or using IVF with Moira as a surrogate seemed far-fetched, especially given how late the contract details were revealed.",
            "I would have liked to see more interaction with the contracted demon to better understand the author's characterization of such a being. The dynamic between Moira, David, and Rhys was engaging enough to compensate for the sidelining of David’s generational family curse. I empathized with Moira, who had to navigate her role as the ideal partner in a negotiated polyamorous relationship, remaining composed even amidst uncertainty. At times, the narrative seemed more emotionally invested in Rhys and David, which overshadowed her experience.",
            "Moira’s astrology is well-researched, but I would have liked to see a deeper exploration of Rhys’ summoning techniques and David’s scrying. The emphasis on exact birth times and locations made the astrology feel somewhat inaccessible to me. This distance allowed me to be more accepting of Rhys’ ambition-driven approach to magic, as summoning offered him a way in without the innate skills that Moira and David possess.",

She had to be the chillest, even when things were still vague, while the narrative seemed more emotionally invested in Rhys and David at times.  \n\n- **Magic Systems and Research:**  \n   - Moira’s astrology felt well-researched, though I wished for more exploration of Rhys’ summoning techniques and David’s scrying.  \n   - I couldn’t fully appreciate the astrology aspects, as the need for exact birth times and locations felt closed off to me personally. This distance also made me more tolerant of Rhys’ ambition-driven approach to magic, as summoning provided him an entry point without requiring innate skills like Moira and David.  \n\n- **Humor and Setting Details:**  \n   - I respect Gibson’s restraint in waiting until the first 100 pages to mention Dunkin’ Donuts in a story set in Boston.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had a strong aesthetic appeal and intriguing magical systems, but the lack of a concrete resolution and the back-burner treatment of the main plot left me wanting more. The relationships between the characters were compelling, though Moira’s role felt underappreciated at times. I’m curious to see how these elements develop in potential sequels.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Rhys, on the other hand, is naïve, and his overly affectionate relationship with Moira can feel cloying at times.

The evolving dynamics among the three characters, especially Rhys's rekindled connection with David, serve as a central focus of the story.",

            "The pacing of the book begins slowly and varies throughout, making it initially difficult to engage with the story. However, it ultimately becomes captivating. The plot centers on David's possession by a malevolent demon and his dependence on Rhys and Moira for salvation, fostering emotional and relational growth among the trio.",

David is a complex protagonist—flawed yet deeply caring, particularly towards Rhys and Moira. His struggles with trust and his upbringing make him relatable. Rhys is determined and fiercely protective of his loved ones, while Moira brings a radiant positivity that balances the group dynamic.

            "David's character arc is compelling, depicting a blustering, arrogant man who, at his core, is a wounded child. His journey toward vulnerability, love, and authenticity is engaging. However, the story glosses over the severe abuse he suffered at the hands of his father during childhood. This trauma is mentioned only briefly and is never fully addressed, aside from the symbolic removal of his father's ghost, which feels inadequate.\n\nRhys, as the central figure in the triad, engages in romantic and sexual relationships with both David and Moira, which is intriguing. However, his character feels inconsistent, oscillating between being a hyper-focused academic, a bitter ex-boyfriend, a devoted husband, an insecure power player, and a morally rigid sorcerer. These traits lack a unifying thread, making him difficult to fully grasp. I hope future installments provide more clarity on his character.\n\nIn contrast, Moira is well-developed and cohesive. Her traits and motivations are clear, making her relatable. The question for her moving forward is how she will be challenged and grow, especially as she develops her psychic abilities in future books.",

His journey of learning vulnerability, love, asking for help, and authenticity was engaging.  \n   - However, the story glossed over the severe and ongoing abuse David endured from his father during childhood. This trauma was mentioned only in passing and never fully acknowledged or addressed, except for the symbolic removal of his father’s ghost, which felt insufficient.  \n\n- **Relationships (David and Moira):**  \n   - The platonic love between David and Moira was organic and beautifully portrayed. It was refreshing to see representation of a triad where one relationship is platonic, especially in a romance-adjacent space.  \n   - Their dynamic was a highlight, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves in future books.  \n\n- **Character Development (Rhys):**  \n   - Rhys was a challenging character for me. As the core of the triad, he ended up in romantic/sexual relationships with both David and Moira, which was intriguing.  \n   - However, his personality felt inconsistent—shifting between being a hyper-focused academic, a bitter ex-boyfriend, a doting husband, an insecure power player, and a morally rigid sorcerer.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**\n   - S.T. Gibson excels at creating gothic, atmospheric, and occult worlds that immediately draw the reader in. The setting of *Evocation* is bewitching and immersive, characteristic of Gibson's signature style.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters are the central focus of the story, with the plot taking a secondary role. David, a high-strung psychic child prodigy, Rhys, his hardworking and determined ex, and Moira, Rhys’ grounded and powerful wife, are all richly developed. Their dynamics, growth, and evolving relationships are compelling and form the heart of the narrative.\n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**\n   - The novel tackles complex themes such as the occult, deals with the devil, polyamory, and abuse. These elements are woven into the story in a way that feels organic and thought-provoking.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot revolves around David’s mysterious psychic illness, which draws Rhys and Moira into an investigation to save his life. While the plot is engaging, it serves more as a backdrop to the character-driven narrative. The pacing allows for deep exploration of the characters’ relationships and personal growth.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**\n   - Fans of *The Raven Boys* will likely enjoy *Evocation*, as it shares a similar focus on character dynamics and atmospheric storytelling.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**\n   - The reviewer was initially drawn to the book for its plot but stayed for the characters, becoming deeply invested in their journey. The evolving relationships, from antagonism to new dynamics, were particularly engaging and entertaining.\n\n- **Critique and Anticipation:**\n   - While there were a few bumps in the road, particularly regarding the portrayal of polyamory, the reviewer acknowledges their lack of expertise in this area and refrains from harsh judgment. They express excitement for the next book in the series, eager to see where the story takes David, Rhys, and Moira next.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evocation* by S.T. Gibson is a character-driven, atmospheric novel that delves into the occult, complex relationships, and personal growth. While the plot takes a backseat to the richly developed characters, the story is engaging and immersive, leaving the reader eager for the next installment in *The Summoner’s Circle* series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The story is primarily character-driven, with the occult and magical elements serving as a backdrop. While the fantasy aspects added an intriguing layer, the narrative could have easily unfolded in a more mundane setting, like a bakery. The issues seemed to resolve too conveniently by the end, which felt unrealistic. However, the elements I loved were strong enough to overshadow these concerns.",

Moira was a standout throughout the story, while Rhys, despite his best efforts, felt somewhat underdeveloped. The formation of the throuple felt incomplete, lacking key conversations and clearer communication, particularly regarding jealousy issues between Rhys and Moira.",

His development throughout the book is beautiful.  \n   - Moira was initially feared to be disliked but turned out to have a motherly quality. Despite some unfairness toward Rhys, she was liked.  \n   - Rhys defied initial expectations. He was expected to be insecure, soft, and fragile but turned out to be grounded, closed, and sometimes demanding. However, he remained the character I felt I knew the least about.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n   - The Devil serves as a tool to bring the emotional and relational complexities together.  \n   - The book sometimes jumps around, mentioning events that happened off-page, which left me wanting more context.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Relationships:**  \n   - The story is rich with emotional depth, tumult, and complexity.  \n   - The longing between David and Rhys was compelling, though at times, David and Moira's relationship felt more like a love story, despite not being romantic.  \n\n- **Pacing and Information Gaps:**  \n   - I needed more backstory about David and Rhys's past, as well as more details about the fight between Moira and Rhys (even though I am aware of the prequel).  \n   - The psychoanalytic aspect of the characters, especially David, was absolutely delicious and well-executed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite some gaps and imperfections, the book was highly enjoyable, particularly for its character-driven narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a deeply character-driven novel filled with emotional complexity and rich relationships. While I wished for more backstory and context in certain areas, the characters—especially David—were incredibly compelling. The psychoanalytic depth and emotional turmoil made the story a satisfying read, even if it wasn't perfect.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars."

            "The character interactions in this story are exceptional. I found myself equally invested in all three points of view, which is a rarity for me. Each character pair showcased a unique dynamic, and I was particularly fond of all three, including the married couple—typically a dynamic I don't enjoy, yet it was crafted beautifully here. The nuanced messiness of their relationships and the distinct ways they came together made the narrative especially engaging.",

In contrast, **Rhys** feels underdeveloped, leaving me with little connection to him. **David** is a complex and flawed character, which adds depth to his relationships and makes him compelling. The dynamics among the characters are intricate and engaging; while I wasn't particularly fond of Rhys and David's relationship, Moira and David's connection is beautifully portrayed and feels equally significant. The book also excels in diverse representation, featuring multiple poly characters, a bisexual male main character, a gay male character, a Black female main character, and various queer and POC side characters.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and World-Building:**  \n   - The book is beautifully written, with complex characters and relationships.  \n   - The pacing feels off in the beginning, as the story jumps in without much world-building or explanation of the magic system, which can be jarring. However, the pacing improves significantly as the book progresses.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The balance between character development and plot is well-executed. The characters are given depth without detracting from the overall plot.  \n   - **Moira:** She is the standout character, feeling very real and relatable. I would love to see more of her, especially as she embraces new aspects of her magic.  \n   - **Rhys:** His character felt lacking, and I didn’t feel a strong connection to him.  \n   - **David:** He is a complex and flawed character, which makes him compelling and realistic. His struggles with personal issues add depth to his relationships.  \n   - The relationships between the characters are intricate and interesting. While I wasn’t a fan of Rhys and David’s relationship, Moira and David’s relationship is beautifully portrayed and feels equally important.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n   - The book includes diverse representation: multiple poly characters, a bi male main character (mmc), a gay male main character, a Black female main character (fmc), and queer and POC side characters.  \n   - Themes such as alcoholism are addressed, adding layers to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a beautifully written novel with well-developed, complex characters and intricate relationships. While the pacing and world-building could be stronger at the start, the story improves as it progresses. The representation and themes are thoughtfully integrated, making the book both engaging and meaningful.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25⭐️"

            "The plot would have been enhanced by deeper flashbacks that explore the past relationship between David and Rhys. Additionally, the ending felt rushed and somewhat lackluster, as the antagonist lacked a significant presence throughout the story, leaving the final scenes feeling empty.",
            "The book is narrated from the perspectives of David, Rhys, and Moira. I found it challenging to connect with the main characters due to their lack of development. Moira stood out as my favorite; her deep love for Rhys drives her to support him as he comes to terms with his feelings for David. I appreciated her strength, particularly in not yielding to David. While the polyamorous relationship felt authentic in its progression, the conclusion seemed rushed. Both Moira and David's love for Rhys ultimately fosters a friendship between them.",
            "The story immerses readers in a captivating world of secret occult societies. Its urban gothic fantasy setting enriches the narrative, adding depth and intrigue.",

I like how she didn’t bow down to anyone, especially David.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot could have benefited from some deeper flashbacks that help to set up the past relationship with David and Rhys.\n   - The ending was a little lackluster and rushed. The bad “demon” really never had a presence in the book, so the ending scenes just felt empty.\n\n- **Relationships and Dynamics:**\n   - The polyamorous relationship was believable in how it was developed but definitely seems rushed in the end.\n   - Both Moira and David loved Rhys so much that they developed a friendship with each other.\n\n- **Narration and Audiobook Experience:**\n   - The audiobook, narrated by Oscar Reyes, was really well done!

            "The story and overall tone of the book differed significantly from my initial expectations based on the blurb. While this isn't necessarily a drawback, it did take me some time to adjust, which may have influenced my perspective. I anticipated more paranormal intrigue, with David's psychic side jobs and a spookier exploration of the ancestral deal with the devil. Although the deal and curse are central to the plot, they often felt more like background details than key elements, appearing in only a couple of scenes. Instead, the book reads more like an intimate slice of life, immersing the reader in the thoughts and emotions of the three main characters as they navigate shared experiences, such as secret society leadership and their complex relationships."

I couldn’t put it down and ended up finishing it in one day because I was so curious about how things would turn out for multiple aspects of the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The ending was acceptably satisfying, with most immediate peril somewhat tied up and no giant cliffhanger. However, there is certainly more story to explore in this world with these characters.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n   - The story and overall vibe of the book were quite different from what I was expecting based on my assumptions and the short description blurb. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it took some time for me to adjust and may have filtered my opinion in some ways.  \n   - I thought there would be more paranormal secret society shenanigans, more of David’s psychic side jobs, and more of the ancestral deal with the devil (with a spookier vibe). While the deal/curse is a major plot point, aside from maybe two scenes, it felt more like background trivia than a pivotal plot element.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n   - To me, the book read almost more like an intimate slice of life, where I was hanging out inside the minds of the three main characters as they went through shared main events (secret society leadership, ancestral deal/curse) and evaluated their feelings and relationships.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - While I wasn’t a big fan of any of the three main characters, I appreciated that they were all written to be very human and flawed. We get to see them wrestle with and face some of their flaws, which added depth to their development.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n   - The audiobook narration was excellent—well-paced, emotive (without being over-the-top), and easy to distinguish between the three main characters.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Evocation* was an engaging and interesting read, though it diverged from my initial expectations.

There is clear communication among all three, and they agree to try a new relationship by the end.  \n   - The book also includes other examples of non-monogamy, making it a common and valid representation of polyamory.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - The characters are well-developed, and their conflicts feel authentic.

Repairing his relationship with Rhys posed a significant challenge for him. I also appreciated that David’s sister and Lorena were more than just side characters; they were intriguing, and I would love to read a whole book about their backstories.

While the secret society played a significant role, the relationships between Moira, Rhys, and David were the main focus, along with David’s demon possession.  \n  - The themes of family trauma, found family, and morally grey characters were well-executed.  \n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  - I enjoyed the book overall, but I felt the final event could have been drawn out a bit more, though I understand it was already chaotic.  \n  - The emotional moments were impactful, and I got very attached to the characters despite the book being relatively short.  \n\n- **Representation and Tropes:**  \n  - The representation of BIPOC characters, a polyamorous relationship, and queer identities was refreshing and well-integrated.  \n  - Tropes like morally grey characters, exes to rivals to lovers, forced proximity, secret society, found family, and family trauma were skillfully woven into the narrative.  \n\n- **Author and Series Potential:**  \n  - This might be my second favorite book by S.T. Gibson. I really enjoyed it and can’t wait for the next books in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a dark, fun, and emotionally engaging novel with well-developed characters and relationships. While the ending felt slightly rushed, the story’s themes, representation, and tropes were executed brilliantly. I’m excited to see where the series goes next!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The characters' backgrounds are underdeveloped, making the story feel like a sequel or fanfic where the characters are already established. The relationships between Moira, David, and Rhys lack sufficient buildup, resulting in dynamics that feel unexplained and somewhat forced. The polyamorous relationship appears more as a narrative necessity than a natural evolution for the characters. This lack of well-defined backgrounds, particularly for Moira, undermines the plausibility of their interactions. While David, a wealthy lawyer and medium, may not be particularly likable, he remains a compelling character.",

Their dynamic adds depth to the story.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n   - The audio narrator did an excellent job bringing a sense of action and importance to the story, with good pacing.  \n   - The narrator handled the male main characters' voices well, but Moira's over-the-top Southern accent was occasionally distracting.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n   - The book effectively builds the world and introduces the magic system, though some aspects, like the society's magic workings and Moira's family magic, could have been explored further.  \n   - The demon drama was mentioned in other reviews as an area that could have been expanded, but I felt the focus on relationship-building was appropriate for this installment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - I found the book fun and enjoyable, with a strong foundation for future installments in the series.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was an enjoyable read with likable characters and solid world-building. While I wished for more depth in certain areas, such as the magic system and character backstories, the book successfully laid the groundwork for future developments in the series. The audiobook narration was engaging, though Moira's accent was occasionally overdone. Overall, I look forward to more installments in this series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The stakes in the story often felt too low, as characters remained overly relaxed about solving David's problem until it escalated to a life-threatening situation. While the resolution to the main conflict is intriguing and effectively sets up the narrative, the journey to reach that point lacked dynamic action, primarily consisting of reading and casting spells.",
            "David was initially difficult to warm up to, but he gradually became more likable. Although he never completely transcends his archetype, he becomes more bearable as the story progresses. Rhys was decent, though he could be annoying at times. My favorite character was definitely Moira, and I’m eager to see where her story goes.",
            "This book skillfully delves into the dynamics of flawed characters and their growth within a magical setting. It deviates from traditional fantasy, lacking exploration and unexpected twists, so readers should adjust their expectations accordingly."

            "I wished for a greater focus on the magical elements, which were overshadowed by other plot aspects. David's possession lacked the anticipated terror and felt somewhat glossed over, with the exception of the research components.",
            "The three perspectives in the story were amusingly stubborn, making for an entertaining read. Moira emerged as the voice of reason, remaining steadfast and authentic, and I found her the most relatable. Each character carries their own secrets and burdens, with David's being the most prominent. While David and Rhys were intriguing, it was Moira who truly captured my attention.",
            "Moira's journey of self-discovery is profoundly relatable. She grows weary of hiding and minimizing herself, yearning to spread her wings and explore her true potential.",
            "This book feels more personal than the previous two. While I enjoyed it, it wasn’t my favorite; that title still belongs to *An Education in Malice*. The tone and style of this book are wildly different from her earlier works.",
            "I'm eager to see where David, Rhys, and Moira's story leads next. With their conflicts mostly resolved and dynamics established, I anticipate the narrative will grow increasingly darker, more dangerous, and more intriguing.",

        "conclusion": "While this book didn’t surpass *An Education in Malice* as my favorite, it offered a deeply personal and unique experience compared to the author's earlier works.

Despite some underdeveloped magical elements, the book’s themes and character dynamics make it a worthwhile read for fans of dark fantasy and the occult.",

She wanted to unfurl her wings and see how far she could fly.\"*  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n   - I’m excited to see where David, Rhys, and Moira’s story goes next.  \n   - I imagine the story will become progressively darker, more dangerous, and more intriguing as the characters have (mostly) resolved their conflicts and established their dynamics.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience:**  \n   - I would recommend this book to fans of S.T.

I had no issue with his narration of multiple characters, including a female.\n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  David is a Boston lawyer with a knack for the occult. He moonlights as a psychic medium, performing seances for a secret society. As David nears his 30th birthday, he begins to realize his days may be numbered. He also recalls a hushed fairytale told down his ancestral line about a soul-selling deal made with the devil.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I thought the characters were interesting with a lot more than just their surface connections. There’s a depth of dark devotion, spice, and sadness to the trio’s relationship. Their emotional connection was complicated due to the exes/rivals/lovers link between David and Rhys and the empathic connection between Moira and David. I really enjoyed the banter between Moira and Rhys regarding her crystals.\n\n- **Themes and World-Building:**  \n  I enjoyed the incorporation of crystals, birth charts, tarot, and mediumship, as well as scrying, channeling, and seances in the book. The shared education between the couples and their use of these practices throughout was fascinating to read. The dynamic of good and evil and the power of love kept me engaged and made me continue reading the first book in *The Summoners Circle* series.\n\n- **Overall Impression:**  \n  I’m curious to see what happens next, and this was my first ST Gibson book. Thank you to the author and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel combines a compelling plot, rich character dynamics, and immersive occult themes, making it a captivating read. The narration was excellent, and the story left me eager to explore more of the series and the author’s work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Instead, it feels more like a cold affliction than a life-threatening curse. The urgency to resolve David's plight only intensifies toward the end, creating a disconnect with the overall stakes of the narrative.",

I enjoyed seeing him grow, especially since he’s someone who never asks for help but now finds himself in need of it. Rhys, another key character, is married to Moira and wants to help David without jeopardizing his marriage.

Revising the synopsis to withhold this detail could help maintain reader interest.",

The dialogues, particularly those between Moira and David, are rich with irony, adding depth to their interactions. However, the toxic relationship between Rhys and David could be problematic without a clear resolution or deeper exploration of its implications. One of the novel's greatest strengths is its inclusive representation of diverse relationships and sexualities, offering a modern perspective that resonates with a wide audience. While Rhys and David are well-developed, Moira's character lacks the same depth, which is a noticeable weakness in an otherwise strong ensemble."

While part of this was due to my current dopamine fast, I still chose to stick with this book over others, which speaks to its engaging nature.\n\n- **Genre Expectations and Themes:**  \n  If you’re expecting intrigue or mystery, this book might disappoint. The main focus is on the characters and their relationships. It’s heavy on romantic angst, so if that’s not your thing, this might not be for you. Personally, I enjoyed the romantic angst.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters were well-developed, and I loved their dynamics. However, there were moments when I wanted to smack them upside the head (in a fun way). Their relationships felt authentic and compelling.\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics:**  \n  As a social worker, I appreciated how the book addressed alcoholism. It was handled with care and depth, and there were moments that genuinely moved me.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The book explores queer, polyamorous love in a meaningful way. While I wouldn’t call it profound, it has a lot to say about these themes, and I appreciated the representation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed my time with this book. It’s a good read, especially if you’re drawn to character-driven stories with romantic angst and thoughtful exploration of relationships and sensitive topics.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  - The novel is a gothic, dark academia, paranormal romance with a rich blend of themes, including polyamory, rivals-to-lovers, LGBTQIA representation, the occult, tarot, and astrology.  \n  - It departs from the author’s previous vampire retellings, offering a fresh and unique narrative.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  - The story revolves around a trio of magicians who must work together, albeit reluctantly, to exorcise a demon that is consuming one of them from within through possession.  \n  - The central conflict involves exes Rhys and David, who must pool their magical talents to save David’s life, with the help of Rhys’s wife, Moira.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  - The relationships among the characters are sweet and rooted in love and companionship rather than lust, which I found endearing.  \n  - The dynamic between Rhys, David, and Moira is compelling, blending tension, cooperation, and emotional depth.  \n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The men-only magic fraternity evokes vibes reminiscent of *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, with a strong focus on political undertones surrounding the recognition of women as magicians and their inclusion in the magical circle.  \n  - The gothic and dark academia atmosphere is immersive and well-executed.  \n\n- **Representation and Inclusivity:**  \n  - The book excels in representation, featuring polyamory, LGBTQIA characters, and a diverse cast that feels authentic and meaningful.  \n\n- **Pacing and Writing Style:**  \n  - The pacing keeps the reader engaged, balancing action, emotional moments, and world-building effectively.  \n  - The writing style is polished and aligns well with the gothic and academic tone of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout addition to S.T. Gibson’s body of work, offering a fresh and inclusive take on gothic, dark academia, and paranormal romance. With its compelling characters, rich themes, and immersive world-building, it’s a story that resonates deeply. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am grateful to Angry Robot Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I’m captivated by David and Moira's relationship, which is so well-developed that it highlights the shortcomings of Rhys's character and his connections with both Moira and David. Despite being the primary romantic interest, Rhys feels underdeveloped and his storyline comes across as rushed and superficial.",

The way Gibson wove in elements of Tarot, fortune telling, and other forms of divinity as a normal aspect of urban society was fantastic to me. The magic system was on point!  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing**  \n   - The overall writing was good, and the plot was set at a solid, medium pace.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth**  \n   - The themes were well developed, especially in regard to childhood trauma and the impact it can have on both romantic and platonic relationships. I loved the portrayal of addiction! That was so well done!  \n\n- **Character Development**  \n   - I’m obsessed with David and his relationship with Moira. This friendship was so well developed that it ended up illuminating the underdevelopment of the character Rhys and the relationships that both Moira and David had with him. Everything with Rhys felt surface level and rushed, even though he’s the only one who is really a romantic interest.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building**  \n   - The atmosphere was lacking. I wanted to feel fully immersed in the world, like how we did in *A Dowry of Blood* and *An Education of Malice*, but we don’t quite have that here, unfortunately.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed *Evocation*.

I also enjoyed the sweet, platonic love shared between Moira and David, particularly how their magic complements one another. The Exes to Rivals to Lovers trope is my favorite take on second-chance romance, and it’s executed beautifully here.

I don't know if all the author's stories are heavily character-driven, but if they are, I'm happy to keep reading more from her.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - David, Rhys, and Moira were complex individuals navigating difficult situations and entangled relationships, all set against a backdrop of magic.  \n  - The character dynamics are the bread and butter of this story. They all clearly have a past with each other, either directly or from the sidelines, and learning about them and seeing them navigate through this almost forced proximity was delightful.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  - The author is either very knowledgeable or clearly did her research on the different types of magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. Every time magic appeared on the page, it felt robust and, especially from Rhys' perspective, academic. I loved that. It made the world feel fun and very much lived in.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  - The beginning was a little slow, but once the main trio was established, it was hard to put the book down.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Future Interest:**  \n  - I’m happy to pick up both the prequel and the next books!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by S.T.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Aesthetic and Physical Appeal:**  \n   - This is by far the most beautiful book I own.  \n\n- **Story Enjoyment and Style:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the story, although it was more introspective and character-driven than plot-driven than I thought it would be.  \n   - Overall, it was a fun read, but I would probably have liked a little more to happen in the plot. However, it was more about the characters than the plot, so that's just my personal taste.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - All of the characters are very well written.  \n   - I've heard some reviews saying that the character of Miora falls into the 'girl-boss' stereotype, but I'd have to disagree. She's a strong female character who is strong in her femininity, with her own complex narrative alongside the two male protagonists.  \n\n- **Writing Quality and Ending:**  \n   - The last chapter came off a little bit like an a03 fic (a very good a03 fic!), but I won't hold that against the rest of the book. Apart from the last chapter, it is very well-written.  \n   - I love S.T. Gibson and won't hold this against her—maybe just blame the editors.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully crafted, character-driven story with well-developed characters, particularly the strong and nuanced portrayal of Miora. While the plot could have been more eventful, the introspective nature of the story and its focus on character dynamics make it an enjoyable read. The writing is strong overall, though the final chapter felt slightly out of place.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Moira truly shines in this story; her unwavering support for her loved ones is admirable, and while she would go to great lengths for them, she also knows how to set boundaries for her own well-being. I expected to like Rhys more, but a particular piece of dialogue at the end diminished my enjoyment and cost the story half a star.

Both share similar elements, such as urban fantasy settings, occult/magical societies and rituals, and queer main characters. However, I found that this book delivered more of what I enjoyed in *Even Though I Knew The End*—magic existing in the mundane, unholy deals with demons and their consequences, and magical society drama.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I really liked how David grew and changed throughout the story. Rhys also showed some development, though not as much. Moira, on the other hand, felt like she could have had more depth and growth. While she did grow stronger as a medium, I wanted her character to be more fully realized. That said, since this was primarily David’s story, it makes sense that he underwent the most significant transformation.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Development:**  \n  I’m hopeful that Moira and Rhys will receive more development in future books, so I’ll hold off on further criticism for now.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I absolutely loved this book! It delivered on the elements I enjoy in urban fantasy, and David’s growth as a character was particularly compelling. While I wished for more depth in Moira’s character, the story left me eager to see where the series goes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I have high expectations for her work, and I look forward to more books by her.  \n\n- **Genre and Personal Preferences:**  \n  I’m not a fan of polyamory or MM romances, so the book wasn’t my cup of tea. If I had known what the book was about before buying it, I probably wouldn’t have purchased it.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  As always, I love ST Gibson’s style of writing—it’s fun and easy to read.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t find the characters very likable at the beginning, but as the story progressed, so did their development.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The storyline itself was very nice and clear. It made for a light, fun read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book wasn’t aligned with my personal preferences due to its themes, I still enjoyed ST Gibson’s writing style and the clear, engaging storyline.

            "The book struggles with its structure, as much of the narrative revolves around characters engaging in dialogue rather than action. While the action scenes, like the possession and the haunted house, were well-executed, they felt insufficient and arrived too late in the story. The plot surrounding Daniel's impending possession lacked urgency, and the Aristarkhov curse failed to instill a sense of dread. Additionally, there was a noticeable absence of on-page magic, missing opportunities for compelling scenes such as Daniel conducting seances, Rhys confronting a demon, or Moira interacting with a ghost.",
            "The character work in this story is exceptional, with Daniel, Moira, and Rhys portrayed as both sympathetic and frustrating, adding depth to their complexity. Moira, despite occasionally fitting into stereotypical roles, possesses a compelling voice, especially when she contemplates claiming power for herself. The romances are well-crafted, though the author appears to favor the M/M dynamics. The unconventional relationships, particularly between David and Moira, stand out as the most developed and enjoyable.",

The blurb further heightened my excitement, and I was thrilled when I received an invitation to read an advanced copy.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The story follows David as he grapples with a demonic curse that has plagued his family for decades. After his father’s death, David seeks help from Rhys, his ex-lover, who has his own struggles, including unresolved feelings for David. The introduction of Moira, who possesses a unique gift, adds another layer to the story, as her abilities might hold the key to solving David’s curse.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The relationships between David, Rhys, and Moira are the highlight of the book. Rhys’s kindness and Moira’s gentleness help David confront his family’s curse and become more himself. The intimacy David shares with both characters, though different in nature, is equally intense and beautifully portrayed.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Balance:**  \n  While I enjoyed the romance, there were moments when I wished for more focus on it rather than the demon-hunting plotline. However, the two elements are intertwined and necessary for the story’s progression. The tension created by David’s headaches and the demon’s influence kept me turning the pages eagerly.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  The ending was unexpected but made sense, especially since the book is part of a series. I’m eagerly anticipating the next installment and hope it won’t be too long before it’s released.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed this book and am excited for the sequel. It’s a fantastic choice for fans of queer romantasy set against a supernatural backdrop, with compelling characters and a well-balanced mix of romance and action.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book serves primarily as exposition to establish the narrative, which is typical for a first installment. However, it often feels overloaded with details while lacking significant action. The focus is more on character dynamics than on advancing a central plot.",
            "The exploration of the polyamorous relationship between David, Rhys, and Moira is a compelling aspect of the story. David and Rhys, exes and rivals within their secret occult society, navigate complex emotions when David's sudden \"spirit sickness\" forces them back together. Rhys, now married to Moira, whom he adores and views as a goddess, struggles with the toxicity of his past with David, while Moira seeks to protect him. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic between David and Moira, which added tension to the narrative. David stands out as an engaging character, and I am invested in his journey.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the intricate magic system, and the anticipation built throughout the story. I’m eagerly looking forward to reading more about these characters in the next books of the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.  \n\n*eARC received from Angry Robot, all opinions are my own.*"

Gibson’s reputation as a writer of occult and unconventional relationships. However, I was surprised by the mixed reviews and now understand why.  \n\n- **Ambition and Execution:**  \n   - The story is incredibly ambitious, exploring an ancestral demonic curse tied to David’s family line while also building and exploring three complex relationships.  \n   - The balance between these elements feels off, as the book seems to bite off more than it can chew.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n   - The book attempts to build a second-chance romance between David and Rhys, explore the emotional core of Rhys and Moira’s marriage, and develop a friendship and emotionally intimate relationship between Moira and David.  \n   - The relationship between Moira and David, which lacked sexual intimacy, was the most believable and well-developed, adding significant value to both characters.  \n   - The exploration of polyamorous relationships and their complexities was interesting, though challenging to execute.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - David was my favorite character, as I have a soft spot for snarky, vulnerable individuals.  \n\n- **World-Building and Occult Elements:**  \n   - I loved the magic and occult elements in this world.  \n   - As this appears to be the first book in a series, I’m excited to see how future installments build on the potential of the world, characters, and relationships.  \n\n- **Gratitude:**  \n   - Thank you to NetGalley and Angry Robot for granting my wish and allowing me to read this ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book is ambitious and tackles complex themes, it struggles to balance its multiple storylines and relationships effectively. Despite this, the world-building, occult elements, and certain character dynamics (particularly Moira and David’s relationship) stand out. I look forward to seeing how the series develops in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars rounded down."

I craved a deeper exploration of his family’s curse and his relationship with the demon. While Moira was likable, her frequent use of “y’all” and exaggerated Southern twang made her feel more like a caricature. Rhys, on the other hand, was lifeless and lacked chemistry with David, making their connection feel underwhelming. In contrast, Moira and David shared more chemistry, which weakened the central romance. The ensemble of David, Moira, and Rhys didn’t blend seamlessly, detracting from the overall story.

The novel's central conflict failed to convey the urgency and gravity needed to make it truly compelling, leaving it underwhelming.",
            "In this book, the characters spend much of their time on side quests, even as the looming threat of demonic possession complicates their relationship. While the polyamorous dynamics and romantic tension are skillfully portrayed, the focus on these side quests detracts from the central conflict.

            "The plot felt rushed and underdeveloped, particularly in the final fifth of the book, where the main objective of breaking a curse seemed to be overlooked. Despite the author’s acknowledgment of a seven-year development process, the story ultimately came across as half-baked.",
            "While the characters may not be particularly likable, the dynamic among the three main characters—David, Moira, and Rhys—is compelling. The representation of non-monogamy is skillfully handled, steering clear of common pitfalls like unicorn hunting. David, a gay man, shares a unique, non-sexual attraction to Moira, adding depth to their relationship. Additionally, the power dynamics between the wealthy David and the humble Rhys are thoughtfully crafted, avoiding the typical imbalances often found in such narratives.",
            "The writing exhibited inconsistencies, particularly regarding David's profession, which fluctuated between being a prosecutor and working for a firm. Additionally, the book's tone and themes leaned towards a middle-class, affluent perspective, emphasizing entrepreneurship and social status.",
            "The Secret Society comes across as generic and lacks a clear purpose, resembling more of a local chamber of commerce or a junior senator's role than a powerful, enigmatic organization. Its rules are inconsistent—allowing a trans man while prohibiting women—as its conservative stance conflicts with the election of Rhys as High Priest. The ethical and political implications of the Society remain murky, obscuring the characters' motivations and values.",
            "The book's exploration of politics and ethics is inconsistent, particularly concerning wealth and power. While it highlights status symbols—such as David gifting Moira a Gucci fur coat—and embraces a liberal feminist, girlboss vibe, the narrative fails to clearly address issues of wealth inequality and power dynamics."

        "conclusion": "This novel was a mixed bag, with underdeveloped plot elements, inconsistent world-building, and murky political themes. However, the well-crafted non-monogamy representation and compelling character dynamics made it an enjoyable read overall. The potential for future stories, particularly with Leda's narrative, adds intrigue and may warrant further exploration.",

This felt unsatisfying and undermined the potential of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Substance:**  \n  The novel prioritized vibes over substance, resulting in a story that felt shallow and unfulfilled. It had significant potential but failed to deliver on its promises.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Evocation* was a disappointing read due to its flat characters, lack of chemistry, weightless stakes, and unsatisfying resolution. While it had potential, the story ultimately fell short, relying on vibes rather than meaningful substance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5"

The possessions themselves are often glossed over, lacking significant consequences until the plot reaches its climax. Additionally, the characters appear unprepared for the gravity of David's condition, despite their prior knowledge, which feels inconsistent.",

Moira and David's relationship was especially poignant, highlighting a unique and loving bond despite David's lack of romantic attraction to her. The characters were well-developed, though perhaps excessively so for a 300-page book, necessitating considerable emotional unpacking. Moira emerged as a standout character—iconic and flawless.",
            "The book was marketed as an occult urban fantasy centered on demonic possession and a life-threatening contract, but it ultimately prioritized romance, relegating the urban fantasy and occult elements to mere subplots. This misrepresentation disappointed readers hoping for a more plot-driven narrative. The occult aspects lacked focus and depth, with the characters' rituals feeling poorly constructed and insignificant to the overall story."

His intricate and irritable nature, coupled with a compelling family history, made him my favorite character, leaving me eager to learn more about his past. Moira, another significant character, was a close second; her ability to put others at ease and her dynamic with David were standout elements of the story. However, the romance felt less engaging. While one character's feelings were evident, the lack of reciprocation and chemistry diminished my enjoyment of the subplot. The interactions often came across as toxic, which further detracted from the romance. Despite this, I remain invested in the characters and look forward to reading the second book to see how their relationships evolve.",

He was my favorite character, and I found myself constantly wanting to learn more about his background.\n   - Moira, another key character, was a close second favorite. Her ability to make others feel at ease and her dynamic with David were highlights of the book.\n\n- **Queer Representation and Themes:**\n   - The novel features queer representation, which is woven naturally into the story.\n   - The relationships between the characters, including the polyamorous \"V\" dynamic, add depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building is both easy to grasp and fascinating. Elements like scrying, horoscopes, and demons are intriguing and well-integrated into the story.\n   - The setting of a secret society and dark academia adds an engaging layer to the novel.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Gibson’s writing in *Evocation* is more accessible compared to her previous work, *A Dowry of Blood*, which was known for its purple prose. This change makes the book easier to read and more approachable.\n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**\n   - The romance aspect of the story was less compelling for me. While it was clear that one character was in love with another, the feelings didn’t feel reciprocated, and the chemistry between them was lacking.\n   - The interactions between the characters often felt toxic, which detracted from my enjoyment of the romantic subplot.\n   - Despite this, I am invested enough in the characters to want to read the second book and see how their relationships develop.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The novel is more character-driven than plot-driven, focusing on the emotional and interpersonal dynamics of the characters.\n   - If you enjoy books that prioritize vibes and atmosphere over a fast-paced plot, you’ll likely appreciate *Evocation*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Evocation* is a character-driven novel with strong queer representation, fascinating world-building, and complex, well-developed characters. While the romance fell short for me due to a lack of chemistry and toxic interactions, the overall story and characters kept me engaged. I’m eager to see how the relationships evolve in the next installment.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n3.5 ✰"

            "The book concluded on a high note, with the final 25% featuring significant sacrifices and dramatic actions that truly conveyed the stakes and deepened my connection to the characters and their relationships. The blend of mystical magic and paranormal elements was engaging, and the ending piqued my curiosity for the next installment.",
            "I adored the relationship between Rhys and Moira; it truly exemplified marriage goals. However, the development of David's feelings felt rushed and unexpected. While I appreciate the emphasis on emotional over physical attraction in the polyamorous dynamic, it didn't resonate with me. Although the novel is character-driven, I found it challenging to connect with the characters. The multi-POV narration offers a nuanced view of the complex dynamics among David, Rhys, and Moira, but ultimately lacks depth for each character. Despite their intense emotions propelling the narrative, I felt emotionally distanced and struggled to fully understand their personalities and motivations.",
            "The author establishes an engrossing tone from the very first chapter, crafting an immersive atmosphere that captivates the reader. The story is steeped in a mystical intrigue and a sense of impending dread, making it all too easy to keep turning the pages. Its \"just one more chapter\" quality is a notable strength. *Evocation* offers a bold and refreshingly diverse perspective on the paranormal fantasy genre—modern, queer, and delightfully messy in both good and less favorable ways. While it may not have fully met my (perhaps unreasonably high) expectations, I still admire it for its ambition and evocative atmosphere."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Evocation is a diabolically fun and unapologetically messy urban fantasy with a strong atmosphere and intriguing mystical elements. While the character development and romance didn’t fully resonate with me, the story’s boldness, diversity, and satisfying ending make it worth a read for fans of character-driven, modern, and queer fantasy.",

            "The story felt overloaded with elements: the curse, priesthood, Rhys and David’s relationship, the triad setup, and David’s alcoholism, which made the plot overwhelming and unfocused. The ending was rushed and left me unsatisfied; after all the buildup, the resolution felt abrupt, especially regarding Rhys’s fate at 30. Although the book was heavily marketed as a triad, this dynamic only emerged in the final chapter, primarily due to Moira’s intervention. The relationships were imbalanced, with a strong Moira-David connection and a weaker Rhys-Moira bond, making the triad feel incomplete. Moira’s potential to explore other partners or deepen her relationship with Rhys was underutilized. Many plot threads remained unresolved, and the resolutions for both the triad and the curse lacked the depth they deserved. Despite these frustrations, I enjoyed aspects of the book, particularly Rhys and David’s relationship. Ultimately, the story would have benefited from being split into two books or having a more focused plot.",

I appreciated how they supported each other, with David sharing his struggles about his father and Moira expressing her fears. \n\n**Rhys and David:** Their dynamic was intense and captivating. As former friends and lovers, they had a compelling love-hate relationship reminiscent of one of my favorite pairings, Fox and Brandt. Despite their conflicts, they were irresistibly drawn to each other, and their chemistry was palpable.\n\n**Rhys and Moira:** This relationship felt underdeveloped. While they loved and defended one another, their connection lacked the depth and passion found in the other two relationships.

Although the author demonstrated a solid understanding of Moira's astrology and mediumship, the darker magic felt underdeveloped, serving more as a setup for a sequel. The demon possession plotline was particularly disappointing; David's affliction resembled a magical version of COVID rather than a centuries-old curse. Additionally, there was a lack of meaningful interaction with the demon or its manifestations.",

            "The characters in the story were intriguing but lacked sufficient development. My favorite aspect was the friendship between Moira and David in the latter half of the book. However, Rhys felt like a weak link; he came across as a poor husband to Moira and a bad friend to David. The polyamorous dynamics were fraught with toxicity and jealousy until the final chapters. Rhys and Moira's monogamous relationship was strained, as Rhys constantly grappled with his feelings for David, often holding back from physical intimacy. His emotional affair with David overshadowed his marriage, making the eventual shift to polyamory feel one-sided and unfair to Moira. Additionally, Rhys treated David as an afterthought, particularly during critical moments, such as when David was dying.",

The characters lacked proper development, the romantic relationships felt toxic and unbalanced, and the magic system was underexplored. The highlight was Moira and David's friendship, but Rhys's presence detracted from the story. Overall, the book left me frustrated and disappointed.",

Not knowing this beforehand made the beginning of *Evocation* confusing.\n   - The prequel also revealed Moira’s biphobia, which contradicts her actions in *Evocation* (trying to bring Rhys and David together). The author has since announced a rewrite of the prequel to fix these inconsistencies, so I’m choosing to ignore it for now.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot was mostly relationship drama with minimal magic. The demonic possession storyline was barely addressed until the end, and there was no sense of urgency, even when David’s life was at stake.\n   - David’s possession felt like an afterthought, with little progression or tension. The characters spent months researching but made no progress, and David’s reaction to his impending doom was absurd.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Chemistry:**\n   - The romance was underwhelming. I didn’t feel any chemistry between Rhys and David, especially since David came across as arrogant and unlikeable for most of the book.\n   - The relationship between Rhys, David, and Moira had some nice moments, but they weren’t enough to salvage the overall lack of connection.\n   - Moira started off as a likable character but became frustrating as the story progressed.\n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**\n   - The dialogue was often cringe-worthy, especially when it felt like the author was using it to educate readers on polyamory.\n   - Much of the book read like fanfiction, with characters acting more like teenagers than adults in their mid-to-late twenties.\n\n- **Maturity and Genre Labeling:**\n   - Despite being labeled as Adult, the book felt more like YA in terms of maturity and tone. The few spicy scenes were lackluster compared to some YA novels I’ve read.\n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**\n   - The magic system was interesting but underutilized. It seemed well-researched, but it was only mentioned or used sparingly.\n\n- **Ending:**\n   - The ending was unsatisfying and felt rushed. It seemed like the author didn’t know how to resolve David’s possession storyline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile *Evocation* wasn’t the worst book I’ve ever read, it didn’t meet my expectations.

            "The novel is deeply character-driven, centering on the relationships between David, Rhys, and Moira. However, the focus on Rhys in \"Polyamorous V\" feels unwarranted by the end. While David and Moira share remarkable chemistry, it remains non-romantic, and Moira often feels underutilized, primarily serving to facilitate the romantic reunion between Rhys and David after infidelity.",

However, as the story unfolds, the emphasis on mysticism diminishes, and new practices like Chaos Magic are introduced without adequate exploration. The central conflict surrounding the Aristarkhov deal is vaguely defined and lacks urgency until the conclusion, which undermines the overall immersion."

However, this central conflict is not tackled until about 75% of the way through the book. Instead, much of the narrative focuses on rebuilding and deepening the characters' relationships, rather than advancing the plot.",
            "David starts as an arrogant, perfectionist, and self-absorbed character, but his incredible development transforms him into someone you ultimately love. Rhys, a hardworking and endearing assistant librarian, embodies perseverance and sweetness. Moira, a kind and open-minded medium, stands out with her unique quirks. While Rhys and Moira make a charming couple, the introduction of a potential romance between Rhys and David complicates their dynamic. Moira’s jealousy and the love triangle feel uneven and confusing, especially with the use of familial terms like “brothers” alongside romantic intentions, which creates an uncomfortable tension.",

Initially unlikable, he becomes a character you love by the end.\n   - Rhys: A hardworking, sweet, and lovable assistant librarian with a strong sense of perseverance.\n   - Moira: A kind, warm, and open-minded medium with unique quirks that make her stand out.\n\n- **Plot:**\n   - The main plot revolves around the three main characters (David, Rhys, and Moira) putting aside their differences to cast out a demon from David. However, this central conflict is only addressed around 75% into the book.\n   - The majority of the book focuses on rebuilding and developing the relationships between the characters rather than advancing the plot.\n\n- **Humor:**\n   - The book contains dry humor, particularly through David’s dialogue. Some moments require re-reading to fully grasp the intended humor due to David’s serious demeanor.\n\n- **Romance:**\n   - Rhys and Moira are portrayed as a sweet couple, but the introduction of a potential romance between Rhys and David complicates the dynamic. Moira’s jealousy and the love triangle feel uneven and confusing.\n   - The use of familial terms like “brothers” alongside romantic intentions creates an uncomfortable dynamic.\n\n- **Magic System:**\n   - The magic system is classic occult-based, involving summoning and chanting, fitting for a modern setting. However, it doesn’t stand out as particularly unique or memorable.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Vibes:**\n   - The book lacks a strong atmospheric or immersive quality, leaving the reader with little to hold onto beyond the characters’ emotions.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - The book is enjoyable for its strong character development and humor but falls short in terms of plot and atmosphere. It’s a mixed experience, leaving the reader conflicted about their feelings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book is a mixed bag, offering strong character development and dry humor but lacking a compelling plot and atmospheric depth. While the characters are well-crafted and engaging, the uneven romance and minimal plot progression make it a less satisfying read overall. It may appeal to readers who prioritize character-driven stories over plot-heavy narratives.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n★ ★ 2.75 stars"

            "The pacing of the story falters, particularly in the final 80 pages, which rush toward the climactic event at the expense of deeper explorations of rituals, relationship histories, and the central David-Rhys conflict. While the first 100 pages offer engaging insights into the characters, magic, and ambitions, this depth is lost midway through in favor of a hurried reveal of the main antagonist and polyamorous dynamics. Ultimately, the book suffers from the common pitfalls of a first installment in a series, leaving many intriguing elements underdeveloped.",
            "The portrayal of the polyamorous relationship is poorly executed, marked by sloppy negotiations and unclear dynamics. There is minimal discussion of feelings, particularly between the married couple, Rhys and Moira. Their marriage lacks authenticity, characterized by stilted interactions, childish pettiness, and exaggerated displays of emotion, resulting in a relationship that feels shallow and unconvincing. David's character is underdeveloped and requires therapy before engaging in any romantic involvement; his unresolved issues—such as childhood abuse, alcoholism, and feelings of inadequacy—are conveniently overlooked for the sake of the plot. In contrast, Moira and David's friendship stands out as the only genuine connection in the book, showcasing a realistic and gradual development of mutual understanding. However, Rhys' treatment of David is inconsistent and often harsh, rendering his professed love for David unearned and unconvincing.",
            "The writing style is engaging and easy to read, with well-crafted sentence structures. However, the story's content and execution do not meet expectations.",
            "The universe is intriguing, but the magical systems and rituals are underutilized. While the book hints at fascinating magic, it prioritizes the throuple's arguments over exploring these elements. As a result, the magical plot points feel underdeveloped and fail to fully engage me."

        "conclusion": "While the book has some intriguing magical elements and a promising universe, it is ultimately let down by poor pacing, underdeveloped relationships, and rushed character arcs. The polyamorous dynamic feels unconvincing, and the characters lack the depth and believability seen in earlier works. Despite the enjoyable writing style, the story fails to deliver a satisfying narrative, making it a disappointing read overall.",

There’s very little discussion of feelings, especially between the married couple, Rhys and Moira.\n   - Rhys and Moira’s marriage feels unconvincing, with stilted interactions, childish pettiness, and overly demonstrative moments. Their relationship lacks depth and believability.\n   - David’s character is underdeveloped and in need of therapy before entering any romantic relationship. His unresolved issues (childhood abuse, alcoholism, inadequacy) are glossed over for plot convenience.\n   - Moira and David’s friendship is the only genuine, unhurried connection in the book, offering a realistic and gradual development of mutual understanding.\n   - Rhys’ treatment of David is inconsistent and often harsh, making his proclaimed love for David feel unearned and unconvincing.\n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**\n   - The universe is interesting, but the magical systems and rituals are underutilized. The book teases cool magic but focuses too much on the throuple’s arguments instead of exploring these elements.\n   - The magical plot points feel half-assed and fail to engage the reader fully.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - Gibson’s writing style is easy to read and enjoyable, with well-crafted sentence structures. However, the content and execution of the story fall short of expectations.\n\n- **Comparison to Previous Works:**\n   - This book is a disappointment compared to Gibson’s previous works, *ADoB* and *AEiM*, which handled polyamory, abuse, and relationship conflicts with care and depth.\n   - The portrayal of toxic relationships in this book feels rushed and less believable than in Gibson’s standalone novels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book has some intriguing magical elements and a promising universe, it is ultimately let down by poor pacing, underdeveloped relationships, and rushed character arcs. The polyamorous dynamic feels unconvincing, and the characters lack the depth and believability seen in Gibson’s previous works. Despite the enjoyable writing style, the story fails to deliver a satisfying narrative, making it a disappointing read overall.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific numerical rating is mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a low-to-moderate score due to the significant flaws highlighted."

His portrayal is unpleasant and overbearing, making it hard to connect with or appreciate him. The throuple dynamic involving Moira, Rhys, and David feels unnecessary and poorly executed.

Overall, the chemistry among the three characters is lacking and feels forced throughout the book."

The resolution of the main plot is illogical and unravels under scrutiny. The story resembles a fanfic, where character dynamics overshadow the plot, making it unsatisfying for a full-length novel. Additionally, the book contains grammatical errors and inconsistencies, such as Moira’s name being misspelled in a chapter heading. David’s age is inconsistently stated, with a two-year discrepancy that undermines a key plot point.",
            "Moira is portrayed as a flawless, angelic character, which renders her unrealistic and one-dimensional. Her representation as a Black woman from the South may raise concerns, though I encourage other readers to share their perspectives on this aspect. Despite her independence, she primarily dedicates her time to supporting two deeply flawed men, which diminishes her agency. Rhys's characterization is inconsistent; his actions contradict the narrative's depiction of him as kind, sensitive, and progressive. He mistreats his wife and David, lies, and manipulates others, yet the story attempts to justify his behavior. His controlling nature is the only consistently portrayed trait, making him unlikable and poorly developed.",

The narrative includes superfluous details meant to highlight the characters' \"unproblematic\" traits, like Rhys being a \"#wifeguy\" who champions inclusivity, yet these qualities are not evident in their actions. Additionally, Rhys's ability to alter societal rules presents a plot hole; he could have used this power to assist his wife but chose not to.",

It could easily be substituted with a college fraternity without affecting the story's impact. Additionally, the magic system is poorly explained, rendering its presence unnecessary. The protagonist, a devout Catholic, joining a demon-summoning occult society as a young adult strains credibility and undermines believability."

Why choose a career in law? These aspects feel underdeveloped and lack meaningful justification. The reactions of Moira and Rhys upon learning about David's abusive past are equally troubling; his mention of losing a tooth due to an incident is met with indifference. This emotional detachment exemplifies the book's overarching issues—everything feels superficial and unconvincing.\n\nMoreover, the animosity Moira and Rhys harbor towards David before the story begins seems unwarranted. Their intense dislike appears to stem from a self-published novella from five years ago, which is no longer available. The details provided do not clarify their resentment—are they simply upset because he is wealthy and somewhat rude? Rhys's treatment of David, especially during his alcohol relapse, is particularly harsh. Despite knowing David is in recovery, Rhys fails to warn him about a job opportunity at an event with free alcohol, which feels cruel and inconsistent with someone who claims to care for him.\n\nThe narrative's insistence that David never asks for help, followed by characters rolling their eyes or contemplating abandoning him when he does, is frustrating. This internal inconsistency in how characters treat David undermines the authenticity of their relationships, leaving the reader with a sense of disconnection.",

The details provided don’t explain their intense dislike—is it just because he’s rich and a little rude?  \n   - Rhys’s treatment of David, particularly during David’s alcohol relapse, was awful. Rhys knew David was in recovery but didn’t warn him about taking the job David wanted, even though it happened at an event with free alcohol.

The internal inconsistency in how characters treated David was jarring and made their relationships feel unrealistic.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Logic:**  \n   - The plot points at the end, especially regarding the demon and characters withholding crucial information, felt contrived. If someone I’d raised was nearing their thirtieth birthday with no heirs and I suspected a demon might come to collect, I’d check on them, even if they’d isolated themselves. The lack of logic in character actions was endlessly frustrating.  \n   - The plot twists were predictable and obvious from a distance, which made the story feel less engaging.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Magic System:**  \n   - The worldbuilding was nonexistent. The society’s purpose and rules were never explained, making it hard to understand why characters acted the way they did. For example, why can Rhys practice rituals if he doesn’t have magic? What are the risks of doing magic? These questions were never addressed.  \n   - The demon contract raised more questions: Why does David say magic is suddenly more difficult at the end, even though the contract still exists? Shouldn’t it not matter who the “youngest” heir is, since David is still part of the family and the contract remains in place?  \n\n- **Character Consistency and Depth:**  \n   - David’s wealth and career as a lawyer in a shabby magical society didn’t make sense. If he’s so rich, why doesn’t he improve the society’s conditions? Why did he become a lawyer? These details felt underdeveloped and lacked meaningful reasoning.  \n   - The non-reactions to Moira and Rhys learning about the abuse David suffered from his father were shocking. David mentioned losing a tooth due to an incident, and it was shrugged off. This lack of emotional depth epitomized the book’s problems—everything felt surface-level and unreal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel struggled with inconsistent character motivations, predictable plot twists, and a lack of worldbuilding. The relationships felt shallow, and the story often relied on contrived logic.

It was unexpected because I enjoyed the author's previous work, *A Dowry of Blood*.  \n   - I described the book as \"a traffic accident\"—tragic and unexpected.  \n\n- **Writing Style (Prose):**  \n   - The prose itself is not bad; I don’t mind the author’s writing style.  \n   - However, the book reads like a well-written romantic fanfiction, which strips away the plot and focuses solely on romance.  \n\n- **Plot and Storytelling:**  \n   - The plot is severely lacking. The book was marketed as a story about demon possessions, powerful sorcerers, and an elite occult society, but these elements are underutilized.  \n   - The demon possession aspect only appears after 200 pages and is resolved in an underwhelming manner (e.g., telling the demon to \"Fu*ck off\").  \n   - The elite occult society is reduced to boring politics and shallow romantic encounters, with no meaningful exploration of the fantasy elements.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n   - The romance is the central focus but is executed poorly. It feels boring, lackluster, and, at times, uncomfortable (e.g., the sex scenes were cringe-worthy).  \n   - The dynamic between the characters—a man, his ex-lover, and his wife—is unconvincing. The wife’s acceptance of her husband’s infidelity is unrealistic and poorly portrayed.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - The characters lack depth. The wife, in particular, is idealized to an absurd degree (e.g., \"her farts smell like violets\"), making her feel unrealistic and one-dimensional.  \n   - The relationships between the characters are shallow and fail to engage the reader.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n   - The book attempts to explore themes of polygamy or open relationships but does so in a way that feels dull and uninspired.  \n   - The fantasy and occult elements are wasted, adding no weight or intrigue to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a major letdown.

While I loved the concept—a queer, polyamorous, paranormal witchy tale—it ultimately fell short in execution.

I believe I would have loved the book if the romance had been entirely omitted. While I have no issues with polyamory in general, I struggled to connect with this particular romance.

From the very first page, I understood why some readers might be put off, as both male main characters are deeply narcissistic. Despite this, the mystery element was engaging and kept me invested. However, looking back, the curse's mystery was fairly obvious, and the supposedly intelligent characters should have unraveled it sooner.

David's emotional dependency on Moira, treating her as a maternal figure, is jarring and undermines his supposed maturity.

The secret occult society feels more like a mundane social club than a mysterious group.  \n   - The curse and its backstory are underdeveloped, with the primary threat being a case of influenza, which is underwhelming.  \n   - David’s role as a medium is not fully explored, leaving potential supernatural elements underutilized.  \n\n- **Romantic Focus:**  \n   - The book’s focus on the three-way romance overshadows other potentially interesting plotlines, leading to disappointment.  \n   - The romantic tension between the characters feels forced and lacks meaningful development.  \n\n- **Themes and Random Elements:**  \n   - The inclusion of casual Catholicism feels random and underdeveloped, appearing in both this book and *An Education in Malice* without clear purpose.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel falls short in delivering a compelling throuple romance or an engaging supernatural plot. The characters are unevenly developed, the occult elements lack depth, and the romantic focus feels forced. The inclusion of random themes, like Catholicism, adds to the overall disjointedness of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, these didn’t distract me from the story itself.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building was interesting, but the world felt small, as if only Rhys, Moira, and David existed in it. I loved the hints of world-building that occasionally broke through the trio’s drama.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The characters were told about rather than shown. For example, Rhys and Moira describe David as standoffish and arrogant, but his actions on the page don’t align with this description. He comes across as lukewarm and not particularly compelling.\n   - The relationships between the characters felt unnatural and rushed. Moira and David’s initial dislike for each other lasts only a few pages before they start working together harmoniously, which felt forced and sapped potential tension.\n   - The characters’ interactions and decisions often felt contrived, such as David randomly deciding to take Moira into his father’s bedroom without a clear catalyst.\n\n- **Stakes and Tension:**\n   - The stakes were unclear and lacked urgency. David’s illness is mentioned, but we never see it significantly impact his life or create a sense of danger. There’s no pressure-cooker timeline or visible progression of his condition.\n   - The plot unfolded too neatly, with answers dropping into the characters’ laps without struggle, misdirection, or tension. This made the story feel predictable and underwhelming.\n\n- **Pacing and Conflict:**\n   - The pacing of the relationships and plot progression was too quick, bypassing opportunities for riveting struggles and deeper conflict.\n   - The lack of ugly outbursts or hurtful interactions made the characters feel overly sanitized, as if they were all in therapy. While this might be admirable in real life, it made for a boring and hard-to-believe story.\n\n- **Author’s Approach:**\n   - It felt like the author loved her characters too much to let them struggle or clash meaningfully. This desire to establish solid relationships quickly came at the expense of tension and believability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel had a lot of potential, particularly in its world-building and initial premise. However, the lack of stakes, rushed character development, and “tell, not show” approach left me bored and underwhelmed.

This became clearer when I discovered there’s a prequel novella summarized at the beginning. David had some depth as the smarmy rich guy with a soft underbelly and personal issues, but Moira came across as a caricature—a flawless #girlboss and model minority. Rhys was particularly frustrating; his mistreatment of others was often excused due to his trauma or introversion. The intimacy between David and Moira was a highlight, reminiscent of what I loved in the author’s previous works. However, Rhys’s self-righteousness and his mistreatment of both David and Moira significantly detracted from the story. Moira, as the only Black female character, felt overly cautious in her portrayal, as if the author was hesitant to give her any flaws. Her southern accent and traditional upbringing were emphasized in a way that made her seem more like a stereotype than a fully realized character.",

The lack of a strong plot and atmospheric world-building made it difficult for me to fully engage with the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a rating of around 2.5 to 3 out of 5."

            "The book centers on the relationship between David and Rhys, which I found unappealing due to their immaturity, lustfulness, and selfishness. They lack the depth and emotional connection I anticipated. In contrast, Moira, Rhys’ wife, emerges as the most likable and intriguing character, yet she is sidelined and stripped of agency and dignity. Instead of being a fully realized character, she is reduced to a stereotypical black female role, supporting the two male protagonists without receiving equal attention or respect.

However, *Evocation* fell short of my expectations.

Instead of being a significant part of the story, it was reduced to David catching COVID, which felt anticlimactic and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel was a disappointment.

As a result, the focus on relationship dynamics overshadows the urban fantasy narrative, leading to uneven pacing.",

While Rhys and David's past is frequently referenced, it remains underexplored, leaving their motivations and unresolved feelings ambiguous. Additionally, Rhys and Moira's marriage is underdeveloped, lacking the backstory and emotional resonance needed to make it engaging. In contrast, the evolving friendship and emotional connection between David and Moira stand out as the most compelling and well-crafted elements of the story. Rhys's character comes across as bland and unlikable, with inconsistent motivations that seem more plot-driven than character-driven. In comparison, David and Moira are more intriguing, as their insecurities and supernatural abilities add layers to their personalities.",

Their book *A Dowry of Blood*, a retelling of Dracula, intrigued me, and I look forward to diving into that for a more satisfying reading experience.  \n\n- **Gratitude for the ARC:**  \n  - Thank you, NetGalley and the publisher, for providing the audio ARC of this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI was disappointed with this book and didn’t enjoy it as much as I had hoped. The story failed to meet my expectations due to its unbalanced narrative and lack of focus. However, I remain optimistic about the author’s potential and look forward to exploring their other works, particularly *A Dowry of Blood*.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot centers on Rhys, Moira, and David as they confront demonic possession and unresolved emotions, but it ultimately falls flat and lacks urgency. The Society's involvement feels unclear and irrelevant, contributing little to the narrative. Additionally, the portrayal of demonic possession and spirit sickness is inconsistent, often sidelined until needed for the plot. Key moments, such as Rhys discovering the demon's name in David's father's records, are initially dismissed by the characters, only to be revisited later, leading to confusion. The resolution of Evgeni's haunting is abrupt and unsatisfying, especially given his established strength and stubbornness. While the book is short, it feels overcrowded with subplots that detract from the main focus. A more concentrated exploration of David's possession and his relationship with his father would have strengthened the story, rather than the inclusion of The Society and the High Priesthood.",
            "The relationships between Rhys, Moira, and David are underdeveloped, relying on exposition rather than showing their dynamics. Key questions about their pasts, such as the history between Rhys and David and the foundation of Rhys and Moira's marriage, remain unanswered. The polyamorous aspect feels forced and inconsistent, with Moira's feelings toward David shifting to suit the plot rather than evolving naturally. Both Moira and Rhys lack depth and growth throughout the story, while David's character arc is minimal, as he only becomes slightly less antagonistic by the end. Additionally, Moira's ghost training and abilities are introduced but never fully explored or integrated into the plot.",

His abusive, controlling, and toxic behavior is romanticized rather than critiqued, which is troubling. His treatment of both David and Moira—including cheating and emotional manipulation—is framed as justifiable, overshadowing the serious issues at play. The dynamic between David and Rhys is deeply abusive, with Rhys humiliating and physically harming David, yet this relationship is glorified instead of condemned.

If I'm in his head, and he ISN'T thinking that, why am I reading it?\n\n- **Overall Engagement:**\n   - As the story went on, I got less and less interested.\n\n- **Value for Money:**\n   - I'm grateful I was able to get this book from my library because if I'd bought it, I would have regrets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book was a disappointment, especially compared to the author's previous work, *A Dowry of Blood*. The story lacked cohesion, the characters were unengaging, and the writing quality fell short. The portrayal of relationships and the unclear purpose of the \"Society\" left me frustrated. By the end, I had lost all interest in the characters and the plot. I’m glad I borrowed this book instead of purchasing it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2.5 stars"

Additionally, his Southern drawl for Moira, combined with her clichéd Southern belle dialogue, was painful to listen to.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot Execution:**  \n   - The premise—David, a medium possessed by a demon due to an inherited curse, seeking help from his occultist ex-lover Rhys and Rhys’ wife Moira—promised an intriguing fantasy story. However, the execution fell flat. The story devolved into a heavy-handed setup for a polyamorous relationship and politicking over who would lead the local occultist society, causing the main characters to largely ignore the pressing demonic possession issue for much of the book.  \n\n- **Fantasy Elements:**  \n   - The fantasy elements, such as the ability to see spirits and the demon itself, were extremely light and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Show vs. Tell:**  \n   - The book relied heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly in the occultist politicking subplot.

I struggled to understand or connect with the dynamics of poly/open relationships. Rhys, in particular, was a character I disliked—his over-the-top romantic gestures toward Moira felt forced, as if the author was trying to justify his relationship with David. David, on the other hand, was my favorite character. Despite his seemingly unlikeable exterior, I found his standoffishness endearing and appreciated the softer side beneath his cool demeanor.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  David’s character was well-crafted, and I enjoyed his complexity. However, the shift in David and Moira’s relationship from platonic to romantic by the end of the story felt unnecessary and detracted from their initial dynamic. Rhys’s character, unfortunately, fell flat for me and left a negative impression.  \n\n- **Genre Balance:**  \n  The book leaned so heavily into character development and relationships that the fantasy aspect of the story felt neglected. It was only sporadically included, which made the genre blend feel uneven and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its moments, particularly with David’s character, the heavy focus on the polyamorous relationship and the neglect of the fantasy elements left me feeling disconnected from the story. The imbalance between character-driven content and the underdeveloped plot ultimately made this a disappointing read for me. I will not be continuing with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars."

The development of their romantic and platonic relationships is a highlight of the book.

However, if you're interested in themes of conflict and polyamorous love, this might appeal to you.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters start off as somewhat two-dimensional and boring, but they do improve significantly as the story progresses.

There’s little interaction with it, and the actual prophecy isn’t revealed until the last ten chapters, which feels rushed and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The initial conflict between David and Reece feels flimsy, and the resolution of the curse is similarly underwhelming. Additionally, while the polyamorous relationship is explored, it would have been better if David had explicitly confirmed Reece's wife's consent, even though the audience knows she’s okay with it.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The book suffers from \"absolutely-gorgeous-character syndrome,\" where the characters are overly idealized, but this can be overlooked if you focus on the story's strengths.  \n\n- **Content Warning:**  \n  The book includes themes of alcoholism, which may be a trigger for some readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book doesn’t deliver on its initial promise of a demon possession story, it does offer a compelling exploration of conflict and polyamorous relationships.

A significant portion of the story (around 70%) felt aimless, with the stakes being neglected for too long.

The lack of tension and urgency left the story feeling flat.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  Unlike the author’s previous works, such as *A Dowry of Blood*, which deeply conveyed Costanza’s turmoil, this book failed to make me feel anything. The emotional resonance was completely missing.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narration on the audio ARC was disappointing. Even at 2x speed, it wasn’t smooth. The narrator added unnecessary pauses, disregarded page breaks, and there were noticeable editing issues, such as slight changes in tone or volume, which disrupted the listening experience.\n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  By the end of the book, I was so disengaged that I was falling asleep and didn’t even care about finishing it. The story lacked the depth and intrigue I expected, leaving me unsatisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel fell far short of my expectations, especially compared to the author’s previous works.

The magic serves more as a backdrop rather than a central focus.\n\n- **Romantic Focus and Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  The core of the story revolves around a relationship drama, specifically a polyamorous relationship with nontraditional forms of love. The romance is the primary driver of the narrative, with the magical elements playing a secondary role. This makes the book more appealing to readers who enjoy romance novels set in unique or unconventional settings.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The Boston setting is not fully explored, and there are missed opportunities to integrate the city's culture and infrastructure (like the MBTA) into the story. The lack of references to the MBTA, especially in a way that ties into the occult or demonic themes, is a notable omission.\n\n- **Appeal to Specific Readers:**  \n  The book is well-suited for readers who enjoy romance with a touch of the supernatural but may disappoint those seeking a more traditional occult urban fantasy. It is not ideal for readers who are not fans of romance or relationship-driven narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a relationship drama with a supernatural twist, focusing on polyamorous love and nontraditional relationships.

Most of the action occurs in the final 50 pages, culminating in a standard occult/exorcism scene that offers little originality. The narrative suffers from a lack of buildup and tension, with a slow pace that prioritizes relationship dynamics over plot development. This absence of significant events until the end leaves the story feeling unbalanced.",
            "This story lacks a compelling plot, stretching nearly 300 pages as three characters navigate their feelings for one another and the complexities of those feelings. The depiction of a Black woman serving as the emotional anchor for two white men is particularly uncomfortable.",
            "While I didn't entirely dislike the writing, I felt it warranted only 2 stars. I'm considering reading A Dowry of Blood to see if this author resonates with me.",
            "The book fell short of my expectations for an occult story, prioritizing relationship therapy over the anticipated occult themes. This disappointment has left me uninterested in continuing."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, this book was a disappointing read. It failed to deliver on the promised occult story, instead focusing heavily on relationship dynamics that felt unbalanced and, at times, uncomfortable. The lack of plot development and tension made it difficult to stay engaged, and the ending did little to redeem the slow pace. While the writing itself wasn't terrible, it wasn't enough to salvage the overall experience. I have no interest in continuing, but I will give the author another chance with a different book.",

While his development is believable, the narrative tends to tell rather than show his wit and intelligence. **Rhys:** Controlling, selfish, and toxic, he treats David poorly, constantly insulting and disregarding him, which makes their romantic relationship feel abusive and unenjoyable.

It should have screamed Dark Academia but instead felt superficial, giving off bougie Boston vibes.  \n   - The elements of secret societies, demonic circles, psychic powers, and haunted houses were present but underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n   - The plot felt like a lot of words were used for nothing.  \n   - The focus on romance overshadowed what could have been an amazing story about David’s struggle with his demonic deal, divination, and confronting his abusive past.  \n   - The resolution felt rushed and anticlimactic, making the plot stale and uninteresting.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - **Moira:** Painfully one-dimensional, over-designed, and caricatural. She was depicted as perfect, lacking flaws, which made her feel empty. Her dialogues sometimes felt forced.  \n   - **David:** The most complex character, a recovering alcoholic with trauma from child abuse. His development was believable, but the narrative often told rather than showed his supposed wit and intelligence.  \n   - **Rhys:** Controlling, selfish, and toxic. He treated David horribly, constantly insulting and disregarding him, which made their romantic relationship unenjoyable and abusive. His behavior was especially jarring given David’s past.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n   - The romance was not worth the attention it received. It felt unbalanced and unhealthy, particularly in the polyamorous dynamic.  \n   - Rhys’s treatment of David was perplexing and rubbed me the wrong way.  \n\n- **Overall Potential:**  \n   - The book had a lot of potential but ultimately wasted it. The plot, setting, and characters fell short of expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEvocation was a disappointment. While the cover was stunning and the concept of a polyamorous relationship was intriguing, the execution fell flat. The setting lacked depth, the plot was overshadowed by an unfulfilling romance, and the characters were either one-dimensional or poorly developed. The toxic dynamics in the polyamorous relationship, particularly Rhys’s treatment of David, were especially off-putting. Despite some interesting elements, the book failed to deliver on its potential, and I do not plan to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The audiobook narrator didn't resonate with me, particularly the voices chosen for Rhys and Moira. The love-driven conclusion felt underwhelming, and by the final pages, I found myself losing interest.",
            "David emerged as the most well-developed character, offering the most compelling perspective. I gradually appreciated the evolving friendship between David and Moira in the latter half of the story. However, Rhys posed a significant issue for me; I found him neglectful, cruel, and self-righteous, and he never offered a sincere apology for his actions. The dynamics within the trio were confusing and problematic, particularly regarding Rhys. The animosity directed at David felt unwarranted, and his behavior didn't match his reputation. Rhys's treatment of David following his relapse was particularly upsetting. While I was initially intrigued by Moira as a Black witch from the South, she ultimately felt underdeveloped and more like a caricature than a fully realized character. I also found the romance in this book frustrating; the lack of communication was exasperating, and the characters frequently ignored or crossed their own boundaries. Overall, the plot and world felt hollow, and the emphasis on the trio's miscommunication made the story drag painfully slow.",

Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments. The beginning was engaging and full of promise, with an interesting setup and introduction to the main character, David.

I adore S.T. Gibson as an author and expected this to become a new favorite. Unfortunately, it ended up being one of my biggest letdowns of the year.\n\n- **Engaging Start and Premise:**\n   - The beginning of the book was very engaging and showed a lot of promise. The setup and introduction to the main character, David, were interesting. The premise of him inheriting a family curse and needing the help of his ex and his ex's wife was intriguing. I also enjoyed the introductions of Rhys and Moira.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - David was the most fleshed-out character with the most interesting POV. I slowly grew to like David and Moira's newfound friendship in the second half of the story. However, Rhys was a major issue for me. I found him neglectful, cruel, and self-righteous, and he never genuinely apologized for his behavior.\n\n- **Magic System and Setting:**\n   - The magic systems in the book were compelling, but I wished there was more magic showcased and explained. The settings of a secret society and a sentient haunted house were fascinating, and I hoped to see more of both.\n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - The trio's relationship dynamics were confusing and problematic, especially concerning Rhys. The animosity towards David felt undeserved, and his actions didn't align with his reputation. The way Rhys treated David after his relapse was upsetting and gross. Moira's depiction as a Black witch from the South initially excited me, but she felt underdeveloped and more like a caricature than a fully realized character.\n\n- **Romance and Communication:**\n   - I detested the romance in this book. The lack of communication was insufferable, and the characters often ignored or crossed their own boundaries. The plot and world felt hollow, and the focus on the trio's miscommunication made the story feel painfully slow.\n\n- **Narration and Ending:**\n   - The audiobook narrator wasn't my favorite, and I didn't like the voices used for Rhys or Moira. The \"power of love\" ending was underwhelming, and by the last few pages, I was just over it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I found \"Evocation\" to be a disappointing read despite its strong premise and initial promise. The characters felt flat, the romance was frustrating, and the plot lacked depth. While I still think S.T. Gibson is a skilled writer, this book didn't meet my expectations. I hope the series improves with future installments.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2 stars."

On a positive note, the book does offer commendable representation of polyamory, providing a refreshing approach to resolving love triangles.",

While the characters were well-developed and the concept of the curse had potential, the overemphasis on the polyamorous relationship and the lack of suspense due to the synopsis revealing too much made it unengaging. I would not recommend this book, especially to readers looking for a strong focus on magic and supernatural themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Engagement: 2/5  \n- Character Development: 4/5  \n- Plot Execution: 2/5  \n- Overall Enjoyment: 2/5"

            "The first half of the book was a delight, showing promise as a potential favorite. However, the second half faltered, revealing noticeable flaws. The fantasy storyline often feels secondary to the throuple relationship, making it clear that the author prioritizes romance over fantasy. This has led to comparisons with fanfiction, where the fantasy elements are overshadowed by the romantic dynamics.",
            "The characters are enjoyable, and their history is intriguing. Moira, the female protagonist, is likable, but her role is overly dependent on her relationships with Rhys and David. While her backstory is present, her motivations in the current storyline feel too centered around the two men, limiting her character development. Moira lacks the space to be flawed, and her reactions, particularly in her relationships, often come across as quick and unrealistic. Her position as a mediator between Rhys and David subtly reinforces a misogynistic trope, sidelining her to support the male-male relationship. \n\nHowever, Moira and David's platonic bond is a highlight, feeling intense and soulmate-like, though it remains primarily tied to their connection with Rhys. While Rhys and Moira's established relationship is pleasant, it lacks significant challenges in this book. Rhys and David's romance, though a good concept, relies heavily on their past as exes, with little focus on their reconnection and renewed love. Overall, Moira's portrayal reflects a frustrating trope of sidelining female characters to elevate male relationships. The throuple dynamic may appeal to fans of such arrangements, but the execution leaves much to be desired."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Initial Hesitation and Expectations:**  \n  I was hesitant to read *Evocation* because I had previously read *An Education of Malice* by JT Gibson earlier this year, which was one of my least favorite books of 2024. I wasn’t sure if I was ready to try another book by the same author, but my friends encouraged me to give JT Gibson another chance. While I’m glad I did, I still don’t think JT Gibson’s works are for me.\n\n- **Confusion with the Beginning:**  \n  When I first started reading *Evocation*, I was very confused because it felt like a sequel. I even panicked, thinking I had accidentally read the book out of order. After checking Goodreads, I realized others felt the same way, and it became clear that the book simply throws readers right into the story. Once I got past the initial confusion and lack of backstory between David and Rhys, the story began to flow better, especially by the 40% mark.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  One issue I had with the book was the lack of detail about the magic system and world-building. I would have liked more explanation and depth in these areas. Hopefully, JT Gibson elaborates more on these aspects in the second book.\n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  My favorite part of the book was the relationship between David, Rhys, and Moira. I enjoyed their dynamic and believe many readers will appreciate their journey together.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Re-read Potential:**  \n  While there were parts of the book I enjoyed, it’s not a story I would read again. That said, I’m certain that someone else will absolutely love this book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite my initial hesitation and some confusion at the start, *Evocation* had moments I enjoyed, particularly the character dynamics. However, the lack of detailed world-building and my personal preferences mean this isn’t a book I’d revisit, though I can see it resonating strongly with other readers.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The abrupt revelation at the end, which excluded her from the relationship, left many questions unanswered.

            "The plot lacks consistency, with several moments of potential that fail to fully develop. The relationship progression feels sluggish and remains incomplete by the book's conclusion. Additionally, the narrative struggles to balance its themes of messy, toxic love with therapy-like moralizing, especially from Rhys.",
            "The romance in this book surprisingly lacks tenderness, which is unexpected for a story focused on relationships. While there are some sweet moments between Rhys and Moira, they ultimately feel unconvincing. Rhys refers to Moira as a \"goddess,\" yet the emotional depth and genuine connection are noticeably absent. The dynamic between Rhys and David is also problematic; David comes across as a snooty jerk, and Rhys's harsh treatment of him is neither well-explained nor justified. Rhys himself is a significant issue in the narrative. His actions and attitude, particularly towards David, are selfish and unsympathetic, as he often shirks responsibility while being overly critical of others. In fact, the story might benefit from Rhys's absence, as his character detracts from its overall potential.",

Rhys’s character is a significant drawback, and the book’s attempt to balance messy romance with moralizing doesn’t quite work. Despite these flaws, there’s enough good here to see what the story could have been in a more balanced and emotionally satisfying version.",

However, it ultimately left me feeling unsatisfied.\n   - The narrative focus is more on romance than on mystery or cursebreaking adventure, which was unexpected.\n\n- **Romance and Character Relationships:**\n   - The romance lacks tenderness, which is surprising for a book centered on relationships.\n   - The relationship between Rhys and Moira has some sweet moments, but they feel unconvincing. Rhys calls Moira \"goddess,\" but the emotional depth and genuine connection are missing.\n   - The dynamic between Rhys and David is problematic. David is portrayed as a snooty asshole, and the reasons for Rhys's harsh treatment of him are not well-explained or shown.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is inconsistent, with moments of potential development that don’t fully materialize. The relationship development feels slow and incomplete, even by the end of the book.\n   - The book struggles to balance its themes of messy, toxic love with therapy-like moralizing, particularly from Rhys.\n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Themes (Alcoholism and Addiction):**\n   - The portrayal of alcoholism and addiction recovery is triggering and poorly handled. David’s struggles are not given the depth or support they deserve.\n   - Rhys’s treatment of David during his relapse is harsh and unsympathetic, which undermines the book’s attempts at moralizing.\n\n- **Atmosphere and World-Building:**\n   - The middle section of the book, where David and Moira work together on magic and the Beacon Hill house, is the most atmospheric and enjoyable part. It’s where the character relationships feel the most authentic.\n\n- **Character Critique (Rhys):**\n   - Rhys is a major issue in the book. His actions and attitude, particularly toward David, are selfish and unsympathetic. He often absolves himself of responsibility while being overly critical of others.\n   - The reviewer suggests that the book would be better without Rhys, as his presence detracts from the potential of the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book has moments of promise, particularly in its atmospheric middle section and the developing relationship between David and Moira, it ultimately falls short due to its lack of tenderness, inconsistent pacing, and problematic handling of sensitive themes. Rhys’s character is a significant drawback, and the book’s attempt to balance messy romance with moralizing doesn’t quite work.

The elements felt grounded in real practices and were thoughtfully researched in terms of accuracy, based on what I know.  \n\n- **Themes and Relationships:**  \n   - I appreciated the exploration of love and how it can manifest in many forms. The way the primary characters navigated their relationship was compelling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n   - The pacing of the book was terrible, and it felt like there was no central plot. The story lacked a cohesive direction, which made it hard to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters were underdeveloped. We were introduced to them once and expected to see them as important to the story, but they lacked depth and growth.  \n   - The lengthy aesthetic descriptions of each character felt more like idealized self-inserts of taste rather than relatable, fleshed-out individuals.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement and Potential:**  \n   - I kept wanting the book to get better, but it never did. Despite its flaws, I’m excited to see what this author might do with more time and experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had strong points, such as its well-researched occult elements and thoughtful exploration of relationships, it was ultimately let down by poor pacing, a lack of central plot, and underdeveloped characters. Despite these issues, the author shows potential, and I look forward to their future work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The love triangle involving Rhys, Moira, and David was intriguing but could have been executed more effectively. Rhys often came off as a stoic yet immature character, which diminished his appeal. Despite being married to Rhys, Moira's relationship with David, Rhys's ex, was far more engaging. While the dynamics among the three were central to the story, the author failed to explore them as deeply as I had hoped.",

I found it hard to get into, and I wish there had been more depth and exploration of the magical elements.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  I enjoyed the Boston aspect of the story. It added a unique flavor to the narrative that I appreciated.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The trouple situation (Rhys, Moira, and David) was intriguing, but I felt it could have been executed better. Rhys came across as a \"big manly stoic baby,\" which made him less compelling. Despite Moira being married to Rhys, her relationship with David was more interesting, even though David and Rhys were exes. The relationships between the three characters were the main focus of the book, but the author didn’t delve into them as deeply as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The book touched on heavy themes like addiction and abuse, but they were handled in a way that felt too light and lacked emotional weight. This made parts of the story feel boring and unengaging.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It took me until about halfway through the book to really get into it. The pacing was uneven, and I struggled to stay engaged for much of the first half.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  Despite my disappointment, I might read the second book in the series out of curiosity when it comes out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some interesting elements, such as the Boston setting and the trouple dynamic, it fell short in terms of magic, emotional depth, and relationship exploration.

The plot progression also felt rushed, especially the transition from kissing an ex, not talking for a week, meeting at a ceremony, and then hooking up in the last chapter.  \n\n- **Character Development and Dynamics:**  \n  The characters seemed underutilized. Many were introduced just to deliver one-liners without contributing meaningfully to the story. Additionally, the relationships felt underdeveloped. For example, Rhys and his wife made decisions without consulting David, which made their interactions feel unrealistic.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Communication:**  \n  Most of the conversations happened behind closed doors, often excluding key characters. This made the interactions feel incomplete and disconnected. The overuse of the term “ex” also became repetitive and distracting.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics:**  \n  While I appreciate diverse relationships, the dynamics here felt forced and poorly explored. The lack of meaningful communication between characters, especially in critical moments, made their connections feel shallow.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had interesting elements and potential, but the execution fell flat. The plot lacked depth, characters felt underdeveloped, and the dialogue and relationships were unconvincing. It was a disappointing read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This lack of depth and coherence left me unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The romance fell flat for me. While I’m not opposed to polyamory, I struggled to understand what Moira gained from her dynamic with the two overly emotional men. It felt more like babysitting than a meaningful relationship. If Moira were to have a girlfriend in the future, I wouldn’t be interested in finding out.  \n\n- **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n  This book was a huge disappointment compared to *Dowry of Blood*, which I loved. The contrast in quality and engagement made this experience particularly underwhelming.  \n\n- **Impact on Future Reading:**  \n  This book has made me hesitant to read *An Education in Malice*, which I was initially excited about. My disappointment with this novel has dampened my enthusiasm for the author’s other works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel failed to meet my expectations, especially in terms of plot and romance. The lack of depth and emotional resonance left me feeling disconnected and uninterested in exploring the author’s future works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Gibson.  \n   - The book wasn’t horrible, and the writing had merit, even if the story didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n- **Recommendation and Audience Appeal:**  \n   - I would 100% recommend this book to others, especially those on the fence about reading it.  \n   - People seem to love this book, so my personal experience shouldn’t deter potential readers.  \n   - I suggest borrowing it from the library before committing to buying a hardcover.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn’t personally connect with the characters or the central relationship, I appreciated the writing and the concept of the story. It wasn’t a bad book, just not entirely for me. I’d still encourage others to give it a chance, as they might have a different experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review."

However, this element was surprisingly underdeveloped, fading into the background until the final act, where its resolution felt anticlimactic and unsatisfying. It seemed more like a plot device to facilitate the polyamorous trio's drama than a central theme. \n\nMoreover, the subplot surrounding the High Priest election overshadowed the demon curse, yet it lacked sufficient context to explain its significance within the broader narrative. Overall, the focus on this mundane Society detracted from the more intriguing elements of the story.",

However, this aspect was shockingly underdeveloped and felt relegated to a faint backdrop. It only resurfaced in the final stretch, where the story attempted to address it in an anticlimactic and unsatisfying way. The curse’s resolution felt incomplete, clearly shelved for future installments. Looking back, it seemed the curse merely served as a fantastical plot device to set the stage for the polyamorous trio and provide drama.  \n\n  Additionally, the subplot about the High Priest election felt unnecessarily prioritized over the demon curse. Despite its prominence, there was little context for why leading this traditionalist, mundane Society mattered in the grand scheme of things.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was lacking and left much to be desired. Elements like the Society, summonings, mediumship, and tarot were introduced but not explored in satisfying depth. By the end, I had many unanswered questions: How are magical groups coordinated?

By the end, there's an open marriage, but that isn't technically the same as polyamory. The relationship dynamics begin with cheating and then force one person to accept it over time, which feels like poor representation.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**\n   - The book was boring and didn't meet expectations based on the synopsis. I anticipated elements like magic, occult themes, deals with the devil, and dark family histories, but the story primarily focuses on a \"throuple\" dynamic. It lacked the dark, spooky atmosphere I was hoping for.\n\n- **Character Development (Moira):**\n   - Moira, a woman of color, was poorly handled. She was used as a crutch for two white men and made a significant sacrifice for them, which felt exploitative and wrong. Her character deserved more focus, attention, and care. It seems like black sensitivity readers were not involved in the process.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**\n   - The narration was disappointing. While the voice for David was fine, the voices for Rhys and Moira felt like cartoon characters and didn't match their personalities. A full cast narration would have been a better choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, I was deeply disappointed by this book. As a fan of S.T.

            "Moira is portrayed as a one-dimensional stereotype of the \"strong black woman\" and \"caretaker,\" despite being a main character. Her role is primarily to support Rhys and David emotionally, reducing her to superficial traits like being a \"girlboss\" or \"bad bitch.\" Rather than being a fully realized individual, she is depicted as a goddess and salvation for Rhys, who is unfaithful to her. Her calm acceptance of this betrayal feels unrealistic and dismissive of her emotions.\n\nAlthough the book is marketed as polyamorous, it primarily focuses on the romance between David and Rhys, sidelining Moira in her own marriage and treating her as a mere side character. Rhys's love for Moira comes across as insincere, as he is more preoccupied with his unresolved feelings for David. The relationship dynamics are toxic and lack the fun or angst typically associated with polyamorous narratives. The chemistry between Rhys and David overshadows any genuine connection with Moira.\n\nRhys is depicted as self-righteous and toxic, treating both Moira and David poorly. He uses Moira as a symbol of his redemption while loving David conditionally, only when sober. The narrative fails to hold Rhys accountable for his actions, portraying him as the \"good guy\" despite his harmful behavior. Moira's character perpetuates damaging stereotypes of black women as strong, unemotional caretakers, and the book ultimately denies her the depth, respect, and agency she deserves. This treatment feels dismissive and misogynistic, reflecting a broader trend of sidelining female characters in favor of male narratives.",
            "The prose comes across as overly descriptive and reminiscent of fanfiction, lacking the lyrical quality found in the author's earlier works. The dialogue between Rhys and Moira feels scripted and unconvincing, as the writing tends to tell rather than show, resulting in relationships that feel forced and unbelievable."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book was a major disappointment, especially given the high expectations set by the author’s previous work. Moira’s character was done a disservice, reduced to a stereotype and sidelined in her own story. The romantic relationships were toxic and poorly executed, and the writing lacked the lyrical quality that made the author’s earlier work stand out. The handling of themes like addiction and polyamory was shallow and unsatisfying. Overall, this book felt like a missed opportunity and left me deeply frustrated.",

            "The plot is insubstantial, centering on the main character falling ill due to a demon and seeking a cure. The story lacks depth, with events feeling superficial and failing to resonate with the reader. The narrative is overly simplistic, lacking the complexity and intrigue needed to maintain interest.",
            "The portrayal of the polyamorous relationship in this story is notably flawed. The dynamic between David, Rhys, and Moira feels unbalanced and lacks depth. While David, the protagonist, emerges as the most sympathetic character, he is unfairly treated by Rhys and Moira, who perceive him as a threat to their marriage. Rhys, in particular, displays a troubling lack of empathy, especially during David's vulnerable moments, such as his relapse. Although Moira shows some compassion, she ultimately fails to provide the support David needs, resulting in an unequal and unfulfilling relationship. Additionally, the depiction of addiction and its effects on relationships is problematic, with David unjustly bearing the blame for his struggles.",

The author fails to challenge societal norms or explore the complexities of polyamory, leading to a sanitized and unengaging portrayal. Additionally, the treatment of addiction is frustratingly simplistic, depicting David's struggles as an inconvenience to others rather than addressing them as a serious mental health issue.",
            "I felt frustrated and angry at how David is treated throughout the story, especially in scenes where his vulnerability is met with hostility from Rhys. The emotional impact is largely negative, leaving me feeling more exasperated than engaged or moved by the characters and their relationships."

While the prose is pleasant and the story is easy to read, the lack of depth, emotional resonance, and meaningful exploration of its themes makes it a disappointing read. The treatment of addiction and the unbalanced dynamics within the central relationship further detract from my overall experience, leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied.",

            "The pacing of the novel presents a significant issue, especially in the handling of the climax and resolution. While the buildup is both uncomfortable and tragic, the author seems to overlook the full weight of this tragedy. Additionally, the accompanying novella, intended to provide backstory and context, feels poorly integrated into the main narrative. Key revelations about Moira's biphobia and David's treatment are crucial but insufficiently explored in the novel.",
            "This review examines the horror-like dynamics of the relationships between David, Rhys, and Moira. While I appreciate complex and messy relationships, I believe it's crucial to be mindful of how these dynamics are portrayed. I find the author's treatment of Rhys and Moira's relationship problematic, as it seems to favor Rhys excessively, which detracts from the narrative's balance and depth. \n\nDavid's treatment by Rhys and Moira is particularly concerning, especially given the lack of acknowledgment of Moira's biphobia and the unbalanced power dynamics at play. Rhys comes across as uninteresting and underdeveloped compared to the more compelling characters of David and Moira. His lack of depth makes him less engaging. \n\nDavid is portrayed sympathetically, with his struggles and vulnerabilities making him a relatable character. However, I am frustrated by how he is mistreated and undervalued by both Rhys and Moira. Initially, I liked Moira, but her biphobic tendencies later shift my perception of her character. Overall, I am disappointed by the narrative's failure to address these flaws.",
            "The novel delves into themes of jealousy, biphobia, and toxic relationships, which I find compelling. However, I am critical of the author's failure to fully acknowledge the moral ambiguities and flaws in the characters' actions. The asymmetry in the relationships, particularly the framing of David's mistreatment as acceptable or deserved, is troubling. The narrative would benefit from a more balanced exploration of all characters' flaws and biases.",
            "The novel's emotional impact is both profound and deeply unsettling. David's tragic resignation to his fate feels like a logical conclusion to the narrative, yet it leaves a lasting discomfort. I am particularly struck by the portrayal of David's suffering and the failure of other characters to recognize his worth. This emotional weight is a central aspect of my review."

If a man said these things to me, I would be completely won over.  \n\n- **Author's Previous Work Comparison:**  \n   - ST Gibson is an amazing author, as evidenced by her breakout hit *A Dowry of Blood*, which had emotional depth, a compelling plot, and well-developed characters. Unfortunately, *Evocation* lacks all of these qualities.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is bland, pretentious, and lacks any sort of emotional depth. It revolves around David, a medium, Rhys (his ex-lover and a scholar of magical things), and Moria (Rhys's wife, who is supposedly a witch). The story focuses on what is causing David's nightmares and their wealthy occult society, but it fails to be interesting or thought-provoking.  \n   - The pacing is a major issue, with the plot dragging for 60% of the book.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - Moria is portrayed as an amazing, understanding, and emotionally in-tune witch, but she comes across as manipulative.  \n   - Rhys pretends not to care about money and power, but he clearly craves both.  \n   - David is unremarkable and lacks depth; he is simply \"just David.\"  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - The book is boring and fails to engage the reader.

            "The story centers on David's illness, the dynamics among the trio, and the competition for the High Priest position. However, these plotlines feel underdeveloped. The competition lacks tension and meaningful action, as Rhys and David are assured of their success without any clear justification. Rhys's role as High Priest is vaguely summarized, rendering this subplot irrelevant. Additionally, the demon summoning subplot is introduced late and resolved hastily, with crucial information withheld until the end, leading to a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion. Overall, the pacing is uneven, with significant plot points introduced too late and resolved too quickly, leaving important elements like the demon summoning subplot inadequately explored.",
            "The characters, especially Rhys and Moira, are more described than developed. Rhys is portrayed as ambitious and scheming, yet his actions fail to reflect these traits; he reads, compliments his wife, and attends society meetings, but we never witness any actual scheming or ambition. Moira, on the other hand, is depicted as flawless—poised, beautiful, confident, and wise—lacking any real flaws or mistakes, which renders her unrealistic. While her jealousy and exclusion are mentioned, they are never explored, and her subplot about fearing her ability to see ghosts is resolved too quickly and then forgotten. David's ambition is evident through his work ethic, but his aspiration to become High Priest lacks depth, especially given the society's diminished influence, which makes his ambition feel hollow.",

            "I was initially excited about the possession theme, but it ended up being a minor element of the story. The occult aspects I anticipated were largely absent, and the polyamory subplot felt unexpected and underdeveloped. Moira's acceptance of this new dynamic seemed rushed and unrealistic, particularly given her recent experience with infidelity.",

Rhys’s relationship with her felt inconsistent; while he seemed to worship her, he often treated her more as an emotional support figure than an equal partner. The dynamics among the male characters overshadowed Moira’s potential as a strong, independent character.",

The narrative shifts abruptly from a serious crisis to a slice-of-life/cozy fantasy, only to abruptly recall the plot just before the conclusion. Many events occur randomly for the sake of convenience, lacking logical setup or payoff. Ultimately, the story fails to capitalize on its initial premise, leaving numerous threads unresolved or underdeveloped.",

David's motivation to secure the high priest position remains unclear, as the society's purpose is never adequately explained. Rhys's serious moment feels confusing, as there's no indication he wasn't already aware of the information revealed. Additionally, David's role as a lawyer is poorly established, leading to confusion during a courtroom scene. The characters lack depth and personality, with potentially interesting traits—such as Rhys's lack of magical talent—left unexplored. The romance feels unconvincing, relying on characters reciting flattery and promises rather than demonstrating a genuine connection. While there is potential for dramatic relationship conflict, it is entirely overlooked. Moira, though somewhat stereotypical, at least possesses some defining traits, while other characters remain flat and unmemorable.",

If Rhys is in his late 20s, he would likely be aware of these issues, yet his unwavering commitment to the church is neither explored nor justified.

David, a wealthy Russian from Beacon Street, and Moira, an exaggerated Southern caricature, feel out of place. Moira's excessive use of \"mee-maw\" detracts from her character, making her scenes feel forced. Additionally, the absence of Boston accents and the indistinct side characters suggest that the story could easily be set in any city without losing its essence.",

However, the connection between David’s trauma and Rhys’s staunch Catholicism feels underdeveloped and potentially insensitive, given the Catholic Church’s history in Boston.\n  - The troubling scene where Rhys says he wants to hit David is never resolved, leaving a negative impression of both the character and the story’s handling of conflict.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel’s Boston setting initially intrigued me, the lack of authentic representation, poorly developed characters, and mishandling of sensitive topics left me disappointed. The audiobook’s technical issues further detracted from the experience. The story had potential but fell short in execution, particularly in addressing complex themes and creating believable, nuanced characters.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While *A Dowry of Blood* handled similar themes well, this book seemed to be heading toward a redemption arc for the toxic manipulator, which I found problematic. Instead of writing this character out of the protagonists' lives, the author seemed to be writing him further into their lives, potentially leading to a ménage à trois or poly relationship. This is not something I want to read, and I feel that readers with similar trauma deserve a heads-up about this content.  \n\n- **Author’s Repetition of Themes:**  \n  Considering this is the second book by the author based on toxic relationship dynamics, I’m hesitant to pick up another book by S.T.

It’s worrying to see an author repeatedly explore manipulative and abusive characters without offering a clear resolution or warning for sensitive readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed *A Dowry of Blood*, this book fell far short of my expectations.

It feels less engaging than mundane activities like eating clay.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing lacks the beautiful, effortless prose seen in *Dowry of Blood*. Instead, it reads like middling, unpolished fanfiction, with a complete lack of dynamism.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters are insufferable and poorly developed. Rhys and Moira are selfish, boring, and have huge chips on their shoulders. Moira is a one-dimensional caricature of a southern belle, with no personality beyond stereotypes. Rhys is equally uninteresting, riddled with guilt and condescension. David, while somewhat tolerable, is not compelling enough to carry the story.  \n\n- **Moralizing and Themes:**  \n   - The book attempts to moralize about wealth and class, portraying David as bad because he’s rich and Rhys and Moira as good because they’re not. However, this dynamic isn’t earned. David’s actions don’t justify the constant ire he receives, and the story fails to show why Rhys and Moira’s treatment of him is warranted.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot is uneventful and slow. Over halfway through the book, there’s only a single instance of maybe-possession and minimal magic or demonic elements. The story lacks excitement and fails to deliver on its potential.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - The pre-poly relationship is boring and unengaging. Rhys’s guilt-ridden desire for his ex could have been an interesting subplot, but it’s overshadowed by his condescension and overcompensation with Moira.  \n\n- **World-Building and Magic:**  \n   - The magical elements are barely present, with most of the action happening off-screen. The lack of demonic possession and secrets makes the story feel flat and uninteresting.  \n\n- **Cover Design:**  \n   - The only positive aspect mentioned is the stunning cover design.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book fails to deliver on its intriguing premise, with poor execution, insufferable characters, and a lackluster plot.

That’s a stretch, especially when her husband appears to be more in love with his new partner than with her. I can't relate to that. Additionally, the portrayal of Moira leans into the problematic \"mammy\" trope, which feels outdated and unnecessary. This issue isn't about her race; it’s about the character's depth and agency.",

I couldn’t envision them doing anything beyond the cliched tropes and stereotypes that dominated the final quarter of the book.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  The author heavily relied on tropes, particularly with the character Moira, and then casually introduced a conversation about polyamory that felt underdeveloped and dismissive.  \n\n- **Originality of Premise:**  \n  The premise didn’t strike me as original—witchy dudebros vying for power, who reject being called witches due to the feminine connotation, felt overdone and uninspired.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n  I was drawn to the book because of its cover, which I found appealing.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  While I read the book quickly, my overall reaction was underwhelming—it left me feeling indifferent, with a strong “meh” impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel didn’t resonate with me due to its flat characters, reliance on cliched tropes, and lack of originality.

            "The story focuses more on the relationship dynamics between David, Rhys, and Moira than on the plot or world-building, which feels secondary. The progression of their polyamorous relationship is central, but the setup is uncomfortable and poorly executed, especially due to Rhys's lack of transparency with Moira.",
            "In this story, David grapples with a curse and turns to his ex-boyfriend, Rhys, for help. However, Rhys comes off as cowardly and inconsistent, with his 26 years feeling mismatched with his immature and passive demeanor. While Moira shows more empathy toward David, her role in the relationship feels underdeveloped. The lack of chemistry among the characters, particularly due to Rhys's weak characterization, renders their dynamics forced and unengaging. The progression of the polyamorous relationship feels unnatural, especially since Rhys fails to disclose his past with David to Moira. This lack of closure between Rhys and David, coupled with Rhys's passivity, creates a toxic rather than compelling relationship. Additionally, the \"why choose\" trope is poorly executed, lacking the emotional depth and yearning typically associated with such narratives.",

Instead of being fully developed, she often played the role of relationship referee between Rhys and David, which undermined her potential. The drama between Rhys and David felt excessive, leaving me more invested in the platonic bond between David and Moira. As a love interest, Rhys came across as lukewarm and unremarkable.",

The dark themes lacked the depth and impact I craved, reminiscent of the heavy, soul-crushing experience of *A Dowry of Blood*, but this felt more like a YA Lite version. The portrayal of dark magic was shallow, and the demon possession plotline surrounding David's curse felt underwhelming, resembling a fleeting trend rather than a centuries-old haunting.",

The gothic atmosphere, or any distinct atmosphere, is notably absent.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  - The story focuses heavily on Rhys and David's relationship, as well as Rhys and Moira's relationship. Unfortunately, none of these characters are compelling to me.  \n  - The throuple dynamic, which seems central to the plot, fails to engage me. I find myself uninterested in watching it unfold.  \n  - Moira's constant references to \"Meemaw\" and Rhys's repetitive discussions about \"boundaries\" feel tiresome and add little depth to the characters.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise Execution:**  \n  - The premise, which involves the Devil collecting on a century-old bargain, initially intrigued me. However, the execution falls short.  \n  - Elements like occult themes, magic, and secret society rituals are sidelined, leaving me disappointed. Instead, the story prioritizes \"charmless dialogue about The Past and Boundaries.\"  \n  - David's possession, which could have been a significant focal point, is underwhelmingly described as \"nothing more than a lingering cold,\" lacking the intensity or intrigue I anticipated.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *A Dowry of Blood* showcased the author's talent for beautiful prose and compelling themes, this novel fails to deliver on its promising premise.

Instead, the book delivered only 3 mediocre spicy scenes, no background on the occult society, no powerful sorcery, no actual spells, and no demonic elements like backward-talking demons.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt aimless, with the majority of the book spent describing clothes, at least 4 meals, and faffing about without purpose. Chaos magic was mentioned but had no impact on the storyline, and the inclusion of a trans character and polyamory felt superficial and added nothing to the development.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Dynamics:**  \n  The book was marketed under the MMF tag, but there was no MMF action. The male character declared himself gay throughout the book but inexplicably developed feelings for a woman, which felt forced and unrealistic. The portrayal of polyamory came off as casual cheating rather than a meaningful dynamic.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The relationships lacked depth and authenticity. The idea of a gay man and an open-minded wife doing their nails together was presented as sexual tension, which felt shallow and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Writing and Research:**  \n  The writing fell short in delivering on its promises. The spice and witchy elements were underwhelming, and the portrayal of smut lacked research and authenticity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointment, failing to deliver on its genre promises and lacking a coherent plot or meaningful character development.
