Her stepbrother, Oliver, plays a significant role in her life, helping her overcome depression and settle into a new place.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  The story starts strong, but around the 30% mark, it truly picks up as Amy becomes entangled in a potential crime involving a family member. The tension builds as she grapples with distinguishing fact from falsehood and is persuaded to cover the active case on her podcast. The central question—how far one would go to protect their only family—adds depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  While the story is intriguing, I felt the narrative sometimes lost focus. The narrator’s thoughts jumped around too much, which occasionally threw me off as a reader. Additionally, I wished there were actual podcast interviews included for deeper discussions, rather than just mentions of Amy having a podcast.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Comparisons:**  \n  Fans of authors like B.A. Paris, Shari Lapena, and Mary Kubica will likely enjoy this novel. It fits well within the psychological thriller genre and offers a gripping, character-driven story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a compelling read with a strong start and an intriguing premise. While the narrative could have been more focused and included deeper podcast elements, the story’s tension and moral dilemmas kept me engaged. It’s a solid choice for fans of psychological thrillers.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Did Oliver really attempt to kill his girlfriend? Was he being framed, or was he one of the toxic men she warns about on her podcast? The story is full of misdirection, making it impossible to predict the outcome.\n\n- **Character Development and Suspense:**\n   - The characters are complex and unreliable, adding to the suspense. I found myself questioning everyone’s motives and actions, unsure of who to trust. Oliver, who had been a supportive and strong sibling after their mother’s death, suddenly seemed suspicious. The author masterfully creates a sense of unease and keeps the reader immersed in the story.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - This book was a thrilling ride from beginning to end.

It felt like I had read a similar premise in previous books featuring similar characters. Sadly, this wasn’t just my perception—it was the book itself.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There was a noticeable lack of character development, which made it difficult to connect with or care about anyone, especially the main characters.  \n\n- **Pacing and Exposition:**  \n  The narrative felt abrupt due to rushed exposition, and the plot development came across as lazy.  \n\n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  I only read this book because I like the author, but her recent works have been disappointing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a strong start, its lack of originality, poor character development, and rushed pacing made it a disappointing read. Despite my appreciation for the author, this book fell short of my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Amy proved to be a compelling lead, and I found her sidekick, Dean, enjoyable as well. I appreciated that the story opted out of a romantic subplot, which felt refreshing. However, Laura's motives were somewhat lackluster, leaving some loose ends unaddressed. For instance, how did Laura successfully fake her death, and why did she resort to such extreme measures for money? Oliver's journey was also perplexing—how did he escape from the hospital, locate his sister held for ransom, kill Laura, and then turn around to accuse Amy? The descriptions of these pivotal events felt rushed and vague.",

While Amy’s background and podcast provided a natural context for her insights, other characters seemed to forcefully articulate their thoughts. Additionally, discussions on societal norms and non-controversial statements came across as somewhat overdone.",

However, just as I was about to lose interest, a sudden twist grabbed my attention and pulled me back in.  \n\n- **Character Development (Protagonist):**  \n  The protagonist, Amy Gibson, is highly intelligent with a PhD, but she lacks common sense. Despite her academic background and life experiences, she struggles to navigate the challenges and dangers she faces, often appearing naive and unprepared.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  K.L. Armstrong, also known as Kelley Armstrong, is the author behind popular series like Rockton, Haven’s Rock, and Rip Through Time. Unlike the strong, smart, and decisive female characters in those series, Amy feels like a departure—more gullible and less capable, which was disappointing.  \n\n- **Expectations for the Genre:**  \n  As a fan of Armstrong’s thrillers, I expected fast-paced action from the very beginning. The slow start and the protagonist’s lack of agency didn’t align with what I’ve come to love about her previous works.  \n\n- **Series Context:**  \n  “Known to the Victim” is the final standalone thriller by K.L. Armstrong, following previous titles like *The Life She Had*, *Wherever She Goes*, and *Every Step She Takes*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel eventually delivers a gripping twist, the slow start and the protagonist’s lack of common sense made it a less satisfying read compared to Armstrong’s other works. Fans of her strong, action-driven female characters might find Amy Gibson’s portrayal underwhelming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Armstrong, is a deviously sneaky book that delves into complex themes of abuse, gaslighting, and murder.  \n  - The story follows Amy Gibson, a Ph.D. candidate and podcaster, whose work focuses on cases where people, mostly women, become victims of these injustices.  \n  - The plot thickens when Amy's brother is framed for the very crimes she speaks out against, forcing her to investigate a case that is far from black and white.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Amy Gibson is a compelling protagonist, portrayed as both an academic and an advocate, which adds depth to her character.  \n  - The narrative effectively explores her internal struggles, particularly the self-doubt that often accompanies situations of abuse, making her relatable and human.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The book is wonderfully well-written, with Kelley Armstrong's signature skill in crafting engaging and thought-provoking prose.  \n  - The writing highlights the subtleties of abuse, making it easy for readers to understand how victims might question their own experiences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI thoroughly enjoyed *Known to the Victim* for its intricate plot, well-developed characters, and insightful exploration of abuse and its psychological impacts. Kelley Armstrong has once again delivered a compelling and thought-provoking read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Her estranged half-brother steps in to help her recover, and she eventually thrives, pursuing a PhD and hosting a successful podcast on violence against victims, *Known to the Victim*. However, the story takes a twist when it becomes clear that her half-brother may not be the hero he initially appears to be. While the plot has potential, it lacks the depth and impact to leave a lasting impression.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Amy is portrayed as a resilient and driven character, successfully overcoming her traumatic past and channeling her experiences into meaningful work. Her half-brother, initially presented as a supportive figure, is later revealed to have a more complex and possibly darker role, adding intrigue to his character.  \n\n- **Engagement and Impact:**  \n  The story is engaging enough to keep readers interested, but it doesn’t deliver the emotional or intellectual depth to make it truly memorable. It’s a decent read for passing the time, but it didn’t leave a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a compelling premise with a protagonist who overcomes significant adversity, but the execution falls short of being truly impactful. While it’s a decent read, it lacks the depth and emotional resonance to make it stand out.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nRounded from 3.5*"
