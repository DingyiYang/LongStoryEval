            "The suspense is expertly crafted, but the ending disappoints. I expected a significant showdown between Sol and the antagonist, yet the climax fizzles and shifts abruptly to the epilogue. Although the twist at the end aligns with the story, the absence of a satisfying climax is a letdown.",
            "The characters, especially Veronica and the children, evoke a sense of nightmare reminiscent of an M. Night Shyamalan film. Sol's character is well-developed, with her interactions and perspective shaped by the book's social commentary.",
            "This book evokes the unsettling tone and twist ending characteristic of an M. Night Shyamalan film. I can easily picture Shyamalan directing a film adaptation and making his signature cameo as a paramedic.",
            "The novel offers poignant social commentary on racism and homophobia. Although it can be somewhat heavy-handed at times, this approach enriches Sol's character and her experiences.",
            "This book masterfully blends psychological horror with an unsettling atmosphere, reminiscent of *The Stepford Wives* and *Midsommar*. It evokes a strong sense of unease and dread, keeping me guessing about the story's direction until the very end. While it steers clear of outright terror, it effectively conveys that something is fundamentally … wrong."

        "conclusion": "While the book excels in building suspense and creating a creepy, unsettling atmosphere, the ending lacks the climactic payoff I expected. The characters are memorable, and the social commentary adds depth, though it can feel heavy-handed at times. Overall, it’s a solid suburban horror novel that keeps readers uneasy and guessing, making it worth a read for fans of the genre.",

It creates a strong sense of unease and dread, keeping the reader guessing about the direction of the story until the very end. The atmosphere is unsettling, with a feeling that things are \"just … wrong,\" though it avoids outright terror.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The suspense is well-built, but the ending falls short of expectations. The reader anticipated a major showdown between Sol and the antagonist, but the climax \"fizzles out\" and transitions abruptly to the epilogue. While the twist at the end fits the story, the lack of a satisfying climax was disappointing.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters, particularly Veronica and the children, are described as \"the thing of nightmares\" and \"straight out of a M. Night Shyamalan film.\" Sol's character is well-developed, with her interactions and worldview informed by the book's social commentary.  \n\n- **Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel includes significant social commentary on racism and homophobia. While it feels \"a little heavy-handed at times,\" it effectively adds depth to Sol's character and her experiences.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Imagery:**  \n  The book is likened to a M. Night Shyamalan film, both in its unsettling tone and its twist ending. The reader humorously imagines Shyamalan directing a film adaptation and making his signature cameo as a paramedic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book excels in building suspense and creating a creepy, unsettling atmosphere, the ending lacks the climactic payoff the reader expected. The characters are memorable, and the social commentary adds depth, though it can feel heavy-handed at times. Overall, it’s a solid suburban horror novel that keeps readers uneasy and guessing, making it worth a read for fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars, rounded up.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nMany thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for providing an advance copy of this book. Its expected publication date is September 3, 2024."

Ultimately, the ending feels unsatisfying and leaves you uncertain about your emotions, which is disappointing.",

Their interracial and LGBTQ+ identities enrich the narrative, highlighting their struggle to find acceptance within the community. Sol's flaws and self-destructive behaviors make her a complex character, yet I found myself rooting for her as she navigates the challenges of preserving her marriage and her life.",

While I found her unmoored and clueless nature somewhat endearing, her overall character is frustrating. She struggles with crippling insecurity and a lack of responsibility, which prevents her from finding joy or growth throughout the narrative.",

Additionally, Sol, a Latina character, is unaware that quinoa has Latin American origins, which feels inconsistent with her background.",

The narrator's racism towards white people came across as excessive, leaving readers uncertain whether it was a character trait or a deliberate attempt to make white readers confront prejudice. Additionally, Sol's assertion that white people lack culture felt superficial and uninformed, as it overlooked the rich diversity within white cultures, such as German, Polish, and Russian."

            "This novel presents a slower-paced thriller, a departure from my usual preference for fast-paced narratives. Despite this, I found it enjoyable, leaning into a slow burn that effectively builds suspense. The story immerses readers in a creepy atmosphere, compelling them to keep reading to uncover the mystery. It follows Sol and Alice, who move into their dream home in a gated community, only to encounter a series of unsettling events. The neighborhood is unnervingly uniform, with identical houses and yards, except for Sol and Alice’s distinctive home, which sets them apart. What was meant to be a protective gate soon feels like a trap, and the neighbors seem to know too much about them. The homeowners' association becomes a central conflict, as the pressure to conform creates tension and unease for Sol and Alice.",

            "I discovered a compelling connection between the book and a recent episode of “Fear Thy Neighbor,” which also explores the dangers and conflicts associated with HOAs. This parallel added an intriguing layer of relevance to my reading experience."

Each chapter highlights the looming risk of job loss, but the narrative often veers off into trivial distractions, such as her neighbor's odd glances. This shift away from the central conflict is frustrating and detracts from the story's impact.",

Moreover, she absurdly assumes that her kind and helpful neighbors are only interested in harming her.\n\n**With Her Father:**  \nThe MC's father is a homophobic and abusive figure, yet she continues to visit him weekly, clinging to a single positive memory from the past. This refusal to sever ties with such toxicity is both illogical and frustrating.\n\n**With Her Wife:**  \nHer relationship with her wife is equally problematic.

Instead, it was a very bizarre and cultish read that made me feel like I was in an upside-down version of *The Stepford Wives* (literally thinking about *Stranger Things*).  \n\n- **Depth and Discussion Potential:**  \n  There is a lot to unpack here, and I think it would make a great pick for a book club discussion.  \n\n- **Audiobook Experience:**  \n  The audiobook was pretty meh for me. I wasn’t a huge fan of iiKane. She was okay most of the time, but other times her narration felt really disjointed. I think reading with the eyes would be a better route for some people. However, I will say she did an excellent job of capturing the characters’ various dialects throughout.  \n\n- **Ending and Ambiguity:**  \n  I had to listen to the last chapter a couple of times, and I still don’t think I fully understand what happened there. It’s not tied up in a pretty bow and felt rather ominous, but man, was it unique.  \n\n- **Future Interest in the Author:**  \n  I would definitely read more from Tirado.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thank you to the publishers for my advanced listening and reader copies of this book. All opinions and thoughts are my own.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *We Came to Welcome You* is an eerie, atmospheric, and thought-provoking novel with a cultish vibe and an ambiguous ending. While the audiobook narration had its flaws, the story itself is compelling and unique, making it a great choice for discussion. I look forward to reading more from Vincent Tirado.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The neighbors are depicted as overly involved and subtly hostile, adding to the story’s tension.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The novel explores themes of microaggressions, discrimination, and the challenges of fitting into a seemingly idyllic but insular community. The subtle and overt prejudices Sol and Alice face as a same-sex couple with different last names are highlighted effectively, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I found the story enjoyable and engaging, with a compelling mix of mystery and social commentary. The writing effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader invested in Sol’s journey. However, the clarity of the ending and the resolution of certain plotlines could have been improved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *We Came to Welcome You* offers an intriguing and suspenseful narrative with strong social commentary, the ending felt somewhat unclear, and some storylines lacked resolution. Despite these shortcomings, it was an enjoyable read that kept me engaged throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel opens with Sol and Alice settling into their new home in Maneless Grove, a gated community that soon unveils its sinister undercurrents. The neighborhood exudes a “Stepford Wives” meets “Children of the Corn” vibe, featuring strange, overbearing neighbors, zombie-like children, and a house that feels haunted. The story is both chilling and engrossing, with a slow build that immerses readers in its eerie atmosphere. While it lacks jump scares, it fosters a pervasive sense of dread that leaves you wanting to wrap yourself in a blanket for comfort.",
            "The strain in Sol and Alice's marriage is palpable as they navigate the unsettling atmosphere of Maneless Grove. Sol grapples with personal challenges, including her homophobic father, a career-threatening suspension, and a drinking problem, which heighten her paranoia about their home and neighborhood. In contrast, Alice dismisses Sol's fears, attributing them to her discomfort with social interaction and alcohol. Their differing cultural backgrounds—Sol hailing from the Dominican Republic and Alice from South Korea—add another layer of tension, particularly as Sol becomes increasingly aware of the racism and microaggressions in the community. Meanwhile, Alice's desire to fit in leads her to downplay her identity, further alienating Sol.",

While it may not deliver the same level of terror as some horror novels, its subtle creepiness and allegorical depth make it a compelling read.",
            "This book serves as a poignant allegory for systemic racism in the United States. Through symbols such as the white-barked Aspen trees that adorn every house except Sol's, alongside the overt racism and microaggressions he faces, the novel cleverly transforms bigotry into a horror narrative. By employing the horror genre, it effectively underscores the insidious nature of systemic racism, resulting in a story that is both chilling and thought-provoking."

The beginning was overly focused on rants and complaints, which detracted from the mystery's setup. While the ending was shocking and impactful, it lacked the climactic tension I had hoped for. \n\nI appreciated the plot's concept, which echoed themes from favorites like *The Stepford Wives*, *The Other Black Girl*, and *Get Out*. The claustrophobic setting, the enigmatic HOA, and the suburb's unsettling atmosphere—teetering between cult-like and horrific—were captivating. The supernatural elements, such as a missing stair and disappearing street blocks, added to the intrigue. The eerie children and the dead people they encountered kept me engaged, mirroring Sol’s obsession with uncovering the truth.",

As a seasoned editor, I see significant potential for growth in the author's craft. With continued effort, the author could become a notable figure in the genre.",
            "Sol's battle with mental illness and paranoia is vividly portrayed, evoking such intense anxiety that I often had to pause my reading due to discomfort.

The book also explores the challenges faced by people of color, though at times it felt repetitive and overly one-sided.",

The book also shed light on how people of color navigate life, though it sometimes felt repetitive and swung too wide in one direction.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book had great ideas, but they didn’t always mesh well together. I needed more from some areas, more answers to questions, and a better ending. The front end had too much ranting and complaining about others, and not enough time setting up the mystery. The ending, while shocking and appalling, didn’t feel like a big climax, though it was impactful in its own way.\n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  The writing did a good job of creating awareness and emotional impact, but the execution felt uneven. Some plot points needed deeper development to make the story shine more. As a longtime editor, I feel there’s room for growth in the author’s craft. Tirado has great potential and should become an accomplished author in the genre with more work.\n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  The book was complex, confusing, and confrontational, leaving me with a lot to think about. While it wasn’t perfect, it was a good read, and I’d recommend giving it a chance. I’m excited to see what story Tirado comes up with next and will definitely read their next book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had a compelling concept and strong emotional impact, but its execution felt uneven, with pacing issues and an ending that was both shocking and unsatisfying. Despite its flaws, it was thought-provoking and showcased the author’s potential. I look forward to seeing Tirado’s growth in future works.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nAverage rating for execution, with room for improvement."

            "I found the main character's journey, marked by internal and external monologues that challenge and reinforce her core beliefs, to be captivating. The ending was a masterful conclusion, showcasing the depth of character development. Sol faced a choice between being a victim or a perpetrator, carefully weighing her options to decide to live her life with her wife rather than succumb to the community's demands. The story's resolution was powerful and resonant, contrary to those who felt it fell flat; they simply missed the point.",
            "Many white individuals struggle to truly empathize with the experiences of people of color, particularly when it comes to code-switching, altering their personalities for safety, and discerning others' motives. This is not paranoia or a psychological horror; it is the genuine reality for people of color, especially those in the LGBTQIA+ community who do not conform to traditional feminine presentations, as they navigate a predominantly white society."

The ending was an immaculate wrap-up, showing the brilliance of the character development. Sol could choose to be a victim or a perpetrator, and she weighed her pros and cons to make the most valuable decision to live her life with her wife and not ultimately die and be fed upon by the community. It didn’t fizzle out, and the people saying so just didn’t get it.\n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I believe most white people cannot begin to empathize with the experience of being a person of color and having to code-switch, change your literal personality for the sake of safety, and assess people's underlying motives and intentions. That’s not paranoia or a psychological horror element; that is the TRUE lived experience of people of color, especially POC in the LGBTQIA+ community with non-feminine presentation, attempting to assimilate in a predominantly white society.\n\n- **Criticism of Other Reviews:**  \n  The people reviewing this book with low ratings are mostly white women claiming the main character is racist towards white people. That isn’t a thing and is a really ethnocentric, uncultured perspective.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a profound exploration of identity, survival, and the complexities of navigating a predominantly white society as a person of color.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story revolves around a lesbian couple moving into a new home in a seemingly perfect neighborhood. However, something feels off about the community, and the unsettling truth is revealed gradually throughout the book. The setting is described as overly perfect, with identical houses that contribute to the eerie atmosphere.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book creates a deeply creepy and unsettling vibe. The perfection of the neighborhood feels unnatural, and the slow reveal of the community’s secrets adds to the tension. The tone is consistently ominous, making the reader feel uneasy throughout.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Imagery:**  \n  The author’s writing is very visual, painting a clear picture of the neighborhood and its unsettling perfection. The description of the houses as “boxes made of ticky-tacky” (though the reader’s own words, not the author’s) highlights the uniformity and artificiality of the setting.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Familiarity:**  \n  The reader felt a sense of déjà vu, as if they had encountered a similar plot in another book but couldn’t recall the title. This familiarity didn’t detract from the experience but added an intriguing layer of mystery.  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  The book’s visual and suspenseful nature makes it well-suited for adaptation into a short-term TV series. The gradual reveal of secrets and the eerie atmosphere would translate effectively to the screen.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and unsettling read, with a perfectly crafted eerie atmosphere and a plot that keeps you on edge. Its visual storytelling and slow-burn tension make it a strong candidate for adaptation into a TV series. While the plot felt familiar in some ways, it didn’t diminish the overall impact of the story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The setting is described as unnervingly pristine, with eerie elements like disappearing stairs and walls that heal themselves. The gated community and intense homeowners association add to the unsettling atmosphere.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - **Sol Reyes:** The protagonist, a molecular biologist dealing with professional setbacks, personal struggles, and microaggressions as a queer Afro-Latina woman. She is smart, snarky, and relatable, with a sharp internal monologue.  \n  - **Alice Song:** Sol’s wife, who becomes increasingly eager to fit in with the neighbors, leading to a creepy transformation.  \n  - **Nadine:** A pregnant neighbor with a sinister, cult-leader-like influence.  \n  - **Finnian(s):** Multiple redheaded men whose identities are confusing and ambiguous.  \n  - **Veronica:** A creepy little girl who adds to the horror elements.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel explores heavy themes such as racism, microaggressions, the pressure to assimilate, queer identity, family acceptance, mental health, and addiction. These themes are woven into the horror narrative, though occasionally the messaging feels heavy-handed.\n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Tirado’s writing is punchy, darkly humorous, and peppered with sarcasm and pop culture references. The use of Spanish and Korean phrases adds authenticity to the characters’ backgrounds. However, the pacing is uneven, with a slow build in the first half and a rushed, hard-to-follow second half.\n\n- **Horror Elements:**  \n  The novel excels at building a slow-burn sense of dread, with unsettling descriptions of the neighborhood and its residents. The concept of a hive-mind entity that absorbs individuality is particularly unnerving. The bonfire scene is a standout moment of horror.\n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Vivid, unsettling descriptions of the neighborhood and its residents.  \n  - Sol’s complex, flawed, and relatable character.  \n  - Clever use of horror tropes to explore real-world issues.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Some secondary characters feel underdeveloped.  \n  - A few plot threads are left unresolved.  \n  - The ending, while shocking, may leave some readers unsatisfied.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"We Came to Welcome You\" is a bold and ambitious novel that blends psychological horror with social commentary.

The story uses horror to examine the erosion of autonomy and the fragility of identity under social scrutiny.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Sol Reyes is a deeply introspective protagonist whose skepticism and snark serve as her armor against systemic oppression and the eerie, invasive nature of her surroundings.

            "Sol and Alice are captivating characters who defy societal pressures to conform, seeking to live authentically in their new home. Sol’s experiences as a Black woman, often misunderstood and labeled as difficult, are depicted with depth and nuance. The novel skillfully contrasts the stereotypes and assumptions faced by both women, including their neighbors' misconceptions about their professional roles.",
            "The novel is exceptionally well-crafted, featuring strong pacing and sentence structure that captivates readers throughout.",
            "This novel adeptly examines both covert and overt racism, homophobia, and xenophobia, infused with a science fiction/horror twist reminiscent of Jordan Peele's work. It poignantly addresses the pressures of assimilation and the erosion of cultural identity through the experiences of Sol, a Dominican American, and Alice, a Korean American. Serving as a metaphor for contemporary American society, the story critiques systemic issues via a Homeowners Association (HOA) that enforces conformity among residents. It tackles microaggressions and bigotry, particularly highlighting the unique challenges faced by Black women like Sol. Additionally, the narrative underscores a socioeconomic metaphor, illustrating how status and wealth can grant acceptance—albeit only for those who align with dominant cultural norms.",

            "The story centers on Alice and Sol, who relocate to a suburban neighborhood plagued by intrusive neighbors and a domineering homeowners' association. Initially captivated by the allure of homeownership and a shift in status, they become increasingly oblivious to the lurking dangers. While the premise is compelling, the pacing drags, and the homeowners' association, as the primary antagonist, fails to instill the same level of fear as similar villains in other works.",

Her unusual work drama, lingering memories of familial trauma, and increasing awareness of her wife's changes make her a compelling character. However, the repetition of her memories occasionally detracts from her overall arc.",

While there are clear nods to both, this book lacks the magic and intensity that made those works so compelling.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The story follows Alice and Sol as they move to a suburban neighborhood with nosy neighbors and an aggressive homeowners' association. The promise of homeownership and a status shift distracts them from the growing dangers around them. While the concept is intriguing, the pacing feels slow, and the homeowners' association, as the central villain, doesn’t evoke the same level of fear as similar antagonists in other novels.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Sol takes center stage early on, and her journey is the highlight of the book. Her bizarre work drama, recurring memories of familial trauma, and growing awareness of changes in her wife make her a compelling character. However, her memories sometimes feel repetitive, which detracts from her overall arc.\n\n- **Personal Connection:**  \n  Having lived in a homeowners' association for 25 years (where it’s compulsory), I found myself fixated on the idea that Alice and Sol even had a choice to join. This made their situation feel less frightening compared to my own real-life experience.\n\n- **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  \n  The book has some sinister and chilling moments, and the concept is strong. However, it doesn’t fully deliver on its potential, as other works in the genre achieve similar goals with more vigor and impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Other Black Girl* and *Midsommar* set high expectations, this debut novel falls short of capturing their magic. Despite its engaging premise and a standout character in Sol, the slow pacing, repetitive elements, and less effective villainy make it a decent but not exceptional read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars  \n\n*Special thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for this arc, which I received in exchange for an honest review.

            "The story attempts to establish a creepy atmosphere through tone and vibe, but the writing ultimately falls short. While the author recognizes the unsettling nature of suburbs, the execution fails to deliver. Moments intended to evoke fear or creepiness miss the mark, which is disappointing given the setting's potential. Lacking the cinematic quality that authors like Stephen Graham Jones masterfully achieve, the narrative struggles to immerse the reader. As a result, many scenes that should have been impactful feel flat, acknowledging the creepiness without truly evoking it.",

It’s more of a thriller with horror undertones, which may not satisfy readers looking for a pure horror experience.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending left me confused, even after re-reading it. I felt like I missed something crucial, but it still didn’t make sense. The time skip at the end felt unnecessary and disrupted the pacing, leaving me unsatisfied and without the catharsis I expected.\n\n- **Tone and Atmosphere:**  \n  The story relies heavily on tone and vibe to create a creepy atmosphere, but the writing didn’t fully capture that. While the author clearly understands why suburbs can be unsettling, the execution fell short. Moments meant to be scary or creepy didn’t land, which was disappointing given the potential of the setting.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Tirado’s writing lacks the cinematic quality that authors like Stephen Graham Jones excel at. This made it harder to feel immersed in the story, and many scenes that should have been impactful felt flat. The writing acknowledges the creepiness without actually making the reader feel it.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The book is a mashup of *The Stepford Wives* and *Hot Fuzz* through a queer POC lens, which is refreshing. However, it leans more toward thriller with some horror elements rather than being straight-up horror. This left me a bit disappointed, as I was expecting a more intense horror experience.\n\n- **Character Development and Plot:**  \n  The protagonist, Sol, becomes increasingly angry as the plot unravels, which was engaging. However, the abrupt time skip at the end disrupted the narrative flow and left me feeling disconnected from the resolution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a lot of potential with its unique perspective and suburban horror premise, it ultimately fell short in execution. The ending was confusing, the tone didn’t fully deliver the intended creepiness, and the writing style lacked the immersive quality needed to make the horror elements effective. It’s more of a thriller with horror undertones, which may not satisfy readers looking for a pure horror experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The plot takes unexpected twists that keep the reader guessing and enhance the overall enjoyment. However, the ending feels abrupt, leaving me wishing for a more epic showdown between the protagonist and antagonist.",

It follows Sol, a Black Latina butch, and Alice, her Korean wife, as they navigate the predominantly white gated community of Maneless Grove. The themes of racism, microaggressions, and psychological tension are compelling and relevant.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  Sol’s anxiety and paranoia are central to the story, stemming from her professional struggles (false accusations and suspension) and the unsettling events in the neighborhood. However, her anxiety is introduced so early and emphasized so heavily that it overshadows other aspects of her character. Alice’s behavior changes rapidly, and while the reasons become clear later, the initial contention between her and Sol feels underdeveloped, leaving their relationship’s foundation weak for the reader.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story introduces intriguing elements like strange phenomena (a disappearing step, a shape-shifting neighbor, buzzing voices, dead-eyed children, and a burning corpse) that heighten the horror. However, the execution feels uneven, with tension that isn’t consistently built or sustained. The plot could have benefited from more editing to streamline the narrative and enhance its impact.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  While the characters, themes, and symbolism are strong, the novel reads more like a first draft. The story lacks the polish needed to make it succinct and cohesive. The tension and horror elements, though promising, don’t fully land due to inconsistent pacing and overemphasis on Sol’s anxiety.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*We Came to Welcome You* has a compelling premise and explores important themes, but its execution falls short. The characters and symbolism are strong, but the pacing, tension, and relationship dynamics needed more refinement to fully realize the story’s potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

It kept me engaged throughout, and as someone who has experienced the \"vice-like grip of an HOA,\" I could empathize with the characters Sol and Alice, which added a layer of real-life horror to the story.\n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The novel focuses on themes of race, sexual orientation, and mental health, creating a safe space for various groups to be seen and heard. While I appreciated this effort, I felt that these elements were sometimes overdone and felt forced, which detracted from the overall storyline.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**  \n  The ending felt a bit rushed, leaving me with many unanswered questions. I’m unsure if this was intentional, but it left me wanting more closure.\n\n- **Audience Suitability:**  \n  While the book was engaging, I couldn’t help but feel that I wasn’t quite the right audience for it. However, I still found it to be a compelling read.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  If you enjoy horror/thrillers that blend real, relatable fears with fictional elements reminiscent of *The Blair Witch Project* and *Midsommar*, I would recommend giving this book a try.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *We Came To Welcome You* is an engaging and atmospheric thriller that tackles important themes but occasionally struggles with pacing and overemphasis on certain elements. Despite some shortcomings, it’s a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story unfolded at a slow pace, lacking significant action throughout. Although the writing was strong, it fell short of creating the suspense and horror it promised. The narrative often shifted its focus to Sol's personal life, neglecting a deeper exploration of the unsettling elements of the community and its history.",
            "Set in the seemingly idyllic yet unsettling Maneless Grove, a gated community in Connecticut, the novel explores themes of conformity and control. The uniform houses, overly friendly neighbors, and a domineering HOA contribute to an atmosphere of unease. Eerie occurrences—such as disappearing steps, unnaturally growing roots, and children exhibiting synchronized, almost militaristic behavior—heighten the tension. While the story hints at the original cult behind the community, it offers little insight into its origins or history. A deeper exploration of these unsettling elements would have enriched the narrative and added intrigue.",

Although it shows promise as an HOA horror novel, it ultimately focuses more on personal drama than on horror."

            "I found the strange neighbors and eerie occurrences with the trees both intriguing and unsettling. I was fully engaged in uncovering the mystery, but the ending felt rushed and ultimately disappointing. I would have appreciated more explanation regarding the multiple Finnian characters and why he was the only one experiencing this duplication, as well as additional lore about the cult.",
            "Sol is a deeply problematic and toxic character, which can be quite frustrating. She often comes across as whiny and lacks genuine self-reflection; when she does reflect, it’s merely to wallow in self-pity without taking any steps to improve her situation. For instance, when she receives an email from Dr. Henderson inviting her to submit evidence for her hearing, she ignores it, choosing instead to focus on other distractions—only to later lament her circumstances. This missed opportunity highlights her lack of proactivity in salvaging her career. Additionally, her relationship with Alice appears toxic from the outset, further complicating her character dynamics.",

Despite these flaws, the novel had moments of brilliance in its creepy descriptions and unique premise.",

While Sol is reserved and uncomfortable with their overly friendly and intrusive neighbors, Alice, more sociable, adapts quickly but still feels the impact of the community's peculiarities. Tensions rise in their marriage due to Sol's forced sabbatical and accusations of plagiarism, compounded by the unsettling occurrences in Maneless Grove.",

They are one of my favorite fictional couples ever.  \n  - Vincent Tirado crafts such an authentic, likable, and relatable character in Marisol. Through her perspective, we get to know and understand Alice, rooting for them both as individuals and as a couple.  \n\n- **Genre Execution (Horror/Suspense):**  \n  - Not many suspenseful horror stories are filled with such depth, but the ones that are do it extremely well. *We Came to Welcome You* is one of those.  \n  - Horror lends itself to exploring the human psyche and groupthink in a way that other genres cannot, and Tirado digs into these themes with raw vigor.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  - Tirado manages to challenge readers’ views on sexism, racism, classism, and elitism.  \n  - The novel is a wonderful complement to one of my top 5 books read this year, Nicola Yoon’s *One of Our Kind*.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  - I did NOT see some of the twists coming. One, yes, but there’s so much more to it. If you read it, you’ll know why I enjoyed it so much!  \n\n- **Writing Style and Relevance:**  \n  - Tirado’s work is beautiful, propulsive, and relevant.  \n  - I look forward to reading much more of Tirado’s work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*We Came to Welcome You* is a deeply engaging and thought-provoking novel that excels in character development, genre execution, and social commentary. With its unexpected twists and relevant themes, it stands out as one of my favorite reads of the year.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Loved!!

While I understand that topics can be revisited, I believe this idea has been done better elsewhere.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sol):**  \n  I could not stand Sol, the protagonist whose perspective drives the story. Despite her traumatic experiences, she comes across as a miserable character, making it difficult to engage with the narrative through her lens.  \n\n- **Relationship Dynamics (Sol and Alice):**  \n  Sol and Alice’s relationship was deeply flawed. They clearly should not have been married, and their decision to buy a house to save their marriage felt unrealistic. There was zero chemistry between them, and the inclusion of random sex scenes felt forced and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Representation of Queer Relationships:**  \n  I would have loved to see a healthy queer couple represented, but this relationship fell far short of that ideal.  \n\n- **Potential vs. Execution:**  \n  Many aspects of the novel had potential but ultimately fell flat in execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some promising elements, it failed to deliver on its potential. The lack of originality, unlikable protagonist, and poorly executed relationship dynamics made it a disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5/5 ✨️"

The narrative dangled intriguing ideas but failed to deliver on them, leaving the reader feeling unsatisfied.\n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n  Despite considering not finishing the book (DNF), I pushed through to the end, only to be disappointed by the lack of a proper conclusion. The abrupt ending felt like a letdown after investing time in the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its intriguing ideas and well-established characters, the execution was severely lacking. The abrupt ending, missing 30 pages, left the story unresolved and the reader frustrated. The lack of closure and unanswered questions made the overall experience disappointing.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75 stars rounded up."

There were numerous unresolved threads and a lack of cohesion in tying the story together, which made it feel disjointed and incomplete.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the novel was intriguing and evoked a sense of nostalgia for a classic X-Files episode, the execution left much to be desired. The story suffered from poor pacing, excessive length, and a lack of resolution for key plotlines. With better editing and a tighter narrative, this could have been a much stronger read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 ⭐️"

It neither succeeds as a fun, pulpy read with meaningful social insights nor as a hard-hitting horror story. The attempt to straddle both genres results in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.\n\n- **Character Perspective:**  \n  Sol’s perspective is challenging to read, not because of her justified fears or complex emotions, but because of her slow realization of key plot points.

The idea of attacking HOAs, which definitely give cult vibes, was intriguing and unique.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  I appreciated the creepy, horror vibes throughout the story. The build-up to the reveal of what was truly happening in Maneless Grove was thrilling.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing of the book was very slow, which initially didn’t bother me as I expected it to pay off in the ending. However, the middle portion felt stagnant, with everything stalling, and the ending felt rushed.  \n\n- **Climax and Resolution:**  \n  The climax felt moot, especially with how the ending played out. The build-up didn’t deliver the satisfying payoff I was hoping for.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I wish we got more background on “The Neighbor” and how it came to be. Additionally, the romance between Alice and Sol felt underdeveloped. Their relationship didn’t seem romantic or loving; they came across more like friends or roommates than a married couple.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book had an intriguing concept and a strong atmosphere, but it was poorly executed. The slow pacing, stagnant middle, rushed ending, and underdeveloped relationships left me feeling unsatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
