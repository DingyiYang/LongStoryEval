            "In the final quarter of the book, the story took a disappointing turn. While I anticipated the twist, that wasn't my main concern. As a frequent reader of thrillers, I’ve come to expect some predictability, and I typically don’t fault authors for it. However, I was left feeling that this story had so much potential, and I was genuinely disappointed with the conclusion. I believe there were far better ways to end the narrative—options that wouldn't have involved misrepresenting mental health and illness. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75% of the book; the fast-paced, suspenseful, whodunit vibe felt like *Mean Girls* reimagined as a thriller, and I simply couldn’t put it down.",

The fast-paced, suspenseful, who-done-it nature felt like *Mean Girls* as a thriller. I could not put it down.\n\n- **Predictability of Plot Twist:**  \n  Around the last quarter of the book, things started to take a turn for the worse. I saw the twist coming from a mile away, but that wasn’t the main issue for me. As someone who reads a lot of thrillers, predictability happens, and I don’t usually hold that against the author.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  I really appreciated the centering around the harmful effects of bullying and the important issues surrounding it. The author depicted what high school bullying *can* look like really well.\n\n- **Depiction of Mental Health:**  \n  My main issue with this book is the depiction of the main character’s mental health near the ending. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth and honestly felt harmful (I’m intentionally keeping this vague to avoid spoilers). As someone who struggles with mental health, and having seen other reviewers bring this up, I’m not sure this was the best way to handle the ending.\n\n- **Potential and Ending:**  \n  This book had so much potential, and I’m bummed about how things wrapped up. I feel like there was absolutely a better ending—I can think of a few ideas myself—that did not weaponize or depict mental health and mental illness the way this novel ultimately did.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  While I loved the first part of the book, I’m still deciding if this is a book I would recommend or promote on my platform. For now, it’s an unfortunate miss for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book started strong with its fast-paced, suspenseful narrative and thoughtful exploration of bullying, but it faltered in its depiction of mental health and its ending.

Rather than actively involving readers in the investigation, Dawn presents clues in a convenient list, rendering the reveals redundant. Additionally, the twist at the end is both foreseeable and off-putting, failing to deliver the intended impact.",

The portrayal of teenage girls is stereotypical and unsympathetic, particularly in its treatment of sensitive issues like bullying and eating disorders.",

The dialogue lacks authenticity, making it hard to believe the characters are teenagers.

I predicted early on that I might not enjoy it, but I kept going.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending was in bad taste, especially for a YA novel. The message we were left with didn’t resonate with me. The resolution felt disjointed and made the rest of the book seem less impactful. For example, what happened with Isaac? It left me unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Twist and Predictability:**  \n  The twist was fine, and while I saw it coming, that wasn’t a major issue for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  The writing felt very juvenile, which didn’t align with the serious tone of the ending. This mismatch made the story feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Depiction of Bullying:**  \n  The portrayal of bullying felt off to me. There are many ways to depict bullying, but this one came across as cheap and not as impactful as it could have been.  \n\n- **Author’s Note:**  \n  I appreciated the author’s note, which was vulnerable and open about her personal experiences. No disrespect to the author, as her honesty was commendable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was fast-paced and easy to read, the ending, resolution, and juvenile writing style detracted from its overall impact.

I thought it was Brett or Raquel.  \n\n- **Realism and Relatability:**  \n   - The book was so realistic. This happens all the time at my school—not the murder, but the constant telling people they can or can't eat something, like \"I am so fat, I am not eating lunch,\" or if you look at someone the wrong way, they think you're checking them out.  \n\n- **Social Dynamics and Cliques:**  \n   - I agree with the portrayal of cliques. You can't be a popular kid who likes chess; you have to fit into one specific group. People will always pick the one that is not favored as much because people are mean and petty.  \n\n- **Advice for High Schoolers:**  \n   - My advice as someone in high school is to be yourself and not cause drama. Don’t shit-talk people, and don’t be nervous to talk to someone just because you’re worried about what others will think. Trust me, they’ll still have a negative attitude about you no matter what.  \n   - Just be yourself. You only have four years, and you’ll probably forget about most of these people afterward. Prioritize yourself and your grades. Keep your grades up, and don’t let people take advantage of your trust. If you say something, they might respond negatively, so just focus on you and your grades.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a great book, and I heavily enjoyed it.

The story began slowly but effectively built suspense, culminating in a genuinely surprising twist that felt neither cheesy nor contrived. This twist was one of the most impressive I’ve encountered in some time.",

            "This book delves into heavy themes such as murder, bullying, suicide, and mental illness, making it a challenging read that can elicit strong emotions. Content warnings are crucial, covering topics like lesbophobia, narcissism, car accidents, mental health struggles, fatphobia, and eating disorders. The narrative authentically portrays teenage angst and anxiety, honoring the depth of their struggles. A striking quote encapsulates this sentiment: “…everything that adults, with experience and hindsight, recognize as trivial can seem insurmountable to a teen. Like the end of the world.”",

            "The plot became more engaging around 30% into the book, yet the ending ultimately disappointed with its implausibility. The twist about the main character’s true identity and mental illness felt contrived, serving more for shock value than for narrative depth. However, the dual perspectives of the main character and Hannah were a highlight, keeping me invested in the story. The reliance on far-fetched elements, such as the protagonist undergoing plastic surgery at 18 for revenge, undermined the story's credibility. Additionally, the notion that two bullied girls in the same grade could lead to one committing suicide while only one is remembered strained believability.",
            "The main character's backstory and motivations are underdeveloped, making it difficult to connect with them. Additionally, the abrupt shift of a character into a homicidal figure, without any prior signs of mental illness, feels implausible. The secondary characters, such as Isaac's sister and Raquel, also lack depth and consistency. Furthermore, the exclusion of a second bullying victim, Dawn/Hannah, is a significant oversight in the narrative.",
            "The writing felt juvenile and cringe-worthy, even for a YA novel. Character descriptions, like “pretty Latina” and “Lululemon leggings,” came across as forced and unnecessary. The dialogue was poorly executed, which diminished the reading experience. However, the book had good pacing and was easy to read, allowing me to finish it in just two sittings.",
            "The author's exploration of mental illness and anti-bullying themes ultimately misses the mark. The depiction of schizophrenia and trauma is exaggerated and detrimental, casting the main character in an unrealistic and stigmatizing light. Additionally, the anti-bullying message lacks consistency; despite the protagonist's personal experiences with bullying, her failure to advocate for others, such as Raquel, comes across as weak and contradictory."

            "The connection between Hannah and Dawn was somewhat predictable, especially given the chapter titles that hinted at their relationship. The revenge plot—where a bullied victim adopts a new identity to seek vengeance—felt familiar, echoing themes from other stories. The unexpected shift to a horror/thriller tone during the climax altered the story's direction. \n\nCentering on a trio of evil cheerleaders who torment an outcast, the narrative blends elements of drama, murder mystery, and thriller/horror. Initially reminiscent of *Carrie*, *Mean Girls*, and *One of Us Is Lying*, it explores bullying and revenge. However, the sudden genre shift from teen drama/murder mystery to thriller/horror near the climax feels jarring. \n\nThe ending, with its cliffhanger, leaves room for interpretation, suggesting future developments while also allowing readers to envision the aftermath. However, the lack of resolution for Isaac and his sister's storyline feels unsatisfying and leaves some questions unanswered.",

He provides a realistic portrayal of high school social dynamics and bullying. The comparison to *Mean Girls* and *Pretty Little Liars* is apt, as the story revolves around a head cheerleader's murder and the motives of those around her. This aspect is well-executed by the author.  \n\n- **Mystery and Plot Twists:**  \n   - The mystery and twists in the story are effective, even though I guessed the ending relatively early. This did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the plot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Most characters are intentionally unlikable, which adds to the dark comedy and aligns with the story's tone. However, the lack of relatable or likable characters, including the main character (MC), made the book less accessible for me.  \n\n- **Mental Health Representation:**  \n   - The depiction of mental health struggles, including self-hatred, depression, bullying, suicidal ideations, and attempts, is excellent and deeply resonant, especially for someone who has experienced similar challenges. However, the ending takes the mental illness representation to an extreme, leaving me conflicted about its execution.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Personal Reception:**  \n   - As a young adult (YA) novel, it may resonate more with its intended teenage audience.

The portrayal of stereotypical mean cheerleaders felt a bit clichéd, but it effectively highlighted the bullying dynamics in high school settings.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book delves deeply into the pervasive issue of bullying, exploring its various forms—physical, verbal, and cyber. This theme resonated strongly with me, as it reflects the harsh realities many face in high school. The story effectively conveys how bullying can have devastating consequences, both for the victims and the perpetrators.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  Despite some minor gripes, I tore through the book in a day. The pacing was excellent, and the mystery kept me turning the pages. While it wasn’t a brain-teaser, the emotional depth and social commentary made it a memorable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Perfect Little Monsters* is a gripping high school mystery that tackles the serious issue of bullying with emotional depth. While the main character’s choices and some clichéd elements were minor drawbacks, the engaging plot and impactful themes made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

The jumping back-and-forth between Dawn and Hanna's point of view seemed weird and random.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The way the story unfolded was fantastic. The plot twist that Dawn and Hanna are actually the same person and that is why we were jumping between their points of view was unexpected and brilliantly executed.  \n\n- **Character Development and Revelations:**  \n  I was not expecting that Dawn was the killer. I had my suspicions that her actions were strange, like when she confronted people without recording it or being honest. However, it all made sense later because she was actually the killer. Providing evidence would have led the police closer to her, which she obviously wanted to avoid.  \n\n- **Narrative Cohesion and Resolution:**  \n  The way everything came together at the end was shocking and satisfying. I was definitely not expecting that Hanna and Dawn were the same person. I kept thinking Hanna was Isaac's sister and that we were hearing her story, not Dawn's original life.  \n\n- **Replay Value and Reflection:**  \n  If I could go back and relisten, I wish I could see if I could pick up on the clues knowing what was going to happen. I am still so shocked at how it all came together.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was incredibly thought-provoking and kept me engaged despite my initial uncertainty. The unexpected plot twist and the way the narrative tied together at the end were masterfully done. It left me reflecting on the story long after finishing it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was no support or help offered to the character afterward, and she referred to herself as \"crazy\" and \"insane\" for her mental health struggles.  \n   - While I understood the author’s perspective better after reading the author’s note, I wish more had been said about the broader mental health issues portrayed in the book.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Bullying:**  \n   - The book depicts pretty horrific bullying, with the bullies clearly framed as the villains.

I read it in 3 days, and that’s mostly because I didn’t have enough time to read on the second day.  \n\n- **Structure and Format:**  \n  The story is told in dual timelines, which added depth to the narrative. There are trigger warnings at the front of the book, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  This was a revenge story where every character had a motive. It felt like *Mean Girls* with all the drama and cliques, but with murder added to the mix.  \n\n- **Twists and Surprises:**  \n  The twist was incredible—I didn’t see it coming until a little bit before the end when things started to click and make sense. Even when I got to the reveal, I still couldn’t believe it.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was my favorite part, though I know some people might prefer a happier conclusion.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  There wasn’t a single thing I didn’t like about this book. If you enjoyed *A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder* or *One of Us Is Lying*, I highly recommend giving this a read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute page-turner with a gripping plot, well-executed twists, and a satisfying (if not entirely happy) ending. I can’t wait to read more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, it falls into predictable YA tropes, offering one of three common endings:  \n  1. The issues are resolved through magic.  \n  2. The character is institutionalized and forced to take medication.  \n  3. The character’s identity is completely redefined, revealing they were never who we thought they were.  \n  I wish the story had portrayed mental health in a way that normalized dealing with it without immediately resorting to medication or fantastical solutions. Breaking the stigma around mental health in literature requires more nuanced and realistic portrayals.  \n\n- **Ending and Plot Twist:**  \n  The big reveal felt predictable and disappointing. It followed a formulaic approach that undermined the potential for a more impactful and authentic resolution.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Similar Books:**  \n  If you enjoyed *We’ll Never Be Apart* by Emiko Jean or *Twisted Fate* by Norah Olson, you might find this book appealing, as it shares similar themes and narrative styles.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book tackles mental health, it relies on overused YA tropes that detract from its potential to offer a meaningful and realistic portrayal.

            "This novel is a fast-paced psychological thriller that alternates between the perspectives of Hannah and Dawn, who grapple with their personal struggles while confronting the murder of their cheer captain, Ella. The first three-quarters of the book are engaging, featuring a well-crafted mystery that kept me guessing. However, the final quarter feels disjointed, as if it were two different stories merged together, which disrupts the overall flow and tone. The central mystery of Ella’s murder is compelling, with various suspects and motives. While I successfully predicted some twists—without diminishing my overall enjoyment—the resolution felt less surprising. Ultimately, the ending lacks the tonal consistency and satisfying conclusion that characterized the earlier parts of the story.",
            "Hannah, a freshman eager to fit in and please her parents, and Dawn, a senior grappling with a traumatic past, are well-developed and relatable protagonists. Ella, the cheer captain, along with her mean girl trio, serves as formidable antagonists, pushing others to their limits and creating a compelling dynamic. The supporting characters, including Ella’s vengeful boyfriend and envious best friend, enrich the narrative with added depth to the mystery and cast of suspects.",

It was a gripping read that kept me hooked from start to finish.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  I’m not a huge fan of YA fiction now as an adult, but for what it’s intended to be, it was a great book. It successfully captured the essence of a mystery thriller with a good twist I didn’t see coming.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book tackled an important conversation about how impactful bullying (or harassment, more accurately) can be. It also effectively portrayed the high emotions and intensity of being a teenager.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  I really loved how the author led us to believe that Hannah was Isaac’s sister, only to reveal that it was Dawn all along. While it was a bit hard to believe that she transformed herself so much and even changed her name, I understand it was all for the thrill of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an engaging and thought-provoking read that delivered a thrilling mystery with a surprising twist. Despite some minor disbelief about certain plot elements, it was a well-crafted story that effectively explored important themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This book kept me on the edge of my seat with its twists and moments that had me exclaiming, “Wait, WHAT??”  \n  - While I can usually deduce the killer before it’s revealed, this one had me guessing until the very end.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - I found myself sympathizing with the murderer because Ella Moore deserved her death and more. She was an absolutely TERRIBLE human being, and the more I read, the more I felt this way.  \n  - Dawn was a standout character for me. She was so complex, and I couldn’t fully pin her down until the very end.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story was engaging and full of twists that kept me hooked.  \n  - I do wish we had seen more of the relationship between Dawn and Issac, especially towards the end. It would have been interesting to see Issac’s reaction to the killer being identified.  \n\n- **Author and Acknowledgments:**  \n  - Thank you to Sourcebook Fire and Cindy R.X. He for gifting me a copy of this book in exchange for a review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was one of the best I’ve ever read and a fantastic start to my 2025 reading journey. It delivered a gripping YA murder mystery with well-developed characters, unexpected twists, and a morally complex narrative. While I would have liked more exploration of certain relationships, the story kept me thoroughly engaged and left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
