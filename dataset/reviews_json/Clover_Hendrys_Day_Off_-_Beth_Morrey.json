        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n   - The novel is a middle-aged, feminine version of *Ferris Bueller’s Day Off*, where the protagonist, Clover Hendry, decides to take a day off for herself after years of people-pleasing and suppressing her desires.  \n   - The story begins with Clover, a perimenopausal woman, taking expired Vicodin and antihistamines to cope with a migraine and an overwhelming to-do list, which leads to her uncharacteristic decision to prioritize herself for a day.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n   - Clover’s journey resonated deeply with me, as her struggles with societal expectations of womanhood and motherhood felt painfully familiar. Her reflections on her life—her narcissistic mother, her father’s abandonment, her disastrous wedding, and the challenges of motherhood—were raw and relatable.  \n   - I found myself reflecting on moments in my own life where I’ve allowed fear and the desire to avoid conflict to dictate my actions, much like Clover.  \n   - However, some of Clover’s choices and actions during her “day off” felt extreme and unrelatable, to the point where I wanted to argue with her or question her decisions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - Beth Morrey’s writing is sharp, witty, and infused with sarcasm, which perfectly complements Clover’s character.  \n   - The humor in the book, particularly in the absurd and over-the-top moments (like Clover driving a riding lawn mower through a group of yoga practitioners), had me laughing out loud.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n   - The book explores themes of self-discovery, breaking free from societal expectations, and the courage it takes to stand up for oneself.  \n   - Clover’s journey is both cathartic and empowering, especially for readers who have felt trapped by their own people-pleasing tendencies.  \n   - The ending, where Clover begins to embrace her newfound assertiveness, is beautifully written and emotionally satisfying.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n   - The story’s ability to evoke strong emotional reactions—whether it was relating to Clover’s struggles or wanting to argue with her choices—is a testament to its compelling narrative and character development.  \n   - The book encourages readers to reflect on their own lives and consider the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Clover Hendry’s Day Off* is a bold, humorous, and deeply relatable exploration of self-discovery and breaking free from societal expectations. While some of Clover’s actions may feel extreme, her journey is ultimately empowering and cathartic. Beth Morrey’s sharp writing and Clover’s wit make this a memorable and thought-provoking read, especially for anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed by the demands of life and the pressure to please others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel, inspired by *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, follows Clover Hendry, a 46-year-old TV executive producer who takes a day off to act freely, unencumbered by fear or hesitation. Clover's choices, particularly her revenge-driven whims, prompt reflection on whether her day off is a liberating escape or merely a façade for vengeance. While the idea of a fear-free day is both captivating and relatable, Clover's approach often feels excessive. The subplot involving revenge is exaggerated, yet it allows Clover to confront lingering regrets and grievances.",
            "**Clover Hendry (MFC)** is a burnt-out people-pleaser navigating perimenopause and a midlife crisis. Her behavior on her day off often comes across as mean and disrespectful, particularly towards her colleagues. **Robbie**, her husband, is a biking lawyer, while their 16-year-old twins, **Hazel** and **Ethan**, add to the family dynamic. **Susie**, Clover's best friend, provides support, contrasting with **Rose**, Clover's judgmental mother. **Marigold/Maz**, Clover's younger sister, struggles with anxiety stemming from their mother's dismissive nature and has secretly married **Calum Fraser**. **Vincent**, Clover's boss, adds to her workplace challenges, while a rabbit named **Bigwig**, which Clover gifts to her mother, symbolizes her attempts to connect despite the tension.",

Some segments felt disjointed, rushed, or extraneous, detracting from the overall narrative flow.",

            "Clover Hendry is a character plagued by irrational fears, living under the weight of her anxieties and the expectations of others. After taking potentially expired medication and suffering a minor head injury, her inhibitions vanish. Initially, Clover's transformation is entertaining; she speaks her mind, quits her job, and engages in behavior she would typically avoid. Her antics become increasingly wacky and humorous throughout the day. However, as the story unfolds, Clover's demeanor darkens—she becomes meaner and seeks revenge in increasingly public ways. This shift makes it difficult to relate to her, and the humor dissipates. The inclusion of a gay side character adds some representation to the narrative.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Initial Impressions and Expectations:**\n   - I picked up this book because of the bunny on the cover, even though he looks haughty and gives major side-eye. However, I don’t recommend reading this book for the rabbit, as he only appears halfway through.\n\n- **Character Development (Clover Hendry):**\n   - Clover Hendry is a character with numerous irrational fears, living her life constrained by these fears and others' expectations. After taking potentially expired medication and suffering a minor head injury, her inhibitions disappear.\n   - Clover’s transformation is entertaining at first, as she says what’s on her mind, walks out of her job, and behaves in ways she never would before. Her antics escalate throughout the day, becoming increasingly wacky and humorous.\n   - However, as the novel progresses, Clover takes a darker turn, becoming meaner and seeking revenge in very public ways. This shift makes it harder to identify with her, and the humor fades.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The novel takes place within 24 hours, which provides more than enough plot. The story is character-driven, with Clover’s progression and relationships at its core.\n\n- **Themes and Tone:**\n   - The book starts as a humorous, grown-up Ferris Bueller-like story but transitions into darker territory as Clover’s actions become more extreme and less relatable.\n\n- **Representation:**\n   - There is a gay side character, adding some representation to the story.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**\n   - The novel includes themes of homophobia, animal cruelty, dysfunctional family dynamics, and sexual harassment.\n\n- **Practical Advice (Bunny Care):**\n   - Clover isn’t a good bunny mom, so readers shouldn’t emulate her if they want a pet rabbit. In fact, her behavior is not something to emulate at all if one values their job, friends, and freedom.\n\n- **Target Audience:**\n   - Recommended for readers who enjoy character-driven novels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis novel is a mix of humor and darkness, centered around Clover Hendry’s transformation over 24 hours. While it starts as an entertaining and wacky journey, it takes a darker turn that may alienate some readers. The story is character-driven, with Clover’s relationships and progression at its heart. However, her actions and the novel’s themes come with significant content warnings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5 stars, rounded up."

Her behavior, such as bullying other women (her mother and colleague) and making derogatory comments about women practicing yoga, made it hard to sympathize with her.  \n  - Her sister, Maz, was one of the most sympathetic characters, providing a stark contrast to Clover's unrepentant attitude.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Clover's growth felt insufficient. While she eventually apologizes to her colleague and reconciles with her mother, her last-minute attempts at amends didn’t feel impactful enough to redeem her unlikeable behavior.  \n  - Her justification for her actions, claiming \"everyone has a quota of this kind of behavior,\" felt weak and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Execution of Concept:**  \n  - The concept of standing up for oneself and embracing self-care was intriguing, but the execution fell short. Clover's selfishness and lack of self-awareness overshadowed the potential message.  \n  - The book’s exploration of body image and motherhood felt unbalanced, with Clover demonizing certain body types and lifestyles while glorifying her own.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement:**  \n  - The writing style was inconsistent, with moments that made me consider DNFing (like Clover referring to her vulva as her \"foo-foo\").  \n  - I skipped several chapters when the story became boring, though not consecutively.  \n\n- **Handling of Themes:**  \n  - The book attempted to address themes like body positivity and self-acceptance but ended up reinforcing stereotypes and judgments.  \n  - The portrayal of motherhood and childfree lifestyles felt divisive rather than inclusive.  \n\n- **Miscellaneous Observations:**  \n  - The rabbit subplot felt unnecessary and uncomfortable, especially with the animal being treated as a cute accessory rather than a living being.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting premise about self-empowerment and self-care, the execution was flawed.

A central theme is her tumultuous relationship with her dismissive and hypercritical mother, which propels her journey toward independence. Clover's character is further enriched by her ultra-supportive husband, her 16-year-old twins, who are generally likable, and a few good friends.

            "In this story, we follow Clover Hendry, a 46-year-old married mother of two working in the TV industry, who decides to take a day for herself, stepping away from her people-pleasing tendencies to voice her true thoughts. The premise is reminiscent of *Ferris Bueller’s Day Off*, but with a perimenopausal woman as the main character. While I expected more wild escapades, the narrative focuses on Clover seeking revenge on those who have wronged her. One of my main concerns is the lack of comeuppance for Clover; although there are apologies, they don't fully address the repercussions of her actions. The ending left me wanting more resolution, as several loose ends remained untied.",
            "Clover resonates deeply with women her age, capturing the frustration of feeling exploited and the yearning to assert herself. While her actions may occasionally veer into mean-spiritedness or even criminality, they appear justified by her emotional turmoil and mounting resentment. I found myself vicariously experiencing her journey, contemplating the freedom of acting on similar frustrations.",
            "The book turned out to be more complex than the lighthearted romp I initially anticipated, yet I still found it enjoyable. While some of Clover’s antics may polarize readers, I embraced them as a whimsical \"what if\" fantasy rather than a realistic depiction. The tone skillfully balances humor with darker, cathartic moments, resulting in a uniquely engaging read."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I had a pretty good time with this book. While it wasn’t the madcap adventure I anticipated, it offered a cathartic and relatable experience, especially for women in their 40s. I would recommend it to readers who enjoy living vicariously through a character’s bold, albeit controversial, actions.",

Usually, they were the right and only choices at the time, no matter where they led you.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Clover's journey is compelling as she decides to put off the pressures of being a great mom, daughter, and worker to have her own personal \"yes day.\" It's great that when she does what she really wants, it's not grand things but rather small, meaningful actions she had put off for \"some day.\"  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  I liked the back-and-forth between the present and past experiences of Clover. This structure adds depth to her character and highlights her growth throughout the story.  \n\n- **Plot Progression:**  \n  I wasn't really sure where the story would go until closer to the end, which kept me engaged.

Some of her choices, particularly her tendency to blame her parents—first her mother, then her father—rather than taking responsibility for her emotions, came across as extreme and unkind.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n   - Clover, a 46-year-old woman, is portrayed as someone who initially seems to have everything under control but eventually spirals into irrational, childish, and extreme behavior due to her struggles with perimenopause.  \n   - While her actions felt real and authentic, I found it difficult to relate to her experiences and feelings, especially as the story progressed.  \n   - Some of her actions came across as extreme and mean, particularly her tendency to blame her parents (first her mom, then her dad) instead of taking responsibility for her own emotions.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story started strong, but halfway through, it became harder to follow. This might have been due to my inability to connect with Clover’s journey.  \n   - The last chapters, however, were more engaging, especially when Clover’s Vicodin use began to take effect. These moments added a layer of humor and bravery to her character.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book tackles themes of self-discovery, accountability, and the chaos of midlife struggles.  \n   - While I cringed at some of Clover’s decisions, I appreciated her eventual bravery in staying true to herself and addressing the chaos she created.  \n   - The emotional resolution, though satisfying, was hard-earned and left me with mixed feelings.  \n\n- **Parental Relationships and Accountability:**  \n   - Clover’s relationship with her parents is a central focus, but her refusal to take responsibility for her own actions and her tendency to blame them felt frustrating.  \n   - While her parents weren’t perfect, I felt Clover could have benefited from therapy to address her unresolved issues rather than projecting her rage onto them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a raw and realistic portrayal of a woman navigating perimenopause and midlife chaos. While Clover’s journey is authentic and at times humorous, her extreme actions and lack of accountability made it challenging for me to fully connect with her story.

The timeline and timing were so unrealistic that it completely pulled me out of the story and made me lose interest.  \n\n- **Character and Animal Representation:**  \n  As someone who owns two rabbits, I found the portrayal of Bigwig, the rabbit, highly unrealistic. Clover carried him around in a backpack all day, handed him off to people, left him in random rooms, and let him roam without eating hay, veggies, or even drinking water. This depiction was completely implausible and added to my dissatisfaction with the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Clover Hendry's Day Off* was an uninteresting and unrealistic read for me.

However, I didn’t find it as hilarious as others have claimed—I never laughed out loud once.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I found the main character, Clover Hendry, to be annoying, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  While I’m not mad that I read it, I wouldn’t say it left a strong impression or exceeded my expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel served as a decent distraction during a long drive, but it didn’t live up to the hype of being laugh-out-loud funny for me. Clover Hendry’s character was more irritating than endearing, and while I don’t regret reading it, it didn’t leave a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nRounded down from 3.5 stars."
