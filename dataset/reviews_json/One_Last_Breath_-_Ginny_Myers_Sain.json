            "The story follows Tru, who becomes personally invested in the unsolved murders of two teenage girls, Bailey and Celeste. As she investigates, a cryptic note reading \"Don't fear the reaper\" and unsettling events hint at someone trying to conceal the truth. The plot is rich with intrigue and danger as Tru and Rio dig deeper into the cold cases, revealing details that only the victims could have known.",
            "Tru is a multifaceted protagonist navigating personal loss, a struggling relationship, and a strong desire for truth. Rio, a mysterious character, quickly forms a deep bond with Tru, leading their connection to evolve beyond mere friendship. The supporting cast features a range of townsfolk with quirky names, enhancing the small-town atmosphere, though it can occasionally feel overwhelming. The teenage characters embody typical adolescent behavior, focusing on smoking, relationships, and drama, which may not resonate with all readers. The developing romance between Tru and Rio serves as a significant subplot, adding emotional depth to the narrative, but it may not appeal to those who prefer thrillers devoid of romantic elements.",
            "Set against the backdrop of sunny Florida, the story vividly portrays the oppressive humidity and the menacing depths of the waters where much of the action unfolds. The immersive underwater scenes evoke a palpable sense of tension and suspense."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author delivers a theatrical and accessible YA thriller with *Don't Fear the Reaper*. The story is rich in atmosphere, with a compelling mystery and complex characters. However, the large cast of quirky townsfolk and the emphasis on teenage drama may detract from the main plot for some readers. The paranormal elements are intriguing but understated, and the resolution may leave some readers wanting more. Despite these minor drawbacks, the book is an engaging read, especially for fans of YA thrillers with a touch of romance.",

The notion that Rio and Tru were long-lost lovers murdered by a serial killer in a past life was hard to accept, especially since everyone around them embraced it without question. This unrealistic premise overshadowed the plot. The romance between Tru and Rio came across as rushed and unpersuasive. Tru's decision to break up with her caring boyfriend, who had a solid future planned, simply because Rio convinced her they were soulmates from a past life was disappointing. The boyfriend's subsequent murder added unnecessary tragedy to an already weak love story.",

The boyfriend stands out as a sympathetic figure, deserving better, as his genuine love for Tru and tragic fate overshadow the main characters. The other friends, who blindly accept the reincarnation story and assist in solving past life murders, come across as underdeveloped and unrealistic. Additionally, Rio and Tru's constant interruptions during conversations with suspects are irritating, and their cocky attitude and refusal to listen to others make them unlikable and hard to root for."

This left me feeling that the conflicts were not genuinely resolved by the end of the novel, which was disappointing. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the twist revealing Reese as the serial killer; it was executed exceptionally well.",

While it was slightly predictable in that I guessed, or had an inkling anyway, of who the killer was going to be, it turned out to be the case in a way that I was completely not expecting, so I was still surprised by the ending.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Tension:**  \n  This was really creepy and tense—you really just felt like the killer was around every corner, and I was so on edge the whole time! The book also felt really claustrophobic throughout, which I loved, with the small town vibes, the gators, the diving, the humidity, and the grief hovering over the town as well.\n\n- **Underrated Status of the Author:**  \n  I really think this author's books are very underrated!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGinny Myers Sain delivers another gripping and atmospheric novel with a supernatural twist.

            "This novel is a thrilling whodunnit with an intriguing paranormal twist and a sapphic romance. It follows Tru as she investigates the gruesome murders of two girls that took place 20 years ago in her hometown of Mount Orange, Florida. The mystery is captivating, keeping readers guessing about every character's motives. However, the middle of the book tends to drag, becoming repetitive with scenes of Tru kissing her boyfriend while contemplating Rio, free diving, or expressing disdain for tourists. This repetition undermines the story's overall momentum.",
            "The sapphic romance between Tru and Rio offers a refreshing distraction from the suspense, but the depth of their relationship and individual characters is lacking. Some interactions, such as openly accusing others of murder or introducing unprovable paranormal elements, come off as awkward and cringe-worthy.",

            "The book delves into themes of grief, guilt, and self-blame, offering a profound exploration that is somewhat overshadowed by the final reveal. Tru's coming-of-age journey and her struggle to balance her desires with societal expectations add significant emotional depth to the narrative."

Despite its strengths, these flaws prevent it from being a standout read.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n   - The novel is a thriller with a classic whodunnit plot, an interesting paranormal twist, and a sapphic romance.  \n   - The story revolves around Tru, who investigates the gruesome murders of two girls that occurred 20 years ago in her hometown, Mount Orange, Florida.  \n   - The mystery is intriguing, with a wild ride that keeps you questioning every character.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The environmental settings are vividly described, making the Florida summer humidity and the cool springs almost tangible.  \n   - The author effectively creates a sense of fear, particularly with the depiction of gators (or crocodiles) waiting at the springs at night.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The book explores themes of grief, guilt, and self-blame, which are deeply examined but somewhat overshadowed by the final reveal.  \n   - Tru’s coming-of-age journey and her struggle to reconcile her desires with societal expectations add emotional depth.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - The sapphic romance between Tru and Rio is a welcome distraction from the suspense.  \n   - However, the relationship between Tru and Rio, as well as their individual characters, was hard to fully connect with.  \n   - Some interactions, like openly accusing people of murder or revealing unprovable paranormal elements, felt awkward and cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetitiveness:**  \n   - The middle of the book drags and becomes repetitive, with scenes of Tru kissing her boyfriend while thinking about Rio, free diving, or hating tourists.  \n   - This repetition detracts from the overall momentum of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Breath* by Ginny Myers Sain is a thriller with a compelling mystery, rich atmospheric settings, and a sapphic romance. While the exploration of grief and self-discovery adds depth, the pacing suffers from repetitiveness in the middle, and the characters’ relationships and actions sometimes feel unconvincing. Despite its strengths, these flaws prevent it from being a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The reader is reminded repeatedly by multiple characters, including Tru as the narrator, that Rio is a liar, yet we are expected to believe everything she says. This makes me wonder what nefarious plans she has for Tru and who Rio really is.  \n\n- **Protagonist's Personality:**  \n  Tru came across as selfish and reserved despite growing up in a supposedly small town.

The wilderness of the springs adds a haunting backdrop to the story, especially with the dangerous hobby of free diving that Tru, Rio, and other locals engage in.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story revolves around the unsolved murders of two teen girls nearly two decades ago, and as the 20th anniversary approaches, Tru and Rio dig into the cold case. The plot is gripping, with plenty of twists, turns, and reveals, especially in the last 40% of the book. The threats they receive as they uncover new evidence heighten the tension, making it a perfect summer thriller.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Tru and Rio are compelling amateur sleuths with an inexplicable connection to the murder victims, including shared memories of events they couldn’t have experienced. Their relationship evolves alongside the investigation, with a rising attraction between them. Tru’s local friends also play a role, trying to dissuade her from investigating, which adds depth to her character and the story.  \n\n- **Suspense and Mystery:**  \n  The author creates numerous possible suspects, keeping the reader guessing until the end. The combination of violence, reveals, and the eerie setting makes the mystery both thrilling and unsettling.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook, narrated by Sophie Amoss, is exceptional. Her performance captures Tru’s youth, vulnerability, and determination perfectly. Her southern accents are well-executed, and her portrayal of Rio’s slow, sultry accent is convincing. She effectively conveys the anxiety, fear, and terror of the characters, enhancing the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*One Last Breath* is a captivating summer thriller with a richly atmospheric setting, a gripping plot, and well-developed characters. The combination of mystery, suspense, and a touch of the mystical makes it a standout read. The audiobook narration by Sophie Amoss adds an extra layer of immersion, making it a highly enjoyable experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The backstory of Bailey and Celeste's murder was skillfully crafted, creating a haunting atmosphere that heightened the story's tension. The cold case aspect effectively loomed over the town, enhancing the overall suspense. The free diving subplot introduced a unique and eerie element, perhaps intensified by my own fear of the depths. While the killer's identity was somewhat predictable, the motive was surprising and added depth to the narrative. Overall, the cold case storyline was more compelling and well-developed than the present-day narrative, which felt comparatively weaker.",

However, her poor communication skills often hinder empathy, as many of her issues appear self-inflicted. The relationship between Tru and Rio feels forced and lacks chemistry; without the paranormal elements, their bond would be unconvincing."

The paranormal connection between Tru and Rio was the only thing that held their relationship together, as their chemistry was otherwise lacking.",

This setup was intriguing and held a lot of potential. However, the execution fell flat, especially with the introduction of the paranormal past lives aspect, which felt unnecessary and diminished the story's impact.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tru's character was compelling in the first quarter to third of the book, but her depth and agency were undermined by the past life explanation, which felt like a cheap way to justify her actions and emotions. Rio, on the other hand, was thoroughly unlikeable. She came across as a liar and untrustworthy, making it hard to care about her perspective or her supposed connection to the murders.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The instalove romance between Tru and another character felt forced and poorly developed. It not only disrupted the main narrative but also served as a weak justification for breaking up Tru's existing relationship.  \n\n- **Mystery Resolution:**  \n  The resolution of the murders was disappointing. Instead of a well-crafted, logical conclusion, it devolved into shouting accusations at everyone, which felt lazy and unsatisfying for a mystery novel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book started with a promising premise and an intriguing connection to Tru's personal history, it ultimately failed to deliver.

Her personal connection to tragedy, stemming from the loss of her sister Dani, intensifies her fixation on the case. The story takes a thrilling turn when Trulee partners with Rio, an outsider, to uncover the truth, only to realize that the killer is still active and now targeting them.

Trulee serves as a compelling protagonist, motivated by guilt and curiosity, while her deep, almost mystical connection with Rio adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.

            "The central mystery surrounding the murders of Bailey and Celeste serves as a compelling backdrop, enhanced by Tru's personal connection to the case stemming from her grief over her sister's death. However, the supernatural twist involving Tru and Rio's reincarnated link to the murdered girls is intriguing yet unevenly developed. The story would have benefited from a deeper exploration of the supernatural elements or a more skeptical response from the characters. The final act feels rushed and chaotic, with high stakes diminished by a lack of real consequences for the characters' actions. While the free-diving scenes are unique and thrilling, their impact is diluted by the ambiguity of the paranormal experiences. Ultimately, the narrative's failure to provide a clear explanation for the supernatural elements leaves key scenes unresolved and confusing.",
            "Tru’s relationship with Rio serves as the emotional core of the story, often overshadowing her interactions with East. Tru's indifference and emotional unavailability toward East hinder empathy for her character. This imbalance detracts from the potential depth of their relationship. East’s storyline is particularly problematic; his willingness to support Tru despite her treatment of him feels unrealistic. His abrupt, tragic end appears unnecessarily cruel and undermines the novel’s LGBTQ+ representation. Overall, the uneven character development suggests the author struggled to balance romance and mystery, sacrificing meaningful growth for dramatic effect.",
            "The writing is engaging, and the atmosphere is immersive. Despite its flaws, the novel provides a compelling exploration of grief, love, and the hidden darkness within a seemingly idyllic town. Recommended for fans of supernatural thrillers set in rural Florida, it occasionally struggles to fully realize its ambitious themes.",
            "The depiction of Mount Orange, Florida, is both refreshing and authentic, beautifully capturing the haunting allure of its springs alongside the eerie atmosphere of a town weighed down by its dark history. The familiar settings added a personal touch to the reading experience."

        "conclusion": "*One Last Breath* is a flawed but engaging supernatural thriller that excels in its atmospheric setting and compelling central mystery. While the uneven development of its supernatural elements, imbalanced character dynamics, and rushed resolution detract from its potential, the novel remains an intriguing exploration of grief, love, and the darkness lurking beneath the surface of a small town.",

            "The plot unfolds as a slow burn, especially in the romance and action segments, which can feel overly drawn out at times. The ending, in contrast, feels rushed, leaving some details unclear and confusing. While the twists are well-executed, they could have been better distributed throughout the narrative. Additionally, the presence of emotional cheating is frustrating; Tru distances herself from her longtime boyfriend and begins to replace him with someone else before officially ending their relationship.",

East is another strong character who deserves more attention. Meanwhile, the relationship between Rio and Tru comes across as nearly codependent, even though they have just met. Tru often lacks independent thought, frequently adopting the beliefs of those around her.",

        "conclusion": "While the book has strong elements, such as well-executed twists and compelling reveals, it suffers from uneven pacing, underdeveloped characters, and an overly obvious paranormal twist. The emotional cheating and unclear resolution of the central mystery also detract from the overall experience. Despite these issues, the story has its moments, and fans of the author may still find it engaging.",

It revolves around Tru, a free water diver, and Rio, a new girl in town, as they try to solve the unsolved murders of two girls, Bailey and Celeste, from 20 years prior. The story is filled with flashbacks and visions of the murdered girls, creating a tense and engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n  The suffocating heat of the Florida summer and the dark depths of the dives add to the eerie and suspenseful atmosphere. The setting plays a significant role in enhancing the mood of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Tru and Rio share an instant connection, but their relationship development feels somewhat lacking. The major connection between them seems to stem from Celeste and Bailey's feelings, leaving me wondering if their bond would remain strong without this influence. East, a sweet character, meets a shocking fate that adds emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**  \n  The murder mystery is compelling, and I suspected nearly everyone by the time the killer was revealed. While I guessed the killer, the twist of it being the least likely person kept me engaged. The supernatural elements added an extra layer of tension and unease throughout the story.  \n\n- **Recommendations and Comparisons:**  \n  If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend *Dark and Shallow Lies* by the same author, which is set in the bayous of Louisiana and is one of my favorite books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a gripping YA thriller with a well-crafted mystery, supernatural elements, and a vivid setting. While the relationship development between Tru and Rio could have been stronger, the suspenseful plot and atmospheric writing make it a compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars.  \n\nThank you to NetGalley for the copy of the ebook."

            "In the novel, the main character, Trulee, repeatedly makes frustratingly poor decisions. She neglects crucial evidence, ventures out alone at night into dangerous situations, and confronts potential murderers without any caution. Her reckless actions not only put her own life at risk but also contribute to the tragic death of East, a character I found deeply sympathetic."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Decisions:**  \n  The main character, Trulee, consistently makes poor and frustrating decisions throughout the novel. She leaves important evidence unattended, wanders alone at night in dangerous situations, and confronts potential murderers without caution. Her reckless behavior not only endangers herself but also leads to the death of East, a character I deeply sympathized with.  \n\n- **Romantic Tropes:**  \n  I strongly dislike the trope where the protagonist abandons a genuine, loving relationship with a childhood sweetheart for a flashy, mysterious newcomer. Trulee’s breakup with East, followed by her retroactive justification that she was \"never actually in love with him,\" feels contrived and unsatisfying. Having been in her head, I know her feelings for East were real, and this trope undermines their relationship.  \n\n- **Moral and Emotional Choices:**  \n  Trulee’s actions after East’s death are particularly jarring. She makes out with Rio, a shady character she barely knows, just hours after attending East’s funeral. This behavior feels disrespectful and emotionally inconsistent, making it hard to root for her or Rio. Both characters come across as selfish and unlikable, to the point where I wished they had faced consequences in the story’s timeline.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel left me frustrated and disappointed due to the main character’s illogical decisions, the unsatisfying romantic tropes, and the lack of emotional depth in key moments. While the story had potential, Trulee’s actions and the narrative choices made it difficult to enjoy or connect with the characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The central mystery of their deaths captivates the protagonist, Tru, who becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth. While the mystery is skillfully crafted, some readers may deduce the killer's identity before the official reveal. The story eschews paranormal elements and major scares, opting instead to delve into the psychological and investigative dimensions of the case. It poses a thought-provoking question about thrillers: why would someone confront a suspected killer rather than observe them from a distance? This adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. The pacing is engaging, though those seeking a more intense thriller may find the absence of significant scares disappointing.",
            "Tru, the protagonist, is a flawed character. While she serves adequately as a lead, her treatment of others—particularly East, her mother, and Dill—falls short. Her relationship with Rio, a newcomer to town, takes center stage, overshadowing her interactions with those around her."

However, the story eventually picked up, delivering a satisfying mystery with intriguing twists. It’s a good read for those who enjoy a blend of mystery and the supernatural, though it could benefit from more consistent pacing and action.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There wasn’t a lot of sitting on the edge of my seat until near the end of the book when everything started to unravel.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Most of the characters weren’t very well developed. The two main characters are the only ones you really get much info about. My favorite character was East, Tru’s boyfriend.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Suspense:**  \n  It was kind of twisty.

This is one of those books where you can’t count anyone out.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I enjoyed the author’s writing style. There was enough description to feel immersed, but not too much that it took away from the story.  \n\n- **Author’s Future Work:**  \n  I can’t wait to read some of the author’s other books. They’re definitely on my TBR now.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book. While the pacing was slow at times, the twists and turns kept me engaged, especially toward the end.

It’s frustrating when authors don’t capture the authentic voice of teenagers. If the characters are supposed to be sixteen, make them sixteen, but then you wouldn’t be able to have forty-year-olds giving them weed and alcohol, which feels forced.\n\n- **Repetition and Overemphasis:**\n   - The story spent way too much time harping on the fact that the mayor had a girlfriend who was murdered. It became repetitive and annoying.\n\n- **Logical Consistency and Fairness:**\n   - People who did not kill someone should not be banned from jobs just because others think they’re guilty, especially when those accusing them weren’t even alive at the time. For example, having a sister who was killed shouldn’t disqualify someone from being a public servant.\n\n- **Resolution of Plot Points:**\n   - At the end, it’s revealed that the mayor was involved in a coverup, but the story never mentions what happened to him. Thrillers are supposed to wrap up loose ends, but they don’t even address whether he lost his position as mayor after lying to the police and aiding a serial killer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the novel had potential, its execution fell short in several areas.

The book was well-written with great storylines and plot twists.  \n\n- **Themes and Setting:**  \n  The story deals with family issues, the town’s past, relationships, and betrayal. The small-town setting was perfect, and I loved the Florida setting for this book.  \n\n- **Narrative Perspective and Main Character:**  \n  This book is told from Tru’s point of view. Tru is the female main character (FMC) and is haunted by the murders of Bailey and Celeste, though she doesn’t know why. I liked her character, but she’s considered unreliable for what is happening to her.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  There are many side characters in this book, and they play significant roles in the mystery.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n  There is a sapphic romance, which is friends-to-lovers and kind of fated mates.  \n\n- **Ending and Pacing:**  \n  The ending was well done, and I liked the twist in the last half of the book. However, I felt the ending was rushed, and I had to reread it to process what happened.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I recommend checking out this book, especially if you love mystery/thriller books.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping mystery with well-developed characters, a compelling small-town setting, and intriguing plot twists.

Some characters annoyed me, and I didn’t feel invested in them, which reduced the emotional stakes of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the lack of connection to the characters, I found the book highly enjoyable and would recommend it as a spooky summer mystery.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a gripping and atmospheric summer mystery with a supernatural twist. While the unexplained elements and lack of character connection were minor drawbacks, the intriguing plot and immersive setting made it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book features an engaging storyline that keeps you turning the pages, though it occasionally drags. It follows Tru and her enigmatic new friend Rio as they delve into the chilling 20-year-old murders of local girls Celeste and Bailey. While the mystery is compelling, I found it somewhat predictable, as I identified the killer(s) early on.",
            "The romance in the book felt shallow and rushed. Tru's relationship with Rio lacked realism, as she quickly accepted everything he said while dismissing the support of those who had always been there for her. It was hard to believe that Tru would leave East for someone she barely knew.",

It didn’t seem plausible that Tru would leave East for someone she hadn’t known for long.  \n\n- **Paranormal Elements:**  \n  The paranormal aspect was intriguing, but the idea of Tru and Rio being together because they believed they were connected in their past lives felt unconvincing and underwhelming.  \n\n- **Predictability:**  \n  The mystery was somewhat predictable, as I guessed the killer(s) early on.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  As always, I loved the settings in Ginny Myers Sain’s books.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story is set in a Florida town with a long-standing cold case involving the murder of two girls.\n   - The case attracts various individuals, including crime investigators, podcast journalists, and other curious visitors.\n   - The main character is a girl whose sister was also killed by the same murderer.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**\n   - I enjoyed the relationship between the main character and her boyfriend, East. Their dynamic added emotional depth to the story.\n   - It was heartbreaking to see what happened to East as the story progressed.\n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**\n   - A significant portion of the book revolves around discussions about the killer and the victims, which felt repetitive at times.\n   - The characters seemed to obsess over the case for about half of the book, which slowed the pacing.\n\n- **Mystery and Suspense:**\n   - The book effectively kept me guessing about the killer’s identity. There were multiple suspects, and I found myself pointing fingers at different characters throughout.\n   - The killer returns and resumes their crimes, adding tension and urgency to the story.\n   - The ending featured a massive twist, revealing the true identity of the killer in a surprising way. I was partially correct in my initial guess, which made the reveal satisfying.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - While the book had its strengths, such as the mystery and the twist, the repetitive focus on the case and the pacing issues made it just an \"all right\" read for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel is a decent mystery with a compelling cold case, engaging character relationships, and a surprising twist at the end. However, the pacing and repetitive focus on the case detracted from the overall experience. It’s a good read for those who enjoy guessing the killer’s identity, but it didn’t fully captivate me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3 stars."
