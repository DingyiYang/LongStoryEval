            "I appreciated how this novel unfolds as a family drama across generations, weaving a compelling mystery around Cecily's life that kept me engaged. The themes of loss, heartbreak, and love are prevalent throughout, with a central focus on adoption, child loss, and the trauma of stolen babies. The narrative prompted me to reflect on how DNA results can profoundly alter one's understanding of their history. Additionally, it shed light on the harsh treatment of unwed mothers in the past, adding depth to the story.",
            "The story presents a variety of perspectives across different time periods, which I appreciated. Cecily, along with her daughter and granddaughter, each offers unique viewpoints, with Cecily's perspective spanning both her past and 2015. Additionally, a mysterious viewpoint emerges midway through the novel. I guessed its identity early on, though the details remained unclear until I delved deeper into the narrative.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed Cecily's journey at the circus and her transformation into an expert horse rider. The narrative revealed the dark side of circus life and the prevalent abuse, which added depth to the story. I appreciated how her mentor, Isabelle, initially protected her, but I was taken aback when she later turned against Cecily. I also loved that the circus wintered in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, just a short drive from my home. The familiar locations throughout Wisconsin added an extra layer of enjoyment to my reading experience.",
            "**Favorite Quote:** “Cecily felt the collapse like it was her own hope – a thing she’d been carrying all these years without even realizing the weight of it.” \n\nThis quote perfectly encapsulates the emotional depth of the story, illustrating Cecily's unrecognized burden and the profound impact of unexpected loss. The narrative beautifully explores themes of hope and resilience, drawing readers into Cecily's internal struggle. Overall, the story skillfully balances character development with a poignant exploration of the human experience, leaving a lasting impression.",
            "I couldn't put this book down and was tempted to take time off work just to finish it. It's a captivating blend of \"Orphan Train\" and \"Water for Elephants,\" both of which I thoroughly enjoyed, and I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Hidden Life of Cecily Larson* was a riveting family drama and historical fiction novel that focused on adoption. I agree with the assessment that it is perfect for fans of *The Orphan Train* and *Water for Elephants*.",

            "The story opens with a poignant moment as Cecily is left at an orphanage by her mother, who promises to return. Eventually, she is sold to a traveling circus, where she discovers a new life and an adopted big sister who trains her as a bareback rider. What initially seems glamorous—filled with vibrant animals, new experiences, and abundant food—gradually loses its luster. The narrative alternates between Cecily's childhood in the circus and her later life in her 90s, where she confronts challenges like a broken hip. The author also weaves in the struggles of three additional generations of Cecily's family. A significant twist occurs about a third of the way through; while it initially seemed unnecessary, the author deftly connects all the threads. The skillful integration of multiple timelines and storylines is truly impressive, and the pacing keeps the reader engaged, particularly with the dramatic twist that adds an intriguing layer. The polished language enhances the smooth flow of the complex narrative.",

Her relationships with other characters, such as Isabella, the circus owner, and her love interest Lucky, are complex and emotionally rich.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The novel starts with a strong focus on Cecily's early life in the orphanage and her subsequent journey with the circus, which is engaging and well-developed.\n   - However, the story shifts abruptly towards the end, introducing a modern-day timeline (2015) and a DNA test subplot, which feels rushed and crammed into the last 30% of the book.\n   - The circus storyline dominates most of the novel, leaving the modern-day revelations feeling like an \"info dump\" rather than a smoothly integrated part of the narrative.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Cecily is portrayed as a deeply empathetic and hopeful character, whose innocence and resilience make her journey compelling.\n   - The relationships between Cecily and other characters, such as Isabella, the circus owner, and her love interest Lucky, are complex and emotionally charged.\n   - The modern-day characters, including Cecily’s daughter Liz, granddaughter Molly, and great-grandson Cade, are introduced late but add depth to the exploration of family dynamics and generational connections.\n\n- **Themes:**\n   - The novel explores powerful themes such as love, family, forgiveness, adoption, and the yearning to connect with one’s biological roots.\n   - It also delves into the effects of trauma, resilience, and the enduring hope for reconciliation and happiness.\n   - The story balances heartbreak with inspiration, ultimately delivering a message of love in its many forms.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The novel is emotionally resonant, with moments of deep heartbreak, particularly in Cecily’s early struggles and her separation from her mother and later her baby.\n   - Despite the heavy themes, the story also offers hope and ends on a heartwarming note with a \"happily ever after\" (HEA) conclusion.\n   - The exploration of love—romantic, familial, and self-love—is particularly moving and leaves a lasting impression.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The novel is written with a \"huge heart,\" as the prose is heartfelt and evocative, capturing the emotional depth of the characters and their journeys.\n   - The author’s ability to weave multiple timelines and themes together, though unevenly paced, showcases a strong narrative ambition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, *The Hidden Life of Cecily Larson* is a richly layered novel that explores profound themes of love, family, and forgiveness. While the pacing and structure could have been more balanced, particularly in integrating the modern-day storyline earlier, the emotional depth and heartfelt storytelling make it a memorable read. The novel’s exploration of resilience and the many forms of love left me feeling inspired and grateful for the experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Emotional Impact: 9/10  \n- Character Development: 8/10  \n- Plot Structure and Pacing: 6/10  \n- Themes and Messages: 9/10  \n- Writing Style: 8/10  \n\n**Overall Rating:** 8/10"

She embodied strength, hope, and a strong will, making her the kind of figure that all families would wish to stem from.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The story revolved around the theme of hope, encapsulated in the line, \"Hope begins with St. Jude.\" This idea was woven throughout the narrative, giving it a powerful and uplifting message.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a beautifully written, emotionally resonant story that combines vivid imagery, a complex yet cohesive narrative structure, and a deeply inspiring main character.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Story Structure:**  \n   - The novel is an emotional, multigenerational story that unfolds like a gentle mystery.  \n   - It highlights cultural differences about single motherhood and adoption since the 1920s and emphasizes the importance of parent-child relationships, regardless of genetic links.  \n   - The circus storyline adds color and drama to Cecily’s early life, but the introduction of a second family story adds many characters, making it hard to keep up at times.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n   - The story explores the evolving cultural attitudes toward single motherhood and adoption over time.  \n   - It underscores the significance of family bonds, whether biological or not.  \n   - The role of DNA tests in clarifying family relationships is a central theme, though the reviewer notes that in real life, DNA tests can sometimes complicate relationships.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Cecily’s character is well-developed, with her early life in the circus and her later years as a 94-year-old woman providing a rich backdrop for her story.  \n   - The introduction of additional family members (Liz, Molly, and Caden) adds depth but also complexity, sometimes making it challenging to follow all the characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The writing is described as sweet and complicated, with a gentle, mysterious tone that draws the reader in.  \n   - The reviewer appreciates the emotional depth and the way the story unfolds.  \n\n- **Literary Pet Peeves:**  \n   - The reviewer notes the overuse of green eyes in fictional female characters (Grace has green eyes).  \n   - There are no horticultural faux pas, though Cecily’s reaction to the word “tulips” is mentioned as an inexplicable detail.  \n\n- **Reader Experience and Satisfaction:**  \n   - The reviewer enjoyed the book but felt it could have benefited from a visual Ancestry family tree illustration or a link to clarify the family connections.  \n   - The story is described as sweet and complicated, earning a 3.5-star rating.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a heartfelt, multigenerational novel that explores themes of family, identity, and the evolving cultural attitudes toward single motherhood and adoption. While the circus storyline adds drama and color, the introduction of a second family story complicates the narrative. The book’s emotional depth and gentle mystery make it a compelling read, though the reviewer wished for a clearer visual representation of the family tree.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars.  \n\n**Acknowledgments:**  \nThank you to Mariner Books and NetGalley for providing a free advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review."

            "I appreciate a well-crafted book where character connections reveal themselves gradually, and this one excels in that regard. The pacing kept me engaged, drawing me into Cecily's life at various stages and leaving me eager for answers. While I found Liz to be my least favorite character due to her lack of likability, the moment when Kate reconnects with her son is beautifully poignant, even if somewhat predictable. The parallels between Cecily and her granddaughters—Molly, who faces miscarriages, and Kate, who experiences young pregnancy and adoption—are touching. However, I was frustrated by the lack of open communication between Cecily and Clarissa's families, particularly regarding the relationships between mothers and daughters.",

Witnessing Isabelle’s betrayal as she turned Cecily in to the police.\n3. Uncovering the heartbreaking truth that the doctor rendered Cecily unable to have more children.\n4. Realizing that the doctor took Cecily’s baby and deceived her into believing it had died."

This book was really nicely paced to keep you wanting more answers while sucking you into Cecily’s life at every age. It had me captivated and wanting to understand the full picture from start to end.\n\n- **Themes and Topics:**\n   - The book covers a LOT of weighty topics, including rape, racism, alcoholism, eugenics, and cancer. These themes added depth and complexity to the story.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - **Standout moments that made me 🥹:**\n     1. Knowing Lucky’s grandmother was the origin of Cecily’s famous 15-layer cakes.\n     2. Lucky’s ice cream shops - “building an empire” in an attempt to find Cecily.\n     3. Reyna showing Cecily the notebook with the poem about her.\n     4. The last ~30 pages or so with the family reunion.\n   - **Standout moments that made me 😡:**\n     1. Knowing that Isabelle took abuse from Mr. Tebow to protect Cecily.\n     2. Isabelle betraying Cecily and turning her in to the police.\n     3. Finding out the doctor made Cecily unable to have any more children.\n     4. Finding out the doctor TOOK Cecily’s baby and lied to her, saying the baby died.\n\n- **Character Likability:**\n   - Liz was probably my least favorite character… she didn’t do much to be likable.\n\n- **Recurring Themes:**\n   - It is so sad how being bought is a common theme throughout Cecily’s life. Mr. Tebow bought her at the orphanage, then her daughter ends up being bought (thanks to the doctor’s manipulation).\n\n- **Family Dynamics:**\n   - Kate connecting with her son at the end is a really beautiful moment (to be expected but that’s okay).\n   - The parallels between Cecily and two of her granddaughters - Molly (miscarriages / losing kids) and Kate (young pregnancy and having your child be adopted) - were endearing.\n   - It bothered me generally how little both Cecily and Clarissa’s families talked about things openly between the mothers and daughters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book was a captivating read with well-developed characters and a complex web of interconnected stories. The emotional highs and lows, along with the exploration of heavy themes, made for a deeply engaging experience.

            "This dual-timeline historical fiction novel skillfully intertwines the story of the Larson family across generations, alternating between the 1930s and 2015. The 1930s narrative centers on Cecily, who, abandoned at an orphanage, is recruited into the Sax and Tebow circus at age seven due to her acrobatic talent. She is mentored by Isabelle, a young teen who assists her with her bareback riding act. In the 2015 timeline, a 94-year-old Cecily is recovering from a fall, while her daughter Liz, granddaughter Molly, and great-grandson Caden delve into family secrets during a genealogy project. The novel spans a wide range of time and topics, which can make it challenging to keep track of names and details. However, the engaging pacing and well-integrated dual timelines effectively maintain interest throughout.",
            "The novel showcases multiple generations of strong, well-developed female characters, including Cecily, Liz, Molly, and Isabelle. Cecily's transformation from abandonment to circus performer and eventual matriarch is especially compelling. The nuanced relationships among the characters form the emotional core of the story.",
            "This novel intricately weaves themes of family, abandonment, resilience, and the complexities of intergenerational relationships. It thoughtfully addresses sensitive issues like interracial dating and eugenics, enriching the narrative with depth and historical context. At its core, the story highlights the origins of the family and the unwavering efforts of strong women across generations to maintain their bonds."

        "conclusion": "This dual-timeline historical fiction masterfully intertwines the past and present to tell the story of the Larson family. With its strong female characters, emotional depth, and exploration of complex themes, it is a compelling and enjoyable read.",

            "The novel centers on Cecily McAvoy, a girl abandoned at an orphanage who is later adopted by a circus owner and renamed Jacqueline Dumonde. As a bareback rider, she discovers a sense of belonging within the circus, only to have it shattered by her love for a roustabout. Ninety years later, Cecily Larson (formerly McAvoy) resides in Minnesota with her family, while another woman, Clarissa, lives in Florida with her daughters. Both women grapple with profound losses. The narrative shifts between various time periods and locations, including the Midwest, the Depression-era South, and different parts of twentieth-century America. Despite the complexity of multiple characters and subplots, the author skillfully maintains engagement, even when connections between characters occasionally cause confusion. While some subplots are less compelling than Cecily's central story, they do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the novel.",

It took me a while to keep everyone straight.  \n\n- **Character Development and Resolution:**  \n  - I wish we had found out what happened to Dolores and Flip (Cecily’s friends from the orphanage).  \n\n- **Continuity and Accuracy:**  \n  - The ages of the characters seemed inconsistent. If I recall correctly, Cecily was 15 and Lucky was 19 when they met and fell in love. However, at the end, it was mentioned that if Lucky had lived, he would have been 97, which would make him only 2 years older than Cecily, not 4.  \n  - Additionally, if Cecily gave birth to Clarissa at 15, Clarissa would have been 80, but the author ages her at 78.  \n  - I’m big on continuity, so even if this is a minor issue, it stands out to me as something that should have been correct.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the book highly engaging and emotionally impactful, with characters I truly cared about. However, the confusing beginning, unresolved subplots, and minor continuity errors detracted from my enjoyment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book captivated me with its compelling storyline centered on 94-year-old Cecily, who harbors a lifelong secret: her mother abandoned her at an orphanage, promising to return but never did. The narrative traces Cecily’s journey as a circus performer, her romance with a roustabout, her unexpected pregnancy, and the surprising DNA results she receives without her consent. While some plot points elicited eye-rolls, the story remained entertaining overall. However, the book stumbled around the halfway mark with the introduction of a new group of characters. Initially feeling disconnected from the main narrative, these characters, though eventually tied in, lacked the depth and detail of the core cast, making their presence feel more secondary than integral.",

The title and cover lead you to believe it’s the story of an orphan who joins a circus, but this is really just a small part of what is actually a sprawling multi-generational story about love and secrets.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  I did find there to be some pacing issues towards the middle, but ultimately the ending is heartwarming and very satisfying.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  There are a lot of loose threads in this book that I had doubted could all be wrapped up neatly, but fortunately, I was wrong, and everything comes together in a way that makes perfect sense.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  I wouldn’t advise coming into this book expecting adventure because it’s much more about the characters and their inner struggles and relationships than anything else.  \n\n- **Appeal to Readers:**  \n  If you love unexpected family stories with lots of heart, this will be a great read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book defies initial expectations, offering a rich, multi-generational tale centered on love, secrets, and family dynamics. While the pacing stumbles slightly in the middle, the satisfying resolution and heartfelt storytelling make it a rewarding read for those who enjoy character-driven narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel weaves through multiple timelines, starting in 1924 when Cecily is abandoned at an orphanage and later sold to a traveling circus. Her life takes dramatic turns as she becomes entwined with the circus and forms relationships that put her at risk. Fast forward to 2015, at 94, Cecily's quiet existence is shattered when a DNA test uncovers long-buried secrets, unraveling the family she has built over the decades. While the inclusion of four generations and their individual dramas occasionally felt overwhelming, it ultimately served the story's purpose. The dual timelines and diverse characters created a rich narrative, though the complexity sometimes hindered a deeper connection to Cecily's central journey.",
            "Cecily’s journey from an abandoned orphan to a resilient woman who creates her own family is compelling. Her transformation into Jacqueline DuMonde within the circus, along with her relationship with Lucky, adds depth to her character. The portrayal of her later years as a 94-year-old grappling with her past is particularly poignant. However, the multiple generations and their subplots occasionally detract from the focus on Cecily’s story.",
            "The novel delves into themes of hope, resilience, and the lasting effects of secrets. Cecily's journey, defined by loss and reinvention, gains emotional depth through the unveiling of her hidden past. While the tragic love story and its repercussions resonate powerfully, the intricate family dynamics sometimes detract from the overall emotional impact."

However, the plotlines were winding and often difficult to follow, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  There were too many characters introduced, making it challenging to keep track of them and their roles in the story. This added to the confusion and made the narrative harder to engage with.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The revelation about Cecily's DNA and the resulting heartache added emotional depth to the story, which was a strong point.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the central story of Cecily was intriguing and emotionally resonant, the novel's complexity and the overwhelming number of characters made it difficult to fully enjoy. The winding plotlines often led to confusion, which overshadowed the otherwise engaging narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars"

            "This family drama unfolds across two time periods: Cecily's youth and her later years in the twilight of her life. Rather than alternating chapters, the narrative shifts between these timelines, with the later years proving more engaging and meaningful. The premise is intriguing—an orphan adopted by a circus, exploring her growth, relationships, betrayals, and the secrets that emerge in her later years. However, the execution leaves something to be desired; several questions remain unanswered, and some plot points could have been resolved more effectively. Additionally, the book feels overly long, dragging in places where a more concise approach would have preserved its essence.",

Lucky leaves without knowing about the pregnancy.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n   - The book's timeline shifts between the 1930s and 2015, which I found confusing.  \n   - Just as I got accustomed to one timeline, another character and timeline were introduced, disrupting the flow.  \n   - The frequent shifts made it harder to connect with the characters and the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Cecily's emotional journey—her abandonment, search for love, and struggles—was compelling.  \n   - However, the characters felt disjointed due to the fragmented narrative structure.  \n   - I would have preferred a more cohesive weaving of characters into the storyline rather than the back-and-forth timeline shifts.  \n\n- **Spoiler Avoidance:**  \n   - I intentionally omitted many details to avoid spoiling the ending for potential readers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing premise and a compelling protagonist in Cecily Larson, the confusing timeline shifts and disjointed narrative structure detracted from my overall enjoyment. A more cohesive approach to storytelling would have enhanced my connection to the characters and the plot.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The story culminates in the present day, where the lives of the characters intersect messily but ultimately resolve with a sense of closure and happiness.\n\n- **Writing Style:**\n   - The writing style is overly detailed in places, which can detract from the story. Some plot points are unclear, such as Liz having a son, which seems to be introduced abruptly without prior mention.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The story explores the concept of family and what it means to be a family. It delves into the hardships and tragedies faced by Cecily and how the characters come to terms with their past and find happiness in their own ways.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book is a compelling family saga that spans nearly a century, filled with drama and emotional depth. While it lacks major twists and can be overly detailed, it ultimately delivers a satisfying conclusion about the meaning of family and personal happiness.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- 3.5 stars."

            "The story concluded rather abruptly after its emotional climax, leaving me wanting a deeper exploration of the family dynamics and unresolved issues. The first two-thirds of the book felt slow, gradually revealing Cecily’s hidden life. However, the final seventy pages were the most engaging, as the characters confronted their baggage, adding emotional depth and momentum to the narrative. I couldn't help but wonder if the book would have been stronger had it begun at the moment of exposure, focusing on the messy aftermath and family dynamics that truly deserved exploration.",
            "The book navigates multiple timelines and perspectives, which, while not confusing, suffer from a lack of distinct voices for each character and age. Cecily's thoughts and vocabulary remain largely unchanged from age seven to her senior years, portraying her as a naive, sheltered adult throughout her life.",
            "The story emphasizes domestic drama over circus life, delving into themes like aging, illness, the effects of miscarriages on marriage, recovery from alcoholism, racial identity, interracial romance, and the harsh realities faced by wayward girls. While these themes are engaging, the book tries to address too many issues at once, resulting in a lack of depth for each topic."

However, the book did not deliver on this expectation.  \n   - While Cecily is sold to a circus at seven and there are glimpses of her life there (e.g., stables, train car, minimal horse act training), the circus setting and its atmosphere are not central to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Voice:**  \n   - The book juggles multiple timelines and POVs, which were not confusing but lacked distinct voices for each character and age.  \n   - Cecily’s thoughts and vocabulary remained largely consistent from age seven to her senior years, making her seem like a naive, sheltered adult throughout her life.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n   - The story focuses more on domestic drama than circus life, exploring themes such as aging, illness, the impact of miscarriages on a marriage, recovery from alcoholism, racial identity, interracial romance, and the harsh realities of homes for \"wayward girls.\"  \n   - While these themes held my interest, the book attempted to tackle too many issues, leaving little room to delve deeply into any of them.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The first two-thirds of the book felt slow, with gradual revelations about Cecily’s hidden life.  \n   - The final seventy pages were the most engaging, as the characters openly discussed their baggage, bringing more emotional depth and forward momentum to the story.  \n   - I wondered if the book would have been stronger if it had started at the moment when everything is exposed, focusing on the messy aftermath and family dynamics, which felt more deserving of exploration.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - The story wrapped up somewhat hastily after the emotional climax, leaving me wishing for a more thorough exploration of the family dynamics and unresolved issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book did not meet my initial expectations of a circus-centered coming-of-age story, it offered a range of compelling domestic themes.

The frequent shifts in timeline and perspective create confusion, making the plot hard to follow. Part Two introduces another four-generation family on the opposite side of the country, each with their own intricate backstories.

The narrative alternates between Cecily's circus life and events in 2015, but the transition to her time at the sanatorium and her meeting with Sam feels disjointed. I struggled to understand how and when Cecily ended up at the sanatorium and married Sam. The story had the potential to delve deeper into character development or to focus more on the theme of forced sterilization, which persisted in some parts of the U.S. into the 1970s. Unfortunately, the novel doesn't fully commit to either direction, leaving me wanting more.",
            "The storyline was decent, but I craved greater depth in the characters, especially Liz. Her intriguing personality and motivations, particularly her jaded nature before uncovering the family secret, warranted further exploration. I found the distortion of Liz's perception of Cecily's scar—transforming it into something horrific—fascinating, yet it left me wanting more insight into her character. Cecily's perspective on her scar, viewing it as a cherished symbol of Liz's origins, was touching, but Liz's contrasting viewpoint needed more elaboration."

The narrative centers on a family tree project initiated by her great-grandson, Caden, which threatens to unveil long-buried secrets. While the premise is compelling, the plot occasionally drags, leading to sections that feel unnecessarily extended. Although the story resolves its conflicts, it glosses over ethical dilemmas with a dismissive \"it all worked out in the end\" attitude.

While the book allows readers to project their own emotions onto them, the characters themselves lack the depth to evoke genuine emotional responses. Cecily’s Black love interest feels like an afterthought in an otherwise predominantly white narrative. Additionally, the portrayal of racism and white supremacy is problematic; Cecily’s naivety regarding these issues is hard to believe. The narrative seems to revise history by implying that anti-Blackness is limited to overt villains, rather than acknowledging it as a systemic issue that involves all white people."

            "One aspect I found unconvincing was the family's reaction to the DNA test results. It felt unrealistic, particularly given my firsthand experience with DNA testing in the 2010s. During my university research with 23andMe, counseling was a crucial part of the process, making the family's response in the book seem less credible."

I found it fascinating how the author tied these elements together and provided a glimpse into these historical moments.  \n\n- **Character Reactions and Realism:**  \n  One aspect I didn’t enjoy was the family’s reaction to the DNA test results. It felt unrealistic or poorly handled, especially since I have firsthand experience with the DNA testing phase of the 2010s. During my university research with 23andMe, counseling was a critical part of the process, which made the family’s reaction in the book seem less believable.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  While the book was good and covered interesting topics, it was just okay overall. I wouldn’t be the first to recommend it to someone else.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a compelling plot and effectively integrated historical events, but the unrealistic portrayal of family reactions to DNA testing detracted from the experience.

Fast forward to 2015, Cecily is now 94 years old, and the narrative shifts to her daughter, granddaughter, and great-grandson. A DNA test purchased by her great-grandson for a school project uncovers long-buried family secrets. While Cecily's journey is compelling, the side stories involving Molly and Liz lack engagement. The introduction of Clarissa, Lana, and Kate initially feels irrelevant, and their eventual connection to the main plot fails to make a significant impact.

It had many great storylines that I would have loved to see explored even more.  \n\n- **Modern Timeline Complexity:**  \n  The current-day timeline felt overly complicated, with too many health-related storylines, Molly’s marriage and fertility issues, and Kate’s addiction.  \n\n- **Character Introduction and Development:**  \n  The characters Lana, Kate, and Clarissa seemed to be introduced abruptly and out of nowhere, which made their integration into the story feel less organic.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was enjoyable and had a strong historical foundation, the modern timeline was overly complex and detracted from the story’s potential. The abrupt introduction of certain characters also hindered the overall flow.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Additionally, the narrative included time jumps and layered backstories for each character. While these elements aimed to add depth, they often distracted from the primary narrative rather than enhancing it.  \n\n- **Complexity of Storytelling:**  \n  The storytelling felt unnecessarily complex, to the point where it became distracting. The intricate structure and multiple layers made it harder to stay engaged with the main plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had its merits, particularly in the individual stories that I found enjoyable. However, the overly complex narrative structure, with its multiple POVs, time jumps, and extensive backstories, detracted from the overall experience. While it had potential, the execution made it harder to fully appreciate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded to 3 stars if necessary)."

The pacing felt disrupted, and I found it harder to stay immersed.\n\n- **Character Clarity and Connection:**  \n  I struggled to keep track of which character was who and how they were connected. The introduction of multiple families and characters made it challenging to maintain a clear understanding of their relationships.\n\n- **Plot Complexity:**  \n  While the central story was very good, there was too much collateral. The additional subplots and characters felt overwhelming and detracted from the main narrative for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCecily's story had a strong and engaging start, but the introduction of multiple families and characters made it difficult to stay invested. The central plot was compelling, but the complexity and additional elements overshadowed it, making the overall experience less enjoyable for me.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The numerous adoptions and instances of abandonment within a single family felt unrealistic and overdone.",

The cancer subplot seems redundant; Liz's grief over her deceased husband is already poignant enough without the additional complication of a secondary health issue.\n3. The reunion between Molly and Evan feels contrived, and their painful separation is excessive. Caden's disrespectful behavior toward Molly suggests she needs a stronger male presence to parent effectively, which is frustrating.\n4. Grace's character appears briefly with a single purpose before vanishing, indicating that some characters could be removed for a more cohesive story. Cecily's reaction to Clarissa's situation and her dismissive attitude toward Liz's pain are particularly disappointing. Her lack of empathy diminishes the emotional impact of Liz's compelling history and grief, ultimately making Cecily a character I found hard to like.",

The history and atmosphere of the circus were well-crafted, making these sections the reader's favorite.  \n   - The prose was beautiful, the characters were interesting, and the relationships between them were compelling and worth exploring further.  \n\n- **Present Timeline (Cecily's Story):**  \n   - The present timeline, focusing on 94-year-old Cecily and her familial drama, failed to engage the reader. It felt like a soap opera and lacked the depth and beauty of the historical sections.  \n   - The contrast between the two timelines made it feel like reading two entirely different books.  \n\n- **Overall Structure and Focus:**  \n   - The book would have been more successful if it had remained focused on the past timeline, particularly Cecily’s coming-of-age story within the circus setting.  \n   - The shift to the present timeline disrupted the flow and ultimately caused the book to lose the reader's attention.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the historical timeline was beautifully written and engaging, the present timeline fell flat, making the book feel disjointed. The story would have been stronger if it had stayed rooted in the past, focusing on the circus and Cecily’s formative years.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

They felt distant and lacked warmth, making it hard to care about their journeys or experiences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was a letdown for me. It failed to live up to my expectations, lacked engaging characters, and didn’t hold my interest. While I pushed myself to finish it, I didn’t find it enjoyable or emotionally resonant.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I initially approached the book with enthusiasm, the writing style and pacing made it difficult to stay invested.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Later, an older woman, her daughter, and granddaughter are introduced, seemingly unrelated until the final quarter of the book when all connections are revealed. The frequent jumps between characters and timelines made it challenging to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The Audible version used a single narrator who maintained the same voice throughout, except for child-Cecily, who was voiced in a high-pitched, Minnie Mouse-like tone. This lack of distinct voices for different characters added to the difficulty of following the story.  \n\n- **Plot Resolution:**  \n  By the end of the book, all the pieces came together, revealing a cohesive and predictable picture. While the resolution was satisfying, it didn’t compensate for the struggle of getting through the disjointed narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The book failed to hold my interest due to its confusing structure and lack of distinct narration.

I couldn't develop any sympathy for them, which made it difficult to connect with the story.  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot felt incomplete, with too many characters introduced and then abruptly dropped. This lack of resolution left me unsatisfied.  \n- **Plot Elements (Secret and Reactions):**  \n  The central secret in the story struck me as quite stupid, and the daughter's reaction to it seemed ridiculous, further detracting from my enjoyment.  \n- **Overall Theme and Purpose:**  \n  I felt that the book came across more like an advertisement for Ancestry rather than a compelling narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did not enjoy this book. The lack of believable characters, unresolved plotlines, and unconvincing elements made it difficult for me to engage with the story. The book's focus on ancestry felt more like a promotional effort than a meaningful exploration of its themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

The shocking revelations about Cecily’s sterilization and the circumstances surrounding Liz’s adoption were skillfully woven into the plot. However, the ending was frustrating; Cecily’s actions and the family’s dismissive response to Liz’s suffering were inadequately addressed. While Liz’s story remained unresolved, raising more questions than answers, Cecily’s narrative concluded on a positive note.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The ending left me speechless with rage and heartache. I felt intense anger towards Cecily, Molly, and Eric for their actions and comments.\n   - Liz’s story, especially her cancer diagnosis and the revelation about her adoption, was deeply upsetting and felt unjustly glossed over.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Cecily was a well-developed character, and I initially liked her until the end, where her actions became unforgivable.\n   - Liz deserved better from everyone in her life, and her character’s pain and betrayal were not adequately addressed.\n   - The secondary characters, like Kate, Lana, and Clarissa, were complex and added depth to the story, though Lana was particularly insufferable.\n\n- **Historical and Social Context:**\n   - The historical details about life in the circus and the adoption industry were well-researched and appreciated.\n   - The book effectively highlighted the trauma of unwed girls forced to give up their babies and the systemic racism and profit motives in adoption.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The buildup to the DNA test results and the intertwining of Liz’s cancer diagnosis added tension and depth to the story.\n   - The revelation about Cecily’s sterilization and the circumstances of Liz’s adoption were shocking and well-integrated into the plot.\n\n- **Moral and Ethical Dilemmas:**\n   - The ethical implications of Cecily and Sam stealing Liz from her biological family and erasing her identity were deeply troubling.\n   - The book’s handling of Liz’s anger and betrayal was inadequate, and the celebration of Cecily’s reunion with her biological family felt unjust.\n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**\n   - The ending was infuriating, with Cecily’s actions and the family’s response to Liz’s pain being completely glossed over.\n   - Liz’s story was left unresolved, with more questions than answers, while Cecily’s story was given a happy resolution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book started strong with rich historical details and complex characters, but the ending was deeply unsatisfying and unjust. Liz’s pain and betrayal were inadequately addressed, and the celebration of Cecily’s reunion felt like a betrayal of Liz’s story. The book had the potential to be a powerful exploration of trauma and identity but fell short in its resolution.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Initial rating: 5 stars for most of the book.\n- Final rating: 0 stars for the ending and handling of Liz’s story."

The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, especially after the buildup to a major reveal.  \n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters experienced significant trauma, but their emotional arcs were poorly handled. Their struggles were brushed aside, reducing their depth and making their resolution feel superficial.  \n- **Themes and Resolution:**  \n  The theme of \"love conquers all\" was overused and undermined the gravity of the characters' experiences. The ending tied everything up too neatly, ignoring the complexity of the trauma they endured.  \n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the promising start, the novel's flaws in pacing, character development, and thematic resolution make it difficult to recommend.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential with its strong beginning, it ultimately fell short due to its disjointed plot, underdeveloped characters, and overly simplistic resolution.

However, it failed to meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I found the book to be mind-numbingly boring from the start. Despite my usual rule of giving a book at least 100 pages to capture my interest, I couldn’t make it past page 63. The pacing and lack of engagement made it difficult to continue.  \n\n- **Satisfaction with Decision to Stop Reading:**  \n  After reading several reviews (some with spoilers) to understand how the book ended, I felt confident in my decision to stop reading. I’m glad I didn’t push through, as the story didn’t seem to improve or offer anything compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of the book initially intrigued me, the execution fell flat.
