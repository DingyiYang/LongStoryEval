However, I recommend reading the others if you get a chance, as they are all good.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development**  \n   - I enjoy the way Alex Delaware and Detective Milo Sturgis work together. Their different skills complement each other, helping them solve cases effectively.  \n   - I really like Alex’s partner, Robin. She is an independent thinker and has a unique hobby of restoring old or broken guitars.  \n   - The dialogue between the characters is enjoyable as they work through the clues and delve deeper into the investigation.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing**  \n   - The story is a strong police procedural, with an investigation that is thoughtfully followed through rather than fast-paced.  \n   - The plot is well-written and kept my interest throughout. It involves a double homicide, stolen identities, and long-buried secrets, making it one of the most shocking cases in Alex and Milo’s careers.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere**  \n   - Los Angeles is portrayed as a city of reinvention, where people come to start anew, but also where secrets and danger lurk beneath the surface.  \n   - The upscale, secluded home where the double homicide occurs adds an intriguing layer to the story, making it stand out from typical cases.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Engagement**  \n   - Jonathan Kellerman’s writing is engaging and maintains the reader’s interest throughout the book.  \n   - The inclusion of familiar characters from previous books adds a sense of continuity and depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling addition to the Alex Delaware series, offering a well-crafted police procedural with intriguing character dynamics and a thoughtfully paced investigation.

With an abundance of suspects and elusive answers, the narrative keeps readers engaged. While I don't usually feel deeply for victims, these characters succeeded in evoking sympathy. This tale stands out to me because it deviates from conventional resolutions, leaving at least one scenario intriguingly unresolved.",
            "I was eager to see if Alex (Dr. Delaware) would recover from his serious injuries sustained months earlier. While he has improved, his best friend, Lt. Sturgis, continues to grapple with guilt for putting Alex in danger. I appreciated the emphasis on the risks faced by civilians at crime scenes, which added depth to the story.",

            "In *The Ghost Orchid*, I found myself confused by certain details that seemed inconsistent with the previous book. I don't recall Alex being seriously injured by Milo or Rick leaving him, which left me puzzled about what I might have missed. The reference to Milo’s past relationship in the past tense also felt off. These uncertainties overshadowed my reading experience. Unfortunately, the book largely felt like a snooze fest. The now unengaging duo fumbled through endless discussions and fruitless leads while attempting to identify the intended victim and perpetrator. The noticeable absence of modern investigative techniques, like DNA and fingerprint analysis, made the plot feel tedious and uninspired.",
            "The only truly authentic characters were the Italians; the others felt one-dimensional. Milo's dialogue, particularly his exchange with a woman regarding a victim (\"He died\"), came off as awkward and poorly crafted. Alex's subplot about child evaluation seemed unnecessary and was poorly resolved, lacking any real connection to his character. Even Robin, Milo, and Blanche felt less prominent, and the absence of any mention of the Koi was surprisingly disappointing.",

Their dynamic is one of the highlights of the novel.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Pacing:**  \n  - The book started out well, with lots of different suspects—some normal, some weird (like Douglass).

This resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Character Depth and Development:**  \n  - Meagin, one of the victims, started as an intriguing character but became one-dimensional as the story focused excessively on her past. By the end, I found myself caring less and less about her.  \n  - The secondary story involving a young adoptee caught in a divorce felt underdeveloped and resolved too quickly, almost as an afterthought, without much involvement from Alex.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  - While this was an “alright” book, it didn’t live up to the standard of Kellerman’s past novels. The storytelling and character development felt weaker compared to his earlier works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel had its moments, particularly in the engaging dynamic between Alex and Milo and the initial setup of the mystery.

            "The story opens with a double homicide involving the wife of a real estate tycoon and her playboy boyfriend. Initially, the husband emerges as the primary suspect, but detectives Alex and Milo's skepticism leads them to delve into the victims' backgrounds. The investigation hinges on Alex’s psychological profiling rather than modern forensics, with his online research and evolving insights proving pivotal in unraveling the mystery. The plot gains momentum in the final third, where the chilling motive and dark past unfold. However, a subplot featuring Alex's assessment of a teenage boy caught in a custody battle feels out of place and detracts from the main narrative, providing a less than satisfying conclusion. Additionally, while the pacing lags during some middle sections, the story ultimately picks up pace in the final act.",

The victims are Giovanni Aggiunta, a young heir to an Italian shoe empire, and Meagin Marsh, the striking neighbor and wife of millionaire real estate developer Douglass March. I found the unique spelling of Meagin intriguing and appreciated that her background was explored in greater detail. While the narrative primarily unfolds in Los Angeles, I was pleasantly surprised to see Orange County referenced during Milo and Alex's visit to Chandler University, a fictional institution reminiscent of Chapman University in Orange, CA.",

Having read and enjoyed fifteen stories in this series, I am hooked and eagerly anticipate each new installment.\n   - In *Unnatural History* (Book #38), Alex was nearly killed, and Milo feels guilty. It’s been over four months, and Robin calls Milo to let him know Alex needs to get back to work. This sets the stage for the story.\n   - I enjoy these characters, and Jonathan Kellerman continues to deliver fresh ideas without disappointing. This story feels like one of his best and deserves 5 stars.\n\n- **Plot and Setting:**\n   - The story begins with Milo and Alex investigating a 911 call at a BelAir rental with a kidney-shaped pool. (Though the illustrator depicted the pool as a rectangle, which made me wonder about artistic choices or if someone missed the detail.)\n   - The victims are Giovanni Aggiunta, a young heir to an Italian shoe empire, and Meagin Marsh, the attractive neighbor and wife of millionaire real estate developer Douglass March. The spelling of \"Meagin\" caught my attention, and I was pleased to see her background explored further.\n   - The story is primarily set in LA, but I was delighted to see Orange County mentioned when Milo and Alex visit Chandler University, a fictional institution reminiscent of Chapman University in Orange, CA.\n\n- **Supporting Characters and Future Potential:**\n   - The story includes more about young Derek Ruffalo, and I wonder if we’ll see more of him in Book #40.\n   - I’m already looking forward to the next installment with Milo, Alex, Robin, Blanche (their French Bulldog), and the usual gang.\n\n- **Author’s Craft and Storytelling:**\n   - Jonathan Kellerman’s ability to craft engaging mysteries and develop characters remains impressive. This story stands out as one of his best.\n\n- **Acknowledgments and Publication Details:**\n   - I want to thank NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group ~ Ballantine Books for granting me this early uncorrected proof. The official publishing release date is scheduled for February 6, 2024.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis installment of the Alex Delaware series is a compelling and well-crafted mystery that continues to deliver on character development, engaging plots, and fresh ideas. Jonathan Kellerman’s storytelling remains top-notch, and this story feels like one of his best. I’m already excited for the next book in the series.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- My Rating: 4.4 stars (though I believe it deserves 5 stars)."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Familiarity:**  \n   - Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis are back and as good as ever.  \n   - Alex is a child psychologist married to an artist, Robin, and Milo is an LAPD detective who happens to be gay.  \n   - The book reveals little things about the protagonists and their relationship, which adds depth.  \n   - I appreciate having read some of the previous books in the series, as it gave me an inside track on the characters.  \n   - I would love to see a little more character change over the series.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n   - The story begins with Alex recovering from an illness and Milo being hesitant about involving him in another murder investigation.  \n   - The central mystery involves the murder of a man and woman having a tryst, with the initial uncertainty about which one was the target.  \n   - The whodunit aspect is engaging and keeps the reader interested.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Standalone Potential:**  \n   - While this is part of a long-running series, the books can be read out of order, and not all of them need to be read.  \n   - I have not read all the books in the series but still enjoyed this one.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The book is a solid four-star read.  \n   - There are some places where the prose and/or dialogue could be tightened up for better flow.  \n\n- **Author’s Ability to Sustain Interest:**  \n   - It must be challenging to write 39 novels about the same two characters doing similar things, but Kellerman manages to keep the reader engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read that brought back the beloved characters of Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis in a compelling mystery. While I would appreciate more character development over the series and some tightening of the prose, the book maintained my interest and left me eager to read the next installment. I may even revisit some earlier books in the series when I have the time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 4 stars.  \n\nThanks to NetGalley and Ballantine Books for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."

This is the type of case where Alex is especially helpful to Milo, and their collaboration is central to solving the crime.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The protagonists, Milo and Alex, have a convincing partnership. Milo feels guilty four months after their last case together resulted in serious injury to Alex, but he knows his friend is more than ready to get involved once more. I also appreciate the mature, long-term relationship between Alex and Robin.\n\n- **Narration and Pacing:**  \n  Alex narrates the detailed story of how he and Milo sift through the clues together, applying their skill and insight to solve an impossible crime with multiple suspects. The meaning of the book's title doesn't become evident until more than halfway through the story, but that worked for me.\n\n- **Subplot and Resolution:**  \n  In a secondary plot, Alex tackles a difficult custody battle where neither spouse seems to want to continue parenting their adopted 15-year-old son.

            "The case begins seemingly straightforward but quickly spirals into a captivating enigma. Two individuals—a man and a woman—are found murdered, and the primary question becomes which one was the intended target and which was collateral damage. As Alex and Milo delve into the victims' backgrounds, the details become increasingly convoluted, leaving both them and me uncertain about the true target. The mystery is compelling and kept me guessing throughout. Additionally, Alex's involvement in a child custody evaluation introduces another layer of complexity, enriching the story without detracting from the main plot. While I found the mystery engaging, I deducted one star because the ending felt forced and contrived. The resolution lacked the organic and satisfying quality I had hoped for, which was disappointing.",
            "In this installment, the relationship between Alex and Detective Milo feels somewhat strained following the previous book. As Alex concentrates on his rehabilitation, boredom soon creeps in, and he yearns for the excitement of solving mysteries alongside Milo. When Milo eventually reaches out with a new murder case, it initially appears that he’s merely tossing Alex a lifeline rather than genuinely seeking his help. Despite this, their dynamic remains captivating, with their witty banter and unique insights enriching the narrative. Impressively, even after 39 books, their relationship continues to feel fresh and engaging.",

Initially, Alex focuses on his rehab, but boredom sets in, and he misses the thrill of solving mysteries with Milo. When Milo finally contacts Alex with a new murder case, it initially seems like Milo is just throwing Alex a bone and doesn’t truly need him. However, their dynamic remains engaging, and their repartee and individual insights continue to add depth to the story. Even after 39 books in the series, their relationship hasn’t become stale, which I appreciate.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery Development:**  \n  The case starts off seemingly straightforward but quickly escalates into something larger than life. Two people—a man and a woman—are found murdered, and the central puzzle becomes determining which one was the actual target and which was collateral damage. As Alex and Milo investigate the victims’ backgrounds, the details grow murkier, leaving them (and me) unconvinced about the true target. The mystery itself is intriguing and kept me guessing throughout.  \n\n- **Pacing and Subplots:**  \n  In addition to the main murder case, Alex is also involved in a child custody evaluation, which adds another layer of complexity to the story. While this subplot keeps Alex busy, it doesn’t detract from the main mystery and instead enriches the narrative.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  While I found the mystery engaging, I deducted one star because the ending felt too forced and contrived. The solution didn’t feel as organic or satisfying as I had hoped, which was a bit disappointing.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Anticipation:**  \n  Despite the ending, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and can’t wait for the next installment in the series. These stories are always a worthwhile read, and I look forward to seeing where Alex and Milo’s journey takes them next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book delivers another compelling mystery with the beloved duo of Alex and Milo. While the ending felt a bit forced, the intriguing plot, engaging character dynamics, and well-developed subplots make it a worthwhile read.

He comes from a quirky Italian family and had been sent to California to find his path.

            "The novel centers on the double homicide of Gio Aggiunta, a wealthy playboy heir to an Italian shoe empire, and his married neighbor, Meagin March, whose bodies are discovered in Gio's Bel Air pool. Although their affair appears to provide a clear motive, the case proves to be more complex than it first seems. LAPD homicide lieutenant Milo Sturgis, despite past complications, reluctantly enlists the help of his psychologist friend, Alex Delaware, to navigate the twists of this unconventional investigation.",
            "Reading *The Ghost Orchid* feels like reconnecting with old friends, Alex and Milo. The novel offers a glimpse into their current lives, but it lacks any groundbreaking revelations. Although I appreciate the deeper exploration of Alex’s expertise in child psychology, it ultimately doesn’t add much significance to his character.",

The resolution feels overly coincidental, especially with a crucial item discovered in an implausible location. The slow pacing, burdened by an excessive focus on unlikely possibilities, detracts from the overall tension and urgency.

Overall, the conclusion lacks the depth and impact one would expect, leaving loose ends and unanswered questions.",

Additionally, the relationship between the main character and a key figure—who possessed a significant personal item—was not sufficiently developed, rendering their trust in one another unconvincing. A young character with a compelling backstory was also underutilized, wasting his potential for future involvement."

The slow pacing, contrived resolution, and underdeveloped character arcs made it a weaker entry in the series. While I remain a fan of Alex and Milo, this story didn’t live up to their usual standards.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars, rounded down."

            "The plot features several noticeable gaps, particularly in the absence of DNA searches to identify victims early on, which feels like a forced omission to propel the story. Additionally, the resolution hinges on a deus ex machina moment, where an obscure lawyer produces a box of documents that conveniently clarifies the entire mystery, undermining the investigative efforts of Alex and Milo. A subplot involving an adopted teenage boy ties back to Alex but feels disconnected from the main narrative. While some outcomes are predictable, the resolution in the final chapter is both unexpected and unsatisfactory, irrelevant to Alex's psychological evaluation, rendering the subplot pointless. The story is hampered by excessive indecision, with numerous unproductive internet searches and phone calls that slow the pace and diminish tension. Furthermore, the climactic capture of the killer occurs without Alex or Milo's direct involvement, disappointing readers who enjoyed their active participation in dangerous confrontations in previous books.",

Robin persuades Milo to bring Alex into a new case that initially appears straightforward—a jealous husband is suspected of murdering his unfaithful wife, Meagin March, and her younger lover. However, as Milo delves into Meagin's background, the narrative takes a twist. Meagin's true identity is cleverly unveiled through an anagram: her name is a puzzle (Meagin = enigma). It turns out that she was once a professional before marrying her affluent spouse. The discovery of another murder victim, killed with the same weapon, leads Milo to connect the dots, especially upon learning that Meagin had links to the victim. A revelation from the maid about a box entrusted to her by Meagin provides crucial insights, ultimately shedding light on Meagin's tragic backstory and the motive behind the murders.",

After she reports him, he takes the tragic step of killing himself and their mother, resulting in Meagin and her siblings being placed in foster care. This setup introduces emotional complexity, particularly as her youngest brother, consumed by resentment, seeks revenge against his older siblings. Meanwhile, Alex grapples with his own subplot, centered on an adopted boy abandoned by his parents after their divorce, which underscores Alex's both professional and personal struggles.",

            "The novels consistently follow a familiar formula: a murder occurs under unusual circumstances, prompting homicide detective Milo Sturgis to enlist the help of child psychologist Alex Delaware. Each story also includes a subplot involving a child custody case that Alex is handling. The mysteries are typically solved through a blend of Alex's intuitive insights and traditional police work, aided by his connections with psychologists and social workers for additional information. As the backgrounds of the murder victims are gradually revealed, unexpected twists arise. However, this particular installment feels less thrilling than earlier ones; the mystery unfolds in a more linear and predictable manner. Unlike previous narratives, neither Alex nor Milo faces significant danger, which diminishes the suspense and excitement. The absence of violence and high-stakes scenarios ultimately makes the story feel less intense.",

The plot takes a twist when someone else connected to Meghin is killed in the same manner.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Development:**  \n  Alex Delaware, as always, provides insightful assistance in questioning and unraveling the case. However, it’s not Delaware who figures out part of the key to Meghin's mystery, which adds an interesting layer to the story. Additionally, Delaware's subplot involving his commitment to a teen whose parents are divorcing, while somewhat superfluous to the main plot, adds depth to his character.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The narrative is \"nicely twisty,\" keeping the reader engaged throughout. The pacing is well-balanced, making it a compelling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a terrific read, with Kellerman delivering a gripping mystery, well-developed characters, and a plot full of twists. While it fits seamlessly into the series, it also stands strong on its own.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo explicit rating scores are mentioned in the review, but the overall tone is highly positive, describing the book as \"terrific.\""

Compounding her trauma, Meagin's brother, resentful of her role in the family's demise, murdered their other sibling as well.\n\nMeanwhile, a double homicide involving two lovers unfolds. Milo is tasked with uncovering whether the male or female was the intended target.

The relationship between Milo and Alex is a highlight, but I wished for more focus on their dynamic and emotional growth.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "I appreciated that the book steered clear of excessive focus on Alex's daily life, which is often a trend in this genre. Instead, the story's emphasis on the case made it more engaging. However, some in-depth descriptions, such as those of the women Alex meets—like the details about Rikki's thong—felt unnecessary.

There was also a custody case involved, but it seemed like filler and didn’t add much to the main plot.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  Milo and Alex were the investigators, and their methods were solid and wide-ranging. Meg March was a fascinating character due to her mysterious past and her unconventional marriage.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The story was a great read, with a well-paced narrative that kept me engaged.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was an engaging and well-crafted mystery, with a compelling plot and intriguing characters. While the custody case felt like unnecessary filler, the main storyline and the enigma of Meg March made it a great read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their teamwork and chemistry were highlights of the story, making them a strong and likable duo.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was a good ride overall, the inclusion of the adopted boy subplot felt like an unnecessary distraction from the otherwise solid main storyline. The dynamic between Milo and Alex was a standout element that kept me engaged.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 stars."

The police procedural format, with its focus on Milo and Alex’s partnership, is engaging, particularly in how they uncover the victims’ stories. However, the lack of suspense and the awkwardly integrated subplot detract slightly from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review."

The story could have benefited from a stronger focus on mystery-solving elements.  \n\n- **Characterization and Realism:**  \n  The author may wish to consider that not all police are innocent and not all citizens have ulterior motives. The portrayal of characters felt somewhat one-dimensional, and a more nuanced approach could have added depth to the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is one of Jonathan Kellerman’s better books, but it falls short in delivering a classic whodunnit experience and could improve with more complex character dynamics.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
