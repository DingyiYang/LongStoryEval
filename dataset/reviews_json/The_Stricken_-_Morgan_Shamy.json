The ending, where Nowan is crowned king, feels illogical, and the love interest subplot is both unnecessary and poorly executed. Cael's consistent support for Clara is undermined by his abrupt departure at the end. The romantic elements detract from the overall narrative and would have been better omitted. Additionally, there are significant plot holes, such as Clara inexplicably acquiring all five powers, especially given that Nowan lacked a center. Key events, like Clara‚Äôs mother killing her to send her to the other side, also suffer from a lack of clear motivation or explanation.",

The dynamic between Cael and Nowan, essentially two facets of the same person, shifts abruptly from animosity to reconciliation, leaving readers perplexed due to the lack of explanation. Additionally, Clara‚Äôs grandmother, introduced late as the antagonist, lacks clear motives, making her transformation into the primary villain feel unconvincing.",

To access her unique powers, she must connect her two parallel lives. As the last of her bloodline, Clara holds a singular ability. A male voice in her head, Cael, emerges to save her and guide her back to Khalom to recover her lost memories. The plot is rife with unexpected twists that consistently keep the reader guessing. The initial 50 pages brim with intense activity, which can be somewhat disorienting at first but becomes clearer as the narrative unfolds. Rather than adhering to the typical slow world-building, the story plunges directly into action, which may not resonate with readers who prefer a more gradual buildup.",

            "The plot only begins to engage with the two-lives concept after the first 25% of the novel, resulting in a disjointed and vague opening that suggests an unreliable narrator, despite this not being the author's intention. The transition into the two-lives theme feels like a jarring shift, even though it is meant to be central to the story. The pacing is uneven, with a slow start followed by abrupt narrative shifts. The ending is both unbelievable and frustrating, featuring a twist that feels out of place and fails to resonate.",
            "Clara's character is frustratingly oblivious, oscillating between overconfidence and self-doubt. The romance subplot is cringe-worthy, featuring a love triangle that feels juvenile and lacking depth, largely due to the awkward and creepy dynamic with one of the love interests. Additionally, Clara's brother's characterization is underdeveloped, especially regarding his acceptance of the drug derived from her blood. The relationship with the voice in Clara's head adds an unsettling layer, and the insta-love with the manipulative bad boy comes off as unconvincing and poorly executed. Overall, the romantic elements could have been more meaningful but ultimately miss the mark.",

            "The world-building relies heavily on exposition, with Clara providing information at convenient moments rather than through immersive storytelling. The narrative surrounding the cursed life feels underdeveloped, featuring generic descriptions and vague plot elements. Additionally, the school and training situation is unclear, lacking a defined purpose and rules.",
            "The depiction of a cursed life as hopeless and meaningless feels elitist, conveying a bleak message about everyday existence. The ending further entrenches prejudices against marginalized communities, which is concerning. However, the notion of individuals leading dual lives‚Äîsome aware of both and able to navigate between them‚Äîholds significant potential. This intriguing concept could resonate well with younger readers."

            "This story features an original and creative plot centered on 17-year-old Clara, who becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving memory-erasing storms and captive souls known as Diviners. From the outset, the narrative races forward, steadily gaining momentum and darkening in tone, which immerses the reader in its world. The book is rich with twists and turns that maintain engagement throughout. With its captivating storyline, complex characters, and a hint of romance, this is one of the most original tales I've encountered.",
            "Clara, the protagonist, initially appears somewhat immature, fixating on kisses in a way that can be irritating, though this is understandable given her youth. The characters are complex and well-developed, exploring themes of friendship, loyalty, honor, and moral conflict. The love triangle involving Clara, Cael, and Nowen is skillfully crafted, offering a fresh perspective that avoids the clich√©s often associated with this trope.",
            "The story unfolds through Clara's first-person perspective, inviting readers to experience her journey alongside her. The author masterfully crafts a unique narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns. However, the book does have some formatting issues, including missing letters at the beginning of sentences, inconsistent font sizes, and adjacent words lacking spaces. These issues should be resolved before the final release.",
            "The world-building is exceptional, featuring vivid descriptions of diverse realms and their inhabitants. I appreciated the unique abilities of the nobles, which allowed them to traverse worlds, manipulate their surroundings, and create or destroy at will. The setting is as captivating as its characters, offering unforgettable personalities and thought-provoking moral messages.",

            "The story is undeniably original, but its complexity can be overwhelming. Some elements are poorly explained or confusing, making the narrative difficult to follow. While the dreamlike quality adds depth, it also contributes to a disjointed feel. Additionally, unresolved threads and plot gaps, particularly regarding the ambiguous ending‚Äîwhether it is meant to be happy, bittersweet, or something else‚Äîleave readers wanting more clarity.",

Her swift forgiveness of those who tormented her in The White Room seems unearned and unrealistic. Additionally, inconsistencies detract from the narrative, such as Kale's inability to notice the Diviners and Nobles in Desolation and Clara's failure to grasp obvious details, like the \"NoWon\" name pun.",

The worldbuilding is rich with intriguing concepts, including memory-devouring Diviners, the enchanting town of Khalom, and Nobles wielding reality-shifting powers.

            "I enjoyed the plot of this book, which centers on Clara, a girl living in a world where daily storms erase everyone's memories except her own. She desperately seeks to save her mother after her father disappears. The story picks up quickly and keeps you engaged throughout. However, the beginning suffers from an excessive information dump, causing me to frequently flip back to recall character identities and their powers. In the chapters where Clara returns to the city, I felt as though I missed crucial details, as some events were glossed over without adequate explanation.",

It follows Clara, a girl living in a world where every day a storm comes and erases everyone's memories, except hers. She desperately tries to save her mom from these storms after her dad disappears. \n   - The story gathers pace quickly and keeps you wanting to read more. \n   - However, at the start of the book, there was too much of an information dump too quickly, and I had to keep flicking back to remember who characters were and what their powers were. \n   - In the chapters where Clara first returns to the city, I felt like I'd missed vital information as certain things were skipped over quickly without a full explanation.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I wasn't overly keen on Clara as a character. She had a slightly \"woe is me\" attitude, and I had a mental image of her being a petulant toddler stamping her foot and shouting, \"It's not fair!\" \n   - She also annoyed me a fair bit with how she seemed to focus more on her love interests than getting stuff done and saving the world.\n\n- **Magic System:**\n   - The magic system was really interesting. Each person has a \"centre\" which gives them the ability to manipulate a specific part of life - body, mind, time and space, earth, and death, which only Clara possesses.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**\n   - Apart from my dislike of Clara, I did really enjoy this book. It's definitely worth a read, and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to ARC read it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some issues with the pacing and character development, the novel offers an engaging plot and a fascinating magic system that kept me hooked.
