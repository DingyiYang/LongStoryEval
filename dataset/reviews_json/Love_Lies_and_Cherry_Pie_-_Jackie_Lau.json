            "The first half of the book is decent but exhaustive, filled with millennial angst and excessive explanations about the publishing industry and the challenges of being a writer. The pacing lags significantly, hindering the story’s momentum. However, the second half improves markedly, featuring a faster pace, meaningful relationship development, and greater insight into Mark, the male lead.",
            "Emily’s character arc is relatable, but her struggles as a writer and single woman in an expensive city feel somewhat overdone. Mark, on the other hand, lacks depth; he appears more as a white knight than a fully developed male lead. It would have benefited the narrative to include Mark’s perspective earlier, even in just a few scenes. I appreciated the exploration of family dynamics for both characters, and surprisingly, I found myself enjoying Emily’s pushy, overbearing mother.",
            "The story's meta aspect, featuring Emily as an author, provided depth but occasionally felt overdone. Its themes and humor evoke comparisons to *Bridget Jones*, *My Big Fat Greek Wedding*, and *Kim’s Convenience*, suggesting that fans of these works will likely appreciate it.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the rich descriptions of Toronto throughout the story. It was refreshing to see a Canadian author embrace their city's uniqueness instead of defaulting to the U.S. or a fictional town to cater to the American market. I appreciated how the author candidly depicted both the city's strengths and its challenges.",
            "The book powerfully captures the palpable feelings of frustration, self-doubt, and inferiority experienced by both characters. The mutual support and growth between Emily and Mark towards the end are handled exceptionally well, resulting in a satisfying conclusion."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, I rounded my rating to four stars because of my love for the Toronto setting and the satisfying ending. While the first half dragged due to excessive focus on Emily’s struggles and the publishing industry, the second half improved significantly with better pacing and character development. The book’s relatable themes, emotional depth, and Canadian content made it an enjoyable read, and I look forward to reading more from this author.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Setting and Canadian Content:**  \n   - I loved all the Toronto stuff and the rich descriptions of the city.  \n   - The references to Toronto made me so happy, especially since Canadian authors often set their books in the USA or a made-up town to appeal to the American market.  \n   - I’m glad the author didn’t shy away from portraying both the good and bad parts of living in Toronto.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The first half of the book was decent but exhausting, with a lot of millennial angst and over-explanation about the publishing industry and the struggles of being a writer.  \n   - The pacing in the first half dragged and felt bogged down, which stalled the story.  \n   - The second half was much better, with quicker pacing, actual relationship development, and more time spent getting to know Mark, the male lead.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Emily, the female lead, had a relatable character arc, but the focus on her struggles as a writer and single woman in an expensive city felt overdone at times.  \n   - Mark’s character could have been developed better; he came across as a white knight dream boyfriend rather than a fully fleshed-out male lead.  \n   - I would have liked to see Mark’s perspective earlier in the book, even if it was just a few scenes.  \n   - I enjoyed the exploration of family dynamics for both Emily and Mark, and I found myself liking Emily’s pushy and overbearing mother.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Themes:**  \n   - The book effectively portrayed palpable feelings of frustration, self-doubt, and inferiority for both characters.  \n   - The growth and mutual support between Emily and Mark towards the end were well-done and satisfying.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Relatability:**  \n   - The meta feeling of the story, with Emily being an author, added depth but sometimes felt heavy-handed.  \n   - The book’s themes and humor reminded me of *Bridget Jones*, *My Big Fat Greek Wedding*, and *Kim’s Convenience*, which I think fans of those works would enjoy.  \n\n- **Publishing and Marketing:**  \n   - I appreciate that the book was published under the Canadian arm of Simon & Schuster and set in Canada.  \n   - I was frustrated that the Goodreads giveaway didn’t include Canada, which feels ironic for a Canadian book.  \n   - I’m thrilled to have received a physical copy for review and excited about the recognition of Canadian reviewers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I rounded my rating to four stars because of my love for the Toronto setting and the satisfying ending. While the first half dragged due to excessive focus on Emily’s struggles and the publishing industry, the second half improved significantly with better pacing and character development. The book’s relatable themes, emotional depth, and Canadian content made it an enjoyable read, and I look forward to reading more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Solid 3.5, rounded up to 4 stars for the Canadian content and ending."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author and Anticipation:**  \n  It had been a long time since I last read a book by Jackie Lau, so when I saw *Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie* was coming out, I knew I had to read it.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Structure:**  \n  The story is told from the viewpoints of both Emily and Mark, though the majority is through Emily’s perspective. I really enjoyed this dual perspective, as well as how each chapter started with a relevant quote that tied into the chapter’s theme.  \n\n- **Romance and Tropes:**  \n  This romance features my favorite trope of fake dating, which was executed wonderfully. It made me laugh several times while also tugging at my heartstrings, as a good romance should.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook is narrated by Catherine Ho and Feodor Chin. Ho is one of my favorite narrators, while Chin was new to me. Together, they were perfect as the voices of Emily and Mark, and their performances added so much to the story.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  Family plays a significant role in the storyline. Emily’s mom, in particular, was both frustrating and endearing, driving Emily up the wall while also adding a layer of sweetness to the story.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Humor:**  \n  The phenomenal banter between the characters and Mark’s cat were highlights for me. I totally teared up at the end, and the humor throughout kept me thoroughly entertained.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  This is a great choice if you’re in the mood for a romance that is light, quick, heartwarming, and amusing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie* is a delightful romance that combines humor, heart, and a touch of family drama. With its engaging dual perspectives, excellent narration, and charming fake-dating trope, it’s a book that will leave you smiling and maybe even shedding a tear or two.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.25/5"

            "The story is a fast-paced and enjoyable read, though the abrupt shift to Mark’s perspective halfway through feels jarring. While dual points of view are generally appreciated, a smoother transition would have better maintained the reader’s connection with Emily. Centered on a 30-something fake dating romance, the novel follows Emily and Mark as they navigate a relationship orchestrated to appease their meddling parents. As initial misunderstandings and misjudgments give way to genuine feelings, the fake dating trope introduces chaotic family dynamics that add depth and humor to the narrative.",

Initially, Mark comes off as uptight and reserved, but he gradually reveals a softer, more relatable side. While Emily's initial judgment of Mark feels somewhat exaggerated, their eventual compatibility develops naturally and is satisfying. However, Mark's character could benefit from greater depth; beyond his cat ownership and penchant for sweater vests, he lacks distinct traits. Meanwhile, Emily's intrusive mother and meddling sisters add emotional complexity and humor, effectively illustrating the pressures of familial expectations. The resulting chaotic family dynamic from the fake dating scheme is both entertaining and relatable.",

The fake dating trope added an enjoyable twist, and the pace picked up once it came into play. I particularly loved the moment when their relationship felt real rather than staged.

It centers on Emily, a 33-year-old author and barista, who enters a fake dating arrangement with Mark Chan to appease her meddling mother. While I enjoyed the fake dating trope, the miscommunication aspect was less appealing.",

In contrast, Mark is sweet, patient, and slightly uptight, providing a humorous counterbalance to Emily's pessimism.

When Emily and Mark face pressure from their parents to date, they embark on a rocky start that leads to a fake relationship. The narrative delves into self-doubt, insecurities, and a recurring victim mentality, particularly with Emily’s character. The initial 30% of the book can be a struggle due to Emily's unlikable traits.

Her constant belief that everyone pities her for being an author feels overdone.  \n   - Mark is portrayed as a cat dad and initially seen as stuffy and boring by Emily.  \n   - Emily’s sister, Allison, is depicted as unsupportive and unkind, making her a disliked character.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The book takes time to get into, with the first 30% being a struggle due to Emily’s unlikable traits.  \n   - After the 30% mark, the story becomes more engaging, with enjoyable interactions between Emily and Mark.  \n   - The introduction of a new POV adds excitement and depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Romantic Dynamics:**  \n   - The enemies-to-lovers trope is well-executed, with Emily and Mark’s relationship evolving from hostility to genuine connection.  \n   - The fake dating trope adds tension and humor, though more scenes of them thriving together would have been appreciated.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetitiveness:**  \n   - The writing effectively captures the characters’ emotions and growth, but some themes (e.g., Emily’s insecurities) feel repetitive.  \n   - The focus on Emily’s self-doubt overshadows the romance at times, making the pacing uneven.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has a strong start with its engaging tropes (fake dating, enemies-to-lovers), Emily’s initial unlikability and repetitive themes of self-doubt make it a slow burn. However, once the story picks up, the interactions between Emily and Mark are delightful, and the introduction of a new POV adds depth. The book could have benefited from more focus on their relationship and less on Emily’s insecurities. Overall, it’s a enjoyable read with some pacing and character-related flaws.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 Stars."

            "This charming romcom, set in Toronto, follows Emily, a struggling writer who faces familial pressure to date Mark Chan, a man who comes across as uninterested and mundane. To appease her family, Emily decides to fake a relationship with Mark, raising the question of whether their charade might develop into something genuine. The slow-burn romance gradually heats up, with an engaging and humorous plot that perfectly captures the essence of the romcom genre.",
            "The story's Canadian context, particularly from a second-generation perspective, is both intriguing and humorous.",
            "The writing style is engaging and well-executed. However, the transition from Emily's single point of view to a dual perspective that includes Mark's midway through the book feels somewhat jarring. Although the author’s reasoning for this shift is clear, the narrative would likely have been stronger with a consistent single POV.",
            "This book skillfully delves into the themes of familial and societal expectations regarding marriage and children, particularly for those in their early thirties. The depiction of a struggling writer’s life adds depth to the narrative, evoking parallels with works like *Yellowface*, though the storyline is distinctly different.",

The story revolves around Emily’s decision to fake a relationship with Mark to appease her family, leading to questions about whether their fake relationship will evolve into something real. The slow-burn romance eventually becomes spicy, and the plot is engaging and humorous, fitting the romcom genre perfectly.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are well-developed, particularly Emily, whose struggles as a writer and her experiences with familial expectations feel authentic and relatable. Mark Chan, initially portrayed as uninteresting, reveals more depth as the story progresses.

The portrayal of a struggling writer’s life is prominent and adds depth to the story, drawing parallels to works like *Yellowface* (though with a completely different storyline).  \n\n- **Writing Style and POV:**  \n  The writing style is engaging and well-executed, though the shift from a single POV (Emily’s) to a dual POV (including Mark’s) midway through the book felt a bit jarring. While the author’s reasoning for this shift is understandable, the story might have worked better with a consistent single POV.  \n\n- **Humor and Tone:**  \n  The book is genuinely funny, balancing humor with heartfelt moments, and successfully delivers on the “rom” and “com” aspects of the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a highly enjoyable romcom with well-crafted characters, relatable themes, and a mix of humor and spice. While the POV shift was a minor drawback, the engaging plot and writing style make it a worthwhile read.

Her emotions and actions feel authentic, and her struggles as a millennial in Toronto are portrayed convincingly, even if I can't personally relate just yet. As someone from an Asian background, I particularly resonated with her complicated family dynamics. The development of Emily and Mark’s relationship is commendably written, showcasing a slow-burn connection and thoughtful communication. Mark’s sweetness and his cat are definite pluses. However, I would have liked to see more depth in Mark’s character.",

Unfortunately, the latter chapters seem to reflect a different style, making it difficult to distinguish between the characters' voices.",
            "In this story, Emily, the protagonist and a writer, is portrayed as overly judgmental and fixated on a few topics, which makes it difficult to connect with her throughout much of the narrative. Mark's character is underdeveloped, lacking depth in both his profession and personal life. While Emily’s friend, who moves in with her new boyfriend, displays toxic behavior, she is never held accountable, which adds to the frustration. In contrast, Emily's mother emerges as a standout character; I found her personality and background truly resonant, even though she is quite different from my own mother.",

            "Emily shines as a compelling female lead, navigating her quest for validation in the challenging art world. Her struggles are relatable, complemented by the likable Mark, whose perspective adds depth. The enjoyable chemistry and playful banter between Emily and Mark elevated the story. However, the focus on Emily's internal conflicts and family dynamics overshadowed Mark's development, leaving their romance feeling somewhat unearned. While they connect by the end, a lack of heartfelt moments hinders the emotional impact. A more balanced exploration of both characters' journeys and deeper romantic interactions would have enhanced the overall experience.",

            "The story centers on Emily, who faces pressure from her mother to marry Mark Chan.

The progression from this pretense to genuine feelings is both charming and well-executed, capturing the essence of what makes great fake dating narratives so appealing.",
            "Emily is a well-rounded character who navigates her love for family, duty, and the desire to remain true to herself. She seeks recognition for her work and dreams from those around her. Her relationships, though sometimes dysfunctional, are rooted in support and humor, particularly with her family and friends. Her eventual acceptance of her feelings for Mark is both charming and relatable. \n\nMark is practical and no-nonsense, with a structured personality that contrasts with Emily's free spirit. Despite his frustrations, he becomes drawn to women who differ from him. As the story unfolds, he gradually dismantles his emotional barriers to pursue his desires, adding a playful and endearing layer to his character, even in romantic moments. \n\nThe fake dating trope is executed seamlessly, evolving from pretense to genuine feelings in a natural and satisfying manner.

While her complaints are often relatable and justified—like her frustration with her sister expecting her to drop everything for her kids, her mother meddling in her love life, and the challenges of rising living costs—her fear of embarrassment over her fake relationship with Mark feels exaggerated. A simple explanation would likely have sufficed, allowing the narrative to progress more smoothly.

She complains quite a bit, though most of her complaints are relatable and justified. For example, her frustration with her sister expecting her to drop everything to take care of her kids, her mom meddling in her love life, and the cost of living are all valid. However, her belief that people finding out about her and Mark’s fake relationship would be the most embarrassing thing ever felt unrealistic. It seemed like a simple explanation would have sufficed, and everyone would have moved on.  \n\n- **Love Interest (Mark):**  \n  Mark was a pretty boring character. He had a few funny moments, and I appreciated that he liked his cat, but overall, there was nothing remarkable about him. The attempt to portray him as a gentleman in public and a sexy/domineering figure in private fell flat. The spicy scenes were underwhelming, lasting only a couple of sentences, and felt awkward to read.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story had some potential, but certain elements felt forced. For instance, the cherry pie imagery seemed unnecessary and didn’t add much to the plot. If the characters had made the pie during the baking class, it might have had more significance.

Aside from what Emily's mom mentioned, I felt like we didn’t get to truly understand his character until about halfway through the book.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The book was an easy, enjoyable read with a sweet and lighthearted tone. It was quick to get through, making it perfect for a relaxing read.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  - Despite the minor issue with Mark's character development, I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, sweet read with a fake dating theme.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful and relatable read, especially with its realistic take on the fake dating trope and its Toronto setting. While I wished for more insight into Mark's character earlier on, Emily and Mark's story was engaging and enjoyable. It’s a great choice for anyone seeking a lighthearted, quick romance.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nLove, Lies and Cherry Pies: ★★★☆☆ (3)"

I particularly enjoyed the development of the relationship between Emily and her mom, which added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Description:**  \n  While I liked Emily as a character, I struggled to create a good visual for her because the author doesn’t describe what she looks like.  \n\n- **Attention to Detail:**  \n  I appreciated the small but meaningful detail of Emily having the characters wash their hands before cooking, which added a touch of realism and thoughtfulness to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a charming and unique story with well-developed characters and thoughtful details. While I wish there had been more physical description of Emily, the relationships and small touches made the story enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The chemistry between the two leads, Emily and Mark, is disappointingly lackluster for a romance novel. Emily, a 33-year-old writer, comes off as judgmental, irritating, and excessively self-critical about her single status, making it difficult to invest in her narrative. Mark, on the other hand, lacks depth and personality; his life revolves around his cat, and his reasons for entering a fake relationship with Emily remain vague. Additionally, Emily's family is intrusively involved in her personal life, which feels unrealistic and detracts from the central romance, shifting the focus to family dynamics instead.",
            "Emily’s profession as a writer feels underdeveloped and irrelevant to the plot, while her role as a barista is overly emphasized, creating a disconnect with her character. The title's reference to pie also feels like a missed opportunity, as neither character engages with baking, which could have added depth to the story."

        "conclusion": "This book was a disappointment. The lack of chemistry between the leads, underdeveloped characters, and an empty plot made it feel like a waste of time. While the writing itself wasn’t bad, the story lacked purpose and failed to deliver a compelling romance.",

Her personality made it hard to care about her story.  \n   - Mark lacks personality and depth. His life revolves around his cat, and his motivations for entering a fake relationship with Emily are unclear.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The story felt like 300 pages of nothing, with no clear direction or purpose.  \n   - The single POV (Emily’s) switches to Mark’s perspective later, but his POV adds nothing to the story.  \n   - The romance felt empty, and the transition from no chemistry to sex was abrupt and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n   - Emily’s profession as a writer is underdeveloped and irrelevant to the plot. Instead, her barista job is emphasized, which feels disconnected from her character.  \n   - The title references pie, but neither character is a baker, making it feel like a missed opportunity for a more engaging theme.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n   - Emily’s family is overly involved in her personal life, to the point of being intrusive and unrealistic.  \n   - The focus on her family’s meddling detracts from the main romance and makes the story feel like it should have been about family dynamics instead.  \n\n- **Romantic and Intimate Scenes:**  \n   - The sex scenes were poorly written and lacked emotional or physical depth. Both characters finish in one stroke, making the scenes feel rushed and unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointment.

I found intriguing parallels to *Pride and Prejudice*, especially in the family dynamics and the misunderstood male lead, which enriched the narrative.",

While this characterization felt exaggerated, I appreciated her eventual acknowledgment of her behavior and apology in the latter part of the book, which indicated personal growth. Mark is portrayed as supportive and patient—ideal on paper—but his perspective lacks depth, making it hard to connect with him emotionally. The chemistry between Emily and Mark feels insufficient, and their connection doesn't resonate strongly. Nevertheless, I found the happy ending satisfying.",

            "The novel follows Emily, who feels pressured by her mother to marry and ultimately becomes embroiled in a fake dating scheme with Mark Chan. Initially, Emily harbors a strong dislike for Mark, but as the story progresses, her feelings evolve into affection. The narrative shifts in the second half to include Mark's point of view, adding depth and complexity to their romance. \n\nThe first half of the book focuses on Emily's struggles as a writer, her family dynamics, and her feelings of inadequacy, but it tends to be slower-paced with repetitive reflections on her challenges. In contrast, the second half gains momentum with Mark's insights, enriching the story. While the ending resolves family conflicts effectively, the romance feels somewhat underdeveloped. However, the epilogue delivers a satisfying happily-ever-after that leaves readers content.",
            "Emily is a relatable character, especially for writers disillusioned with the publishing industry. However, her repetitive complaints about her career and family dynamics can become tiresome. Initially, Mark seems uptight and judgmental, but as the story unfolds, he reveals a more playful and emotionally complex side. Emily’s growth is evident as she learns to stand up for herself and resolves misunderstandings with her family and Mark. Their romance develops gradually, with chemistry building from fake dating to a genuine relationship. Mark’s teasing and unexpected behavior add charm to their interactions, although his point-of-view chapters often focus more on physical attraction than emotional depth. The open-door romantic scenes feel somewhat forced, relying on good girl tropes that don’t entirely resonate.",
            "The novel leans towards women's fiction, emphasizing Emily's personal journey and family dynamics over traditional romance. Themes of career struggles, family expectations, and self-discovery underscore Emily's growth. While the inclusion of social media references and writer-related challenges may resonate with certain readers, it also risks quickly dating the book."

        "conclusion": "*Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie* is a charming fake-dating story with a strong focus on Emily's personal growth and family dynamics. While the romance is enjoyable, it takes a backseat to the women's fiction elements, making it more of a life journey with a romantic subplot. The inclusion of Mark's perspective adds depth, though the emphasis on physical attraction over emotional connection may not appeal to all readers. Overall, it’s a relatable and engaging read, particularly for writers or those navigating family pressures and career challenges.",

However, her repetitive complaints about her career and family dynamics became tiresome.  \n   - Mark is initially perceived as uptight and judgmental, but his character evolves as the story progresses, revealing a more playful and emotionally complex side.  \n   - Emily's growth involves standing up for herself and resolving misunderstandings with her family and Mark.  \n\n- **Romance and Chemistry:**  \n   - The romance develops gradually, with Emily and Mark's chemistry becoming more apparent as they move from fake dating to a real relationship.  \n   - Mark's teasing and unexpected behavior add charm to their interactions, though his point-of-view chapters leaned more toward physical attraction than emotional depth.  \n   - The open-door romantic scenes felt somewhat forced, with a focus on \"good girl\" tropes that didn't entirely resonate.  \n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n   - The novel leans more toward women's fiction/chick-lit, focusing on Emily's personal journey and family dynamics rather than a traditional romance.  \n   - Themes include career struggles, family expectations, and self-discovery, with a strong emphasis on Emily's growth.  \n   - The inclusion of social media references and writer-related struggles may appeal to specific audiences but risks dating the book quickly.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The first half is slower, with repetitive reflections on Emily's career and family issues.  \n   - The second half introduces Mark's perspective, which adds momentum and depth to the story.  \n   - The ending resolves family conflicts but leaves the romance feeling slightly underdeveloped, though the epilogue provides a satisfying happily-ever-after (HEA).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie* is a charming fake-dating story with a strong focus on Emily's personal growth and family dynamics. While the romance is enjoyable, it takes a backseat to the women's fiction elements, making it more of a life journey with a romantic subplot. The inclusion of Mark's perspective adds depth, though the emphasis on physical attraction over emotional connection may not appeal to all readers. Overall, it’s a relatable and engaging read, particularly for writers or those navigating family pressures and career challenges.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot and Storyline: 4/5  \n- Character Development: 3.5/5  \n- Romance and Chemistry: 3.5/5  \n- Genre and Themes: 4/5  \n- Pacing and Structure: 3.5/5  \n**Overall Rating:** 3.7/5"

            "The book's unique structure, featuring Emily's POV in the first half and introducing Mark's later, proves to be effective. This design facilitates gradual character development and keeps the reader engaged as Emily and Mark's relationship unfolds.",
            "Emily’s family, especially her larger-than-life mother, injects humor and charm into the story. While her mother is overly invested in Emily’s single status, her intentions are always genuine, making her endearing despite her meddling. The dynamics between Emily and her family are entertaining and relatable, showcasing the complexities of their relationships.\n\nEmily and Mark, the main characters, offer a delightful contrast in personalities that leads to amusing misunderstandings. Their witty banter, fueled by first impressions—Emily considers Mark a snob while his true feelings are revealed later—adds depth to their relationship. Mark’s quiet kindness and genuine admiration for Emily’s writing career make him a compelling love interest.\n\nEmily’s journey intertwines her romantic ambitions with family dynamics, particularly her decision to leave her job to pursue writing. The tension with her family arises from miscommunication rather than malice, emphasizing their misunderstandings. The romance is engaging, featuring well-executed tropes like fake dating, one-bed, and opposites attract. The fake-dating element is particularly humorous, with Emily and Mark going to great lengths to convince their parents of their relationship. Mark's quiet yet passionate nature, along with his early feelings for Emily, adds both sweetness and spark to the romance.",

            "Emily's character comes across as unlikable, not in a complex or misunderstood manner, but rather due to her constant complaints and lack of warmth toward others. Her moments of depth, such as babysitting for her sister, are too few to make her relatable or endearing. Mark's character is similarly underdeveloped; with Emily dominating the first half of the book, his struggles and personality beyond their interactions are scarcely explored, hindering a deeper connection with him. The dialogue and chemistry between Emily and Mark lack spark, rendering their attraction unconvincing. While Emily's interest in Mark feels somewhat believable due to his efforts to win her over, Mark’s feelings for Emily are less developed and come across as one-sided.",
            "The romance lacked emotional depth. While love doesn't always need to be grand or dramatic, the characters failed to step out of their comfort zones in ways that truly conveyed their feelings. Emily's moments of vulnerability felt too fleeting to leave a lasting impact."

            "The story lacked depth, leading me to skim through the final 150 pages without losing track of the plot. While there were some decent moments, overall, the narrative felt tiring and unengaging.",
            "The characters in the story felt flat, and their actions often lacked logical consistency. Emily's sudden transition from being mean to Mark to professing her love for him came across as abrupt and unconvincing. Mark's character was equally inconsistent, shifting from a shy, nerdy persona to randomly winking and fixating on Emily inappropriately, which felt out of character. The development of their relationship was rushed and superficial. Additionally, the supporting kids were somewhat annoying, though not inherently problematic. The introduction of too many names made it difficult to keep track of the characters and their relationships, further diminishing my engagement with the story.",

I found Emily's perspective tolerable, and it eventually grew on me by the end of the first part. However, Mark's perspective was disappointing; his inner thoughts felt disjointed and poorly crafted, as if someone unfamiliar with him had written them.

It didn’t align with his character, and I preferred him more through Emily’s perspective.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The characters felt bland, and their actions often didn’t make sense.  \n   - Emily’s sudden shift from being mean to Mark to declaring her love for him felt abrupt and unconvincing.  \n   - Mark’s personality seemed inconsistent—he went from being a shy, nerdy guy to randomly winking and thinking about Emily’s nipples, which felt out of character.  \n   - The relationship development felt rushed and lacked depth.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Depth:**  \n   - The story lacked depth, and I found myself skimming the last ~150 pages, which didn’t affect my understanding of the plot.  \n   - The plot itself had moments that weren’t bad, but overall, it felt tiring and unengaging.  \n\n- **Side Characters and World-Building:**  \n   - The kids in the story were somewhat annoying, though there was nothing inherently wrong with them.  \n   - There were too many names introduced, and because I was already disengaged, I struggled to keep track of who was who and their relationships to each other.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n   - I appreciated the Canadian/Toronto/GTA references, as they added a unique touch to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some redeeming moments and cultural elements I enjoyed, the writing style, inconsistent character development, and lack of depth made it a tiring read for me. I can see why others might like it, but it didn’t work for me personally.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Initial rating: 3.1 stars (might drop to 2 stars).  \n- Overall, the book was a 1/3 for me in terms of enjoyment."

            "The premise of a fake relationship to satisfy family expectations starts off engaging but soon veers into the territory of contrived absurdity. The shift from fake dating to genuine romance is predictable, and Emily's exaggerated anxiety about being discovered feels both unrealistic and excessive. The plot leans heavily on misunderstandings and poor communication, which, while a staple in romance, becomes frustratingly repetitive in this story.",
            "This story draws heavily from *Pride & Prejudice*, featuring Emily, a struggling writer and the last unmarried daughter in a family of five, and Mark Chan, a socially awkward yet financially stable suitor reminiscent of Fitzwilliam Darcy. While Emily's character is enriched by her societal pressures to marry, it also leads to frustrating moments of immaturity. In contrast, Mark emerges as a near-perfect character—selfless, kind, and openly affectionate—which provides a grounding balance to Emily’s indecisiveness. The first half of the book is bogged down by Emily's tiresome internal monologue, but the narrative gains momentum in the second half through Mark’s perspective, resulting in a more engaging experience. However, Mark’s lack of flaws and growth by the story's conclusion leaves a sense of missed potential for deeper character development.",
            "The writing often feels heavy-handed, with a plot that seems forced and contrived. However, the introduction of Mark’s perspective in the second half significantly enhances the narrative flow and overall enjoyment of the story.",
            "The novel draws heavily on *Pride & Prejudice* but offers a contemporary twist that ultimately feels superficial. While the reimagined dynamics, such as Mark's reduced arrogance compared to Darcy, provide a fresh perspective, they are not fully developed, lacking the depth of the original."

        "conclusion": "While the novel has its moments, particularly through Mark’s charming and balanced perspective, it struggles with a contrived plot, frustrating character decisions, and heavy-handed writing. Emily’s immaturity and the lack of growth in Mark’s character detract from the overall experience. However, Mark’s likability and the second-half shift in perspective elevate the story enough to make it a somewhat enjoyable read.",

            "This book distinguishes itself by avoiding the typical \"book within a book\" narrative. Instead, it centers on Emily's journey as she navigates the reality of her readers, steering clear of jumping between dual storylines. The slow-burn romance culminates in satisfying open-door moments and a delightful happily ever after.",
            "I immediately connected with Emily on the first page; Millennials will find their experiences reflected in this modern take on dating. As a barista living with a roommate in Toronto, Emily is proud of her work and willing to make sacrifices for her dreams. Her anxiety about her family's reactions to her book—especially her mother's take on the sex scene—adds depth and leads to one of the book's best reveals. The fake dating trope is cleverly executed, even if it's odd to pretend to date someone your mom tried to set you up with. The transition from pretense to genuine feelings is both tender and engaging. Mike Chan, the male love interest, is supportive, understanding, and often misjudged, which only makes me root for their relationship even more.",
            "This story presents a mature yet optimistic love narrative that explores the importance of looking beyond first impressions, intertwined with a family drama reminiscent of the Bennets. The book also features numerous fictional nods to the contemporary publishing landscape, which may resonate with writers and influencers, though some might find it a touch self-aware.",

She works as a lowly barista and lives with a roommate to afford rent in Toronto, but she’s proud of her career and happy to make sacrifices for her dreams.  \n   - Her anxiety about her family reading her book and their reactions (e.g., her mom’s opinions about the sex scene) creates one of the best reveals at the end of the book.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Structure:**  \n   - The book redeems itself by not being a book about a book. Instead, it focuses on Emily handling the reality of people reading her work, avoiding the trope of jumping in and out of two stories.  \n   - The slow-burn romance pays off with open-door spice and a delightful HEA (happily ever after).  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n   - The fake dating trope is splendidly executed, even though it’s bizarre to fake date someone your mom tried to set you up with.  \n   - The development from faking to feeling is tender-hearted, and Mike Chan, the male love interest, is supportive, understanding, and misjudged, making me cheer for them even more.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - It’s a mature yet optimistic love story about seeing beyond first impressions, combined with a family drama worthy of the Bennets.  \n   - The book includes many fictional references to today’s publishing landscape, which writers and influencers may find fun or a little too self-aware.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The anxiety and reveals surrounding Emily’s book made the entire journey worthwhile.  \n   - The story lifts you up in the end, with a family drama and love story that feel both realistic and heartwarming.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a heartfelt and relatable story that combines a mature, optimistic love story with a family drama reminiscent of the Bennets.

            "Emily’s complaints about millennial stereotypes, particularly the frequent references to avocado toast and coffee, occasionally felt repetitive. However, the meta discussions about the publishing industry echoed themes from *Yellowface* by R. F. Kuang, adding depth to the narrative. The introduction of Mark’s perspective 190 pages in was a refreshing stylistic choice that enhanced the story. Mark's sweetness and the charm of Ms. Muffins enriched the narrative, while the portrayal of family dynamics added both realism and relatable, if sometimes frustrating, family moments.",

            "In the beginning, Emily, the protagonist, came across as bitter and excessively self-critical, particularly regarding her single status in her 30s. Her internal monologue about feeling \"ancient\" at 33 felt unappealing to me, given my own age. However, as she spent more time with Mark and began to soften, I found her more relatable and gained a deeper understanding of her struggles. Emily's relationship with her mother was complex, characterized by constant pressure surrounding marriage and matchmaking. Initially, this dynamic seemed one-sided, but it unfolded beautifully as the story progressed, revealing deeper motivations. Although I couldn't personally relate to the cultural pressures she faced, particularly from her mother, they added significant depth to both her character and the narrative."

The early chapters heavily emphasize these tensions, particularly highlighting the lack of boundaries from Emily's mother and the harsh treatment from her sister Alison, which left me feeling uncomfortable.",

While Mark's perspective, introduced later, adds interest, his character ultimately feels underdeveloped and emotionally flat, functioning more as a support for Emily than as a fully realized individual.",

            "This slow-burn, fake-dating romance blossoms into an authentic love story. It centers on Emily Hung, a writer exasperated by her mother's matchmaking, and Mark Chen, a seemingly stuffy yet kind man. To satisfy their families, Emily and Mark feign a relationship, but their staged dates soon become sincere. While the initial single perspective makes it challenging to connect with Emily, the shift to alternating viewpoints in the second half enhances pacing and deepens insights into both characters. Overall, it’s an engaging tale of evolving emotions.",

Her frustrations over her mother’s comments about marriage and her self-doubt about being “so old” in her early 30s are central to her character arc. Mark is both awkward and endearing, and his perspective, introduced in the second half, adds significant depth to the narrative. Both characters grapple with familial expectations and personal insecurities, which enhances their relatability. Initially, the romance between Emily and Mark seems forced, but it evolves into a genuine connection that showcases how they bring out the best in one another. This transformation makes their relationship both satisfying and heartwarming."

Her frustration with her mother’s comments about marriage and her self-doubt about being “so old” in her early 30s are central to her character.  \n   - Mark is portrayed as awkward yet adorable, and his perspective, introduced in the second half of the book, adds depth to the story.  \n   - Both characters struggle with family expectations and personal insecurities, making them more human and relatable.  \n\n- **Family and Cultural Dynamics:**  \n   - The novel effectively explores the influence of family expectations on both Emily and Mark.  \n   - Emily’s Chinese family and their cultural dynamics play a significant role in shaping her decisions and relationships.  \n\n- **Romantic Development:**  \n   - The romance between Emily and Mark starts as a forced arrangement but grows into a genuine connection.  \n   - Their relationship highlights how they bring out the best in each other, making the romance satisfying and heartwarming.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The story is engaging, though the single point of view in the first half made it harder to connect with Emily initially.  \n   - The switch to alternating perspectives in the second half improved the pacing and allowed for a deeper understanding of both characters.  \n\n- **Supporting Elements:**  \n   - Mark’s cat, Ms. Muffins, adds a charming and humorous touch to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love Lies and Cherry Pie* is an enjoyable fake-dating romance with well-developed characters and a satisfying romantic arc.

            "In this story, Emily, the protagonist, initially appears prickly and judgmental towards Mark, a reaction that’s understandable given her mother's relentless matchmaking attempts. While I typically dislike main characters who make excessive assumptions, I sensed Emily's potential for growth, which made her journey engaging. Mark begins as a mere object of Emily's resentment, but as her perceptions shift, he evolves into a multifaceted character. Witnessing his development was a standout aspect of the narrative.",
            "This book is funny, sweet, and spicy, with a well-crafted narrative that kept me thoroughly engaged. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't mind reading it as an e-book, despite my usual preference for audiobooks. The fake dating trope is expertly executed, and Mark's enthusiastic participation in the scheme made him instantly sympathetic. Even though Emily initially treats him poorly, his genuine interest in her reveals his \"cinnamon roll\" character, which I absolutely loved.",
            "One of my favorite subplots was Emily’s journey as an author. Her struggles and bittersweet emotions about her chosen path resonated deeply with me as an aspiring writer. The anecdotes about her writing process were both comforting and inspiring.",
            "I don’t typically read romance and usually prefer audiobooks for the genre. I also enjoy romcoms more in film than in print. However, I was intrigued to read *Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie*, especially after hearing it praised for offering “a dash of *Pride and Prejudice*.”"

The character development, engaging tropes, and relatable subplots made it a standout romance novel for me.

            "The pacing of the story is moderate to slow, largely due to the slow-burn romance and the protagonist's reluctance to accept the potential relationship. However, the engaging and relatable storyline keeps readers invested. Romantic tension only intensifies in the middle of the book, but the intricate revelations about family dynamics, particularly between mothers and daughters, are well-executed. The exploration of the challenges faced by authors in a cosmopolitan city like Toronto is particularly insightful. The balance between emotional connection and lifestyle stability resonates deeply, especially from an Asian family perspective.",

One is impulsive and rash, while the other appears calm yet is internally conflicted.",

Mark’s perspective is distinct and well-executed, effectively avoiding the common trap of dual POVs sounding too similar.

This perspective change enriches the narrative, with Mark’s voice often feeling like a direct conversation with the reader, which I found engaging. However, the first half, solely focused on Emily, felt somewhat lengthy. The story follows Emily, who, under her mother's pressure, reluctantly begins to fake-date Mark, a nerdy man in a sweater vest who doesn’t initially appeal to her. As she spends time with him, she unexpectedly develops genuine feelings. The evolution from fake dating to authentic emotions serves as a central theme of the story.",

Emily's role as an author enriches the narrative, particularly when she breaks the fourth wall to illuminate writing techniques.

The transition from fake dating to real feelings is a central theme.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Perspective:**  \n  The book is told from Emily’s single perspective in the first half and switches to dual perspectives (Emily and Mark) in the second half.

            "The story took a while to captivate me, largely because I found the family dynamics frustrating. However, the turning point was the fake relationship between Emily and Mark, which ultimately made the book more enjoyable. Their slowly evolving relationship was a standout element, skillfully sidestepping the typical traps of rushed or unrealistic romance.",

The mother's overbearing nature and the sister's dismissive attitude towards the main character's career were particularly exasperating. Although they eventually reveal themselves as misunderstood, their earlier behavior felt unjustified and difficult to overlook.",

The lack of a third-act breakup between the main couple was a welcome surprise, as the conflict stemmed from external sources rather than predictable relationship drama. The themes of cultural expectations regarding marriage and career resonated deeply with me, reflecting my own immigrant background.",

Overall, the book was enjoyable, particularly for fans of fake dating and slow-burn romances."

While some aspects of the romance and plot felt a bit underdeveloped, the unique narrative structure and satisfying ending made it an enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The storyline was engaging, enriched by the challenges of the publishing world, which added depth to the narrative. The themes of fake dating, forced proximity, and arranged relationships were well-executed, featuring a hint of steamy moments and undeniable chemistry between the characters.

Her struggle to assert her independence amid this interference is relatable, and her fraught relationship with her eldest sister adds depth to her character. The evolution of Emily and Mark’s relationship—from fake dating to friends to lovers—is entertaining and well-crafted. However, Emily’s tendency to ghost Mark multiple times was frustrating; once might have been reasonable, but the recurring behavior detracted from my enjoyment. Mark’s cat was a delightful touch, and Mark himself nicely balanced Emily’s character. Although I occasionally found Emily exasperating, Mark’s insights helped soften those moments.",

Once might have been understandable, but it happened multiple times, which I didn’t care for.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Mark’s cat was a delightful addition to the story, and Mark himself provided a nice balance to Emily’s character. While I sometimes found Emily annoying, Mark’s perspective helped soften those moments.  \n\n- **Themes and Relatability:**  \n  The themes of strained familial relationships and societal expectations resonated with me. I would recommend this book to anyone dealing with similar family dynamics or looking for a light, relatable read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute and enjoyable story with a relatable protagonist and a well-developed romantic arc. While some aspects of Emily’s behavior were frustrating, the addition of Mark’s perspective and the Canadian setting added depth and charm to the narrative. It’s a great choice for readers seeking light, escapist fiction with a touch of family drama.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book cleverly utilizes familiar tropes like fake dating, enemies-to-lovers, and nods to *Pride and Prejudice*. Although the author revisits the fake dating concept, she injects freshness by having the main characters initially avoid actual dates, instead communicating through text. During this time, Emily even dates other guys. Eventually, they move from pretend outings to genuine dates, creating an engaging evolution in their relationship.",
            "The main characters grapple with complex relationships with their parents, serving as a key source of conflict. Initially, I felt this aspect was somewhat underwhelming; however, Emily’s eventual confrontation with her mother proved satisfying and redeemed the earlier pacing.",
            "This book presents a critically engaging and enjoyable perspective on the publishing industry, which stands out as a highlight. As a writer, Emily offers valuable insights and references to recent events in publishing, making it refreshing to find these elements in a traditionally published novel rather than a self-published work.",

While this is not Jackie Lau’s first time using the fake dating trope, she keeps it fresh by having the main characters (MCs) initially avoid actual dates, relying instead on texting to maintain their fake relationship. Emily even dates other guys during this time. Eventually, they transition to real fake dates and then to genuine dates.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Both MCs have complicated relationships with their parents, which becomes a central source of conflict. While I found this aspect a bit weak initially, Emily’s eventual confrontation with her mother was satisfying and made up for the earlier pacing.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book offers a critical yet fun look at the publishing industry, which I found to be a highlight. Emily, being a writer, provides insights and references to recent events in publishing. It’s refreshing to see this included in a traditionally published novel rather than a self-published one.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Enjoyment:**  \n  As always, Jackie Lau delivers a solid romcom with lovable characters, an engaging story, and her signature “food porn.” The book was thoroughly enjoyable, and I look forward to reading more of her work.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie* is a delightful romcom that balances familiar tropes with fresh twists.

While this book has a different tone and heat level than her previous works, her voice and the Chinese-Canadian (specifically Toronto) elements really shine through.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  This is a fake-dating, dislike-to-love story with nods to *Pride and Prejudice*. It’s not a total retelling, but the nods and winks are there. The story also touches on the pandemic, current cost-of-living issues, and the housing market, which adds a layer of realism and makes the world feel lived-in without being depressing.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Emily, the protagonist, is a 33-year-old writer and barista who feels pressure from her mom and older sister to settle down or \"be more adult.\" Mark, the love interest, is someone her mom can’t stop talking about. Their meet-cute isn’t so cute—they don’t get along at first, but Emily’s mom, a true Mrs. Bennett, won’t stop talking him up. Emily and Mark reluctantly start fake dating to placate their parents, but of course, it becomes real. Lau’s characters are well-defined, funny, and relatable. The family members are also important to the story, adding depth to both the hero and heroine.  \n\n- **Setting and Details:**  \n  The book includes great descriptions of food, an adorable cat with an Instagram page, and discussions about the publishing industry. These details enrich the story and make it feel authentic.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  At times, I was frustrated by Emily’s family, just as she was, but by the end, I was really touched by how her mom was portrayed. The emotional journey felt genuine and satisfying.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I highly recommend Jackie Lau’s books, and this one is no exception! The Cherry Pie tie-in is also a cute detail—don’t worry, it’s worth it!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a delightful romance with a unique voice, relatable characters, and a realistic yet heartwarming portrayal of family dynamics and modern-day challenges. Jackie Lau’s storytelling shines, making this a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Emily Hung, the protagonist, is an outlier in her family—she’s the only sister not pursuing STEM, remains unmarried, and juggles multiple jobs as a newly published author.

Initially, I found it difficult to invest in Emily and Mark's relationship, but his perspective did enhance my engagement. Their dynamic is enjoyable, yet the lack of depth in Mark's character makes it challenging to fully believe in their connection.

Emily Hung, a thirty-three-year-old writer and barista, grapples with the marriage expectations imposed by her mother, creating a scenario that feels both believable and relatable, particularly within a cultural context. The fake dating trope is effectively employed here, as it resonates with the strong cultural and familial pressures that remain authentic and grounded throughout the story."

The family dynamics and relatable protagonist add depth, though the pacing and limited exploration of Mark’s perspective could have been improved. Overall, it’s a solid read for fans of sweeter romcoms, with enough spice to keep things interesting.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Themes:**  \n   - The novel revolves around fake dating, modern Pride and Prejudice vibes, family and marital pressures, and features a writer heroine.  \n   - The setup of Emily Hung, a thirty-three-year-old writer and barista, facing marriage pressure from her mother feels believable and relatable, especially within a cultural context.  \n   - The fake dating trope works well here because of the strong cultural and familial pressures, which feel authentic and grounded.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n   - The book leans more towards a \"sweeter\" romcom, with a balance of humor, happy moments, and some sexual tension.  \n   - While it has solid sex scenes, the overall tone is more on the sweet side, which may not appeal to readers who prefer a more \"savory\" (spicier) romcom.  \n   - The writing is well-crafted, with lovely descriptions, engaging dialogue, and strong dynamics between characters.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n   - Emily is a refreshing protagonist—thirty-three, not having her life figured out, and relatable in her struggles.  \n   - Mark Chan’s character is introduced later in the book, and his perspective isn’t fully explored until further into the story, which slows the pacing.  \n   - The family dynamics, particularly the overbearing mother and the nieces rooting for Emily, add depth and authenticity, giving strong Pride and Prejudice vibes.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n   - The pacing could have been faster, especially in the beginning, as Mark’s presence is limited early on.  \n   - The delayed introduction of Mark’s perspective and the slower buildup of their relationship might not appeal to readers who prefer quicker developments.  \n\n- **Romantic and Sexual Chemistry:**  \n   - The sexual tension and chemistry between Emily and Mark are well-developed, with a good buildup throughout the story.  \n   - The sex scenes, while explicit, are edited in a way that feels rushed, cutting quickly to other actions rather than lingering on the details.  \n   - The face-sitting scene is mentioned as a highlight, but the lack of \"luxuriating\" in the details leaves room for more exploration.  \n\n- **Cultural and Trope Relevance:**  \n   - The novel effectively uses the fake dating trope within a cultural context that feels authentic, particularly with the marriage-minded mother and the pressures Emily faces.  \n   - The discussion around fake dating tropes being more believable when tied to cultural or traditional pressures is highlighted, making this story stand out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this romcom leaned a bit too sweet for my personal taste, it is well-written, engaging, and offers a refreshing take on the fake dating trope within a culturally rich context. The family dynamics and relatable protagonist add depth, though the pacing and limited exploration of Mark’s perspective could have been improved. Overall, it’s a solid read for fans of sweeter romcoms, with enough spice to keep things interesting.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Vibes: 3.5/5  \n- Heat Index: 6/10"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed *Loves, Lies, and Cherry Pie*. The characters, especially Emily, are fantastic—I'd love for her to be my BFF. She feels so genuine and relatable that I can easily picture us going on food friend dates. She's definitely made my top five female romance characters. Mark Chan (always mentioned by his full name) was equally impressive; his logical thought process provided a nice contrast to Emily’s emotionally driven approach. I also appreciated how well-written Emily’s family was, especially her mother. Typically, meddling family members annoy me, but in this story, they added charm. The romance was a slow burn, which I appreciated. The author allowed the chemistry between Emily and Mark to develop naturally, steering away from instant attraction, though who could resist a man in sweater vests? This gradual buildup made their relationship feel more authentic.",

            "The novel opens with a promising fake dating trope in Toronto, as Emily Hung’s mother insists she meet Mark Chan. This leads to a fun arrangement that evolves into a genuine romance. While the premise is engaging, the story loses much of its humor in the second half, as the characters move from pretending to date to a real relationship. Though the author, who is new to me, provides a more thorough resolution than expected—a welcome surprise—the latter half lacks the charm and wit of the beginning, with an overall feel that the ending is somewhat rushed.",
            "Emily, a 33-year-old writer and barista, grapples with feelings of undervalue from her family and frustration over her financial struggles. Her frequent complaints about her age and living situation often come across as whiny. In contrast, Mark is kind-hearted and genuinely interested in her, although their relationship feels unbalanced; he understands her more deeply than she does him. The romance is open-door, showcasing adult characters facing real-life challenges. However, certain moments, like Emily's mother's awkward expectations during a family weekend trip, fall more flat than amusing. Additionally, a contrived near-breakup towards the end disrupts the story's flow. Overall, while the story has merit, its execution includes some missteps.",

However, the FMC's struggle to manage her emotions creates tension, culminating in a family confrontation before ultimately reaching resolution.",

Unfortunately, her behavior often comes off as annoying, judgmental, and bratty, especially towards the male main character (MMC), making it hard for readers to connect with her. The MMC, on the other hand, is a sweet, lonely guy who genuinely likes the FMC, demonstrating patience and willingness to forgive her even after she pushes him away.

            "The characters in this story feel flat and unlikable. Their inner thoughts are often vocalized immediately, leading to repetitive and pedantic writing. Mark Chan's dialogue is robotic and lacks intrigue, rendering him dull. The condescending sister harbors an unreasonable grudge against the main character for being artsy and rebellious, yet this dynamic remains undeveloped. The narrative misses an opportunity to explore the complexities of Asian family dynamics, which could have added significant depth. Additionally, the nuanced emotions surrounding being a published author—wanting your family to read your work while also fearing their judgment—are overlooked. The romance feels simplistic and lacks layers, leaving the story feeling one-dimensional.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Depth:**  \n  Jackie Lau’s writing has a sparkle that leaps off the page. While her contemporary romances appear simple on the surface, they are layered with complexity and insight.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Emily Hung, is a published author who struggles to balance her writing career with her job as a barista. Her relatable inner monologue, including her struggles with distractions like social media and funny animal videos, adds depth to her character. Mark Chan, the “suitable” match set up by Emily’s mother, is also well-developed, and his cat, Ms. Muffins, adds charm to his character.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n  The story revolves around the fake dating trope, which is executed with a fresh perspective. The predictable trajectory of the trope is elevated by the nuanced details and emotional depth woven into the narrative.  \n\n- **Setting and Cultural Context:**  \n  The novel effectively incorporates an immigrant family story set in Toronto, Canada, adding cultural richness and authenticity to the narrative.  \n\n- **Themes and Family Dynamics:**  \n  The book thoughtfully explores family dynamics, particularly the tension between Emily and her mother, who constantly intervenes in her life. The resolution of these dynamics is satisfying and adds emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Humor and Modern Relevance:**  \n  The novel’s humor, especially its accurate portrayal of internet culture and how people interact with it, is a highlight. It feels modern and relatable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nJackie Lau delivers another delightful contemporary romance with *Love, Lies, and Cherry Pie*. The novel shines through its well-developed characters, engaging plot, and thoughtful exploration of family dynamics and cultural identity. The humor and modern relevance, particularly in its portrayal of internet culture, make it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story had potential but was overly focused on Emily's grievances about the publishing industry and her relationship with her mother. As a result, the fake dating trope and the romance between Emily and Mark took a backseat, which was disappointing.",
            "I found Emily, the main female character, to be a disappointment. Her excessive complaints about her family, the publishing industry, her housing situation, and even her age (at thirty-three) felt excessive and ultimately unrelatable. This constant focus on grievances made it hard to connect with her. Additionally, the chemistry between Emily and Mark was weak; I didn’t feel invested in their relationship and didn’t care if they ended up together. Their interactions appeared forced, lacking genuine interest in one another. Mark himself was underdeveloped; aside from his adorable cat and a strained relationship with his father—which was only mentioned, not explored—he came off as flat and one-dimensional.",

            "The story is primarily narrated in the first person by Emily, the heroine. Her character is predominantly defined by her anxiety as she grapples with the Toronto housing market, the challenges of the publishing industry, and her struggles with adulting. While Mark, the hero, is likable, he lacks sufficient depth in his characterization. The most compelling aspect of the book is the evolution of Emily's relationship with her mother, culminating in a poignant resolution that adds nuance to the narrative. In contrast, the attempt to explore Emily's relationship with her older sister, Allison, feels underdeveloped due to the focus on Emily's repetitive grievances.",
            "The book consistently highlights the bleakness of the Toronto housing market and the challenges facing the publishing industry, which becomes overwhelming and tedious.",
            "The author's knack for crafting adorable child characters consistently brings humor and lightheartedness to the story, striking a perfect balance without veering into excessive sentimentality."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While I typically enjoy the author’s work, this novel felt like a slog due to its heavy focus on Emily’s repetitive anxieties about adulthood, the Toronto housing market, and the publishing industry. The standout element is the nuanced and moving resolution of Emily’s relationship with her mom, but other aspects, like her relationship with her sister and the development of the hero, Mark, feel underdeveloped. The humor in the portrayal of little kids is a bright spot, but the overall repetitiveness detracts from the story.",

            "The first half of the book felt confusing and aimless, mainly due to Emily’s incessant complaints and minimal plot progression. The romantic relationship between Emily and Mark only began to develop around the 38% to 40% mark, which seemed late for a slow-burn romance. While the pacing improved afterward, I still craved more time to witness their relationship evolve.",
            "Emily is a strong, independent woman who embraces her single life in her thirties without seeking pity. She values her independence over settling for a mediocre relationship and has built a decent life for herself. Her humor and candor about her family, career, and the publishing industry are engaging, even if her complaints take center stage in the first half of the book. The slow-burn romance between Emily and Mark is initially unclear due to their limited interactions. Emily's ongoing dates with other men further cast doubt on the development of their relationship. However, once their romance begins to blossom, it becomes satisfying, though I would have appreciated more scenes to deepen their connection."

        "conclusion": "Overall, the book had a strong start with Emily’s relatable and humorous character, but the plot felt directionless in the first half. The romance eventually picked up, though it could have benefited from more development. The inclusion of Mark’s POV in Part Two was a highlight and added much-needed depth to the story.",

            "The story began slowly, with repetitive details that hindered its momentum. The emphasis on the publishing world did little to advance the plot. However, the second half of the novel proved to be much more enjoyable and engaging.",

However, both Emily and Mark are depicted with authenticity, featuring well-developed flaws and dilemmas. Mark's character, in particular, proves to be more nuanced than anticipated; his unwavering support for Emily's career in the face of her family's criticisms is a standout aspect of the story.",
            "This novel offers a light yet engaging exploration of relatable everyday struggles and relationships. The author skillfully highlights the pressures of societal and familial expectations, especially regarding marriage and career."

            "I'm a big fan of well-crafted fake relationship stories, but they often risk falling into lazy plotting, with the primary conflict revolving around its artificiality. Unfortunately, that’s what occurred here, particularly in the final act.",

The true highlights of the story were the mother-daughter and sibling relationships, overshadowing the romance. I found myself wanting to confront Allison, and in hindsight, I’d be ready to take on Scarlett as well.",

They didn’t have a ton of chemistry.  \n  - There was very little spice, and what was there was very mild.  \n\n- **Humor and Quirks:**  \n  - Ms. Margaret Muffin’s Instagram captions were absolutely perfect—they never missed.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  - There was a little too much millennial angst for my taste.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a cute romcom with some enjoyable elements, like the Canadian setting and the exploration of family dynamics.

            "The pacing of the romance is exceptional, arguably the best I've encountered in a romance novel. It contrasts sharply with the typical insta-love trope, particularly from Emily's perspective. Her decision to go on other dates at the beginning enhances the authenticity of her journey.",
            "The main female lead, Emily, comes across as negative and judgmental, yet I found this aspect of her character humorous rather than off-putting. While some readers might view this trait as a flaw due to her lack of growth, I appreciated her consistent approach throughout the story.",
            "I appreciated that the book focuses primarily on Emily’s perspective, providing deep insight into her life challenges and her gradual feelings for Mark. While Mark’s limited POVs felt weaker, this understated approach effectively served the novel’s purpose.",

It’s perfect for readers who enjoy slice-of-life stories.  \n\n- **Trope Execution:**  \n  - This is the first time I’ve ever truly believed a fake dating trope. It was executed so well that it felt realistic and engaging.  \n\n- **Characterization (Main Female Lead):**  \n  - The main female lead, Emily, is very negative and judgmental, but I found it funny rather than off-putting. While some readers might see this as a flaw, she never changes, and I appreciated her consistency.  \n\n- **Pacing and Romance Development:**  \n  - The pacing of the romance is amazing, possibly the best I’ve seen in a romance novel. It’s the complete opposite of insta-love, especially from Emily’s side. She even goes on other dates at the beginning, which adds to the authenticity of her journey.  \n\n- **Point of View (POV):**  \n  - I loved that most of the book is heavily focused on Emily’s POV. It allowed me to deeply understand her life challenges and her gradual falling for Mark. Mark’s few POVs were weaker, but I believe that served the novel’s purpose well.  \n\n- **Themes of Family and Culture:**  \n  - The way family and culture were handled in this novel felt immersive and authentic. Some family members were delightful, while others were frustrating and annoying, which made it feel true to life. The resolution was incredibly satisfying.  \n\n- **Narration:**  \n  - I enjoyed the narrators and thought they added to the overall experience of the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a standout in the romance genre for me.

The cat's presence adds a delightful charm to the narrative.",

            "In the first half of the book, I found Emily quite irritating, though I can't quite pinpoint why—perhaps it was a personal reaction. She came across as whiny, but things took a turn when she finally admitted her feelings for Mark, the male lead. Her reluctance to acknowledge her affection, primarily because her mother liked him too, made her more relatable. I had rooted for Mark since their second meeting, so it was satisfying to see Emily eventually reach that point as well. Their chemistry is palpable, and the initial friendship they develop feels authentic. Emily's family dynamics add a vibrant, chaotic energy to the story, presenting both challenges and moments of heartfelt connection, particularly toward the end. A special mention goes to Ms. Margaret Muffins, who stands out as the best character in the book."

I can't really pinpoint why, honestly—it may have just been a me issue—but I found her so irritating and somewhat whiny. However, when she actually admitted she liked Mark (MMC), she became much better. She was so against liking him because her mother did, and it took her a long time to admit her feelings.  \n\n- **Character Development (MMC - Mark):**  \n  I loved Mark from the second meeting and knew Emily would get there too. Their chemistry is great (the spice is spicy), and the friendship they developed first felt very real.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n  Emily's family dynamics are a big hurdle in this book, and her whole family brings a wild energy into every scene they are in. They do get some closure and heart-to-hearts toward the end, which is really good.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters:**  \n  Special shoutout to Ms. Margaret Muffins for being the best character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a really fun book that I would recommend.

She immediately got under my skin. From the start, she came across as rude, condescending, and self-righteous. I found her to be extremely hateful for no apparent reason, which made it difficult for me to connect with or root for her.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes (Enemies to Lovers):**  \n  I usually enjoy the enemies-to-lovers trope, but in this case, it felt more like a bully situation. The dynamic between the characters was too much for me, especially with Emily's behavior.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Unfortunately, this book was not for me. I had to DNF (Did Not Finish) it at 10% because I couldn't tolerate Emily's personality or the writing style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the opportunity to read and review this advanced copy, *Love, Lies, and Cherry Pies* did not resonate with me. The combination of an unlikable protagonist, excessive info-dumping, and an unbalanced enemies-to-lovers dynamic made it impossible for me to continue.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️: 2 of 5"

            "Emily serves as the primary protagonist, with the narrative predominantly reflecting her perspective. The nuanced and tender relationship between Emily and her mother offers a refreshing portrayal of the mother-daughter dynamic. The tension and eventual reconciliation between Emily and her sister, Allison, are skillfully depicted, adding depth to the family dynamics. However, Mark, the love interest, feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; his character is largely defined by his cat, Miss Muffins, rather than his own traits. The chemistry between Emily and Mark is minimal, making their relationship feel more like a checklist of qualities than a genuine emotional connection. Ultimately, the romantic aspect feels secondary, as Emily primarily focuses on her family and career, leaving little space for romance to truly flourish.",

Being born and raised there, it always brings comfort and familiarity to my heart when books are set in my hometown.  \n\n- **Relatability of Characters and Themes:**  \n  I found Emily's feelings, especially regarding her relationship with her mom, very relatable. Like Emily, I’ve often felt that my parents expected big things from me and that I’ve let them down. However, Mark’s reassurance to Emily that her parents are proud of her resonated deeply with me.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I loved how much Mark cared for and supported Emily by the end of the book. Isn’t that the kind of partner we all want? His growth and dedication to her were heartwarming.  \n\n- **Humor and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book had me smiling and laughing throughout. For instance, \"Project Pen\" was such a sweet and funny way for a mom to do something special for her child. It added a delightful touch to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a wonderful read that combined humor, emotional depth, and relatable themes. The setting, character dynamics, and heartfelt moments made it an enjoyable and comforting experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

            "I found Emily's complaints about aging at 32 to be exaggerated and somewhat irritating. As someone approaching 46, I perceived her perspective on aging as overly dramatic and unrealistic. Additionally, the sudden change in Emily's mom after their significant conversation felt abrupt and inconsistent. For much of the book, she was overly pushy, obsessively discussing Mark and spying on their dates, only to later acknowledge her behavior and express pride in Emily without sufficient depth in this transition. However, the interactions between Emily and Mark were heartwarming; their cooking for each other and Mark's involvement with Emily's nieces added a charming layer to their relationship.",

            "The story opens with Emily's perspective, but midway through, we shift to Mark's point of view, with the narrative alternating between them thereafter. While Mark’s perspective adds depth, it feels somewhat jarring to introduce it later in the story. The revelation toward the end enhances the plot, bringing an intriguing twist. Initially, Emily is frustrated by her mother's pressure to date Mark Chan, prompting her to fake a relationship to gain her mother's approval. As expected, she discovers there's more to Mark than she first realized. However, the last chapter and epilogue felt overly sentimental, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story."

The premise of being the only single sister among four married siblings added to the predictability.  \n\n- **Relatability and Humor:**  \n  It’s a funny read, and I’m sure a lot of people can relate to the mom’s character. The dynamics between the family members, especially the meddling ones, were entertaining and relatable.  \n\n- **Character Development (Emily):**  \n  Emily, the protagonist, holds her own against her mom and other meddling family members. She stays true to herself and her goals, which made her a strong and likable character.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was enjoyable and humorous, its predictability and familiar tropes made it less surprising. However, the relatable family dynamics and Emily’s strong character made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Mark, the charmingly grumpy MMC, would have benefited from an earlier introduction to the dual POV, allowing us deeper insight into his thoughts.",

Her constant meddling in her 33-year-old daughter's life, career, and love life was infuriating. While she eventually redeemed herself, the damage she caused made it hard to like her.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Sister Relationship):**  \n  The sister was even worse than the mother, adding another layer of tension and frustration to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Mark and Emily):**  \n  Mark and Emily's relationship was intriguing but lacked chemistry. They seemed to dislike each other for most of the story, and even when they started to develop feelings, it still felt like they harbored resentment. Mark came across as particularly dull, and there was no real spark between them.  \n\n- **Spice Level:**  \n  The romantic elements of the story were underwhelming, with a spice level of 2 out of 10.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some interesting dynamics, particularly between the mother and daughter, the frustrating characters and lack of romantic chemistry made it a challenging read. The mother's eventual redemption wasn't enough to fully salvage her character, and Mark and Emily's relationship felt flat.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 2/10  \n- Overall: 3.5/10"

            "The first half of the book was a challenge for me as I found Emily's constant judgment of Mark exhausting. Although the second half was an improvement, the initial setup left a lingering negative impression. The pacing felt uneven, with an excessive emphasis on misunderstandings and conflict early on.",
            "I found Emily, the main character, to be excessively judgmental and unkind to Mark, the male lead. Her relentless negativity and refusal to recognize any redeeming qualities in him made it challenging to believe in their romance. While her initial reluctance to date him due to her mother’s interference was understandable, her ongoing harshness in the first half of the book felt extreme and unrelatable. The lack of believable chemistry between Emily and Mark was a significant issue; it was hard to comprehend why Mark would be interested in someone so critical of him. This disconnect made it difficult for me to invest in their relationship, despite a slight improvement in the second half of the book.",
            "This book may attract readers who appreciate themes such as unlikable female protagonists, millennial angst, overbearing family dynamics, and romantic misunderstandings.

Emily's hesitance to confront her mother and her choice to maintain the ruse were at times frustrating.

I was initially taken aback by the shift in focus and the introduction of Mark's perspective in the second half, but I came to appreciate this transition.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the fake dating trope, filled with banter and slow-burn tension, while the second part delves deeper into Emily and Mark's relationship and explores Emily's dynamic with her Asian-Canadian family. Initially, I was surprised by the shift in focus and the introduction of Mark's point of view in the second half, but I quickly grew to appreciate it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Emily's character is well-developed, with her career as a novelist playing a significant role in her identity. Her struggles with insecurity, financial instability, and her perception of the publishing industry's unfairness add depth to her character. However, her resentment toward people with more stable, well-paying careers felt unjustified and somewhat immature. The second half of the novel shows growth in her relationships with her family and her career, though I wish she had shown more respect for others' life choices.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is addictive, with a sweet and funny tone that makes the story engaging. The attention to character and detail, along with the Bridget Jones callbacks, added to my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Humor:**  \n  The novel balances humor with deeper themes, such as family dynamics, career struggles, and personal growth. Emily's financial struggles and her barista job provide recurring comedic moments, though her resentment toward others' success occasionally detracted from the humor.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  While the first half is lighthearted and focused on the fake dating trope, the second half shifts to a more introspective exploration of relationships and family. This change in focus was initially jarring but ultimately rewarding.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sweet and funny rom-com offers a delightful mix of humor, character development, and heartfelt moments. While Emily's occasional resentment toward others' success felt immature, her growth in both her career and family relationships was satisfying. The novel's addictive prose and attention to detail make it a highly enjoyable read, though it could have been even better with less focus on Emily's complaints about others' financial success.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars. Would have been 5 stars if Emily had spent less time complaining about other people earning more money and/or less time avoiding work via the internet.  \n\n[I received a complimentary ARC from NetGalley and the publisher. Opinions are my own.]"

            "The ending was satisfying and wrapped up the story nicely. Despite some flaws, I found the book to be charming and enjoyable overall. It has a delightful Bridget Jones/Pride & Prejudice vibe that I truly appreciated. The fake dating trope was well-executed, although the story began a bit slowly. The slow-burn romance may not appeal to everyone, as it was indeed quite gradual. I liked the introduction of dual POV halfway through, though having it earlier would have enhanced the experience. While the pacing started slow, it picked up significantly as the narrative unfolded.",
            "In the first half of the book, the protagonist, Emily, often comes across as negative and difficult to relate to. In contrast, Mark, the male lead, is charming, and it would have been beneficial to hear his perspective sooner. The portrayal of family dynamics, particularly Emily's overbearing mother and her frustrations with Emily being single in her 30s, felt both frustrating and authentic.",
            "The book features numerous laugh-out-loud moments and adorable scenes, including instances of drunk texting and the delightful character of Ms. Muffins.",
            "The Toronto setting was beautifully depicted, enhancing the story's charm. The vivid food descriptions were tantalizing and left me feeling hungry!",
            "This story vividly explores themes of family drama, miscommunication, and the magnetic pull of opposites attracting."

        "conclusion": "*Love, Lies & Cherry Pie* is a charming, slow-burn romance with a mix of humor, family drama, and relatable struggles. While the pacing was slow at the start and Emily’s negativity made her hard to connect with initially, the character development, Mark’s perspective, and the overall story made it a delightful read. The book’s themes of fake dating, opposites attract, and family dynamics were well-executed, and the ending left me satisfied.",

            "Emily is a relatable protagonist for those who appreciate early drinks and quiet nights at home with a white noise machine and humidifier. Her stream-of-consciousness style provides a clear insight into her thoughts and emotions, which is refreshing for readers who prefer straightforward characters. However, her habit of cutting off Mark during conversations early on felt a bit know-it-all, which I found cringe-worthy and detrimental to their relationship development. While their connection held potential, Emily's interruptions and dismissive attitude hindered its natural progression. I admired Mark's patience, but I would have liked to see more meaningful interactions between them to strengthen the foundation of their relationship.",
            "This book provides insightful commentary on the challenges of navigating life in your 30s, from juggling multiple jobs to managing family expectations and understanding what a genuine relationship entails. Emily's experiences as a millennial woman are depicted with both humor and honesty, making for an engaging read.",
            "As a daughter of an immigrant and a first-generation American, I found the author's depiction of the older sister's experience and familial pressures deeply relatable. Emily's character resonated with me, particularly her challenges in juggling multiple roles—writer, barista, tutor, sister, daughter, roommate, friend, and both a fake and a real girlfriend. Her traits, such as millennial ADHD, dependence on animal videos for escapism, and the overstimulation from a large, intrusive family, felt genuine and reflective of many women in their 30s."
