It wasn't an enjoyable read; rather, it evoked a sense of discomfort for the woman, the man, and his loved ones as their private lives were laid bare. It felt intrusive, akin to overhearing deeply personal gossip from a neighbor with no sense of boundaries.",

While the premise had potential, the execution felt exploitative and voyeuristic, with an unnecessary and offensive tangent that detracted from the story. The emotional weight of the narrative was overwhelming, but not in a way that felt meaningful or cathartic. Ultimately, it didn’t deliver on the promise of its intriguing title.",

In contrast, the second half loses focus, presenting a series of disjointed vignettes that lack the depth and cohesion of the earlier chapters.",

After the prologue, which I found laugh-out-loud funny, I expected a rollercoaster ride of emotions and revelations about a dead husband who was a lying, cheating, lecherous, mentally-deranged, good-for-nothing bastard. However, the story did not unfold as I anticipated.  \n\n- **Story Execution and Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n   - The book fell short of my expectations, especially compared to other works with similar premises. I had just finished reading *From Scratch* by Tembi Locke, which also deals with a young widow mourning her husband but was executed differently and more effectively. Additionally, Joan Didion's *The Year of Magical Thinking* is incomparable in this genre, further highlighting this book's shortcomings.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook Experience):**  \n   - The narrator, Cassandra Campbell, did not suit the book. While I’ve enjoyed her narration in other works, this book is distinctly Canadian, referencing Canadian people, places, and things. A Canadian narrator would have been more appropriate, as the subtle differences in accent and pronunciation were noticeable and distracting for a Canadian listener. Given that the book is by a Canadian author, it’s likely that much of its audience will be Canadian, making this an important consideration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was okay but did not meet my expectations.

It feels disconnected and adds confusion rather than closure.  \n\n- **Themes and Relevance:**  \n   - The memoir touches on themes of redefining one's understanding of late loved ones after posthumous revelations, which resonates with readers grappling with similar experiences.  \n\n- **Comparative Context:**  \n   - The reader mentions other books (*The Less People Know About Us*, *Inheritance*, and *Unearthing*) as further reading for those interested in similar themes of family secrets, identity, and betrayal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the memoir starts strong with a poignant and nuanced first half, it loses its way in the second half, becoming disjointed and meandering. The afterward further complicates the reader's understanding of the book's purpose, leaving a sense of confusion. Despite these flaws, the themes of redefining relationships with late loved ones after posthumous revelations are compelling and relatable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No explicit rating scores are provided in the review.  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The reader has completed 273 books in 2024 and 1876 books cumulatively, indicating a well-read perspective."

While grief is a central theme, the lack of rage or stronger emotional confrontation with the deceased spouse was disappointing. The title suggests a more intense emotional response, but the protagonist's prolonged wallowing in therapy and mental preoccupation with her husband felt excessive.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist's emotional journey was underwhelming. Except for one moment of confrontation with her husband's mistress, there was a noticeable absence of anger or deeper emotional complexity toward her deceased spouse. This made her character feel one-dimensional and overly passive.  \n\n- **Practicality as a Guide:**  \n  As a potential guide for other widows, the novel falls short. The protagonist's prolonged focus on her husband and her inability to move forward emotionally makes it an unsuitable recommendation for those seeking guidance or inspiration in similar situations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had some moments of interest, its overwhelming focus on grief and the protagonist's lack of emotional depth made it a disappointing read.

However, the book primarily focuses on grief and the author’s journey through mourning and acceptance.\n\n- **Exploration of Relationships and Mental Health:**\n   - The book touches on the husband’s mental health issues and erratic behavior before his death but doesn’t deeply explore these aspects. I didn’t get a strong sense of what their relationship was like, how it deteriorated, or why the author ignored the red flags of his declining mental health.\n\n- **Focus on Grief and Coping:**\n   - The memoir centers on the author’s spiraling behavior after her husband’s death and how she coped (or failed to cope) with her grief. This is the core theme of the book.\n\n- **Narrative Style:**\n   - The memoir reads like a novel, written in the present tense, which creates a sense of immediacy as if the events are unfolding in real time. The author includes a lot of reconstructed dialogue, which felt odd to me since it couldn’t be verbatim, but I recognize it’s her story to tell.\n\n- **Spiritual and Mystical Elements:**\n   - The second half of the book takes a mystical turn, delving into spiritualism. This might not appeal to readers who aren’t interested in such themes.\n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**\n   - Cassandra Campbell’s narration is excellent, and she convincingly brings the author’s story to life. I felt as though it was her own story being told.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis memoir is more about the author’s journey through grief and acceptance than the shocking secrets and scandals suggested by the title and synopsis. While it doesn’t deeply explore the relationship dynamics or mental health issues, it offers a raw and immediate portrayal of loss and coping.

If you don’t fully grasp the nature of the condition before reading, you’ll likely have a solid understanding by the end.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The most heartbreaking moment comes from the protagonist’s young son, who reflects on his father’s behavior. His innocent yet profound observation about his father’s inability to appreciate happy family moments, like their time at the dog park, is deeply moving. This scene highlights the emotional toll of bipolar disorder on family members, especially children.  \n\n- **Pacing and Narrative Strength:**  \n   - The first two-thirds of the book are powerful and engaging. However, the final third loses some of its impact, becoming flaky and at times eye-roll-inducing.  \n\n- **Epilogue and Additional Sections:**  \n   - The Epilogue and the sections that follow it detract significantly from the overall reading experience. These parts feel unnecessary and would have been better omitted.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - The reviewer expresses gratitude to the publisher and Edelweiss for providing an early digital review copy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a poignant and educational exploration of bipolar disorder, with moments of profound emotional depth, particularly through the perspective of the protagonist’s young son.

I really thought this would be a good one and was genuinely hooked at the beginning.  \n\n- **Plot Development and Direction:**  \n   - As the story developed, I felt like there was no direction whatsoever. The hook used in the beginning seemed like a tactic to grab the reader, but everything else felt like a bunch of nothing.  \n   - The infidelity, which was presented as a major theme early on, ended up being a small topic rather than the central focus I expected.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Exploration:**  \n   - I don’t think the book explored much of the emotional turmoil or the complex emotions that come from such a situation. While I acknowledge the author’s experience is valid, I didn’t feel it was deeply examined or impactful.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n   - The second half was truly painful to read.

This structure provides insight into why she fell in love with him and why she struggles to reconcile the man she knew with the secrets he kept. The first half focuses on the shock and anger of uncovering Sean’s hidden life, while the second half is about her path toward forgiveness and healing.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Jessica Waite’s journey is deeply personal and relatable.

However, recognizing that this is a true story rooted in her memories, I refrained from judging her perspective on grief. Sean is depicted as a good person, boss, father, and, in many ways, a decent husband. Yet, he grapples with personal demons, including porn addiction, possible sex addiction, and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. These struggles were likely concealed from his wife, as he may have thought he could resolve them without causing her pain.",

I didn’t realize it was a memoir until I was 46% through the book. This narrative style made the story engaging and immersive.\n\n- **Characterization and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The portrayal of Sean, the deceased husband, was complex and nuanced. Initially, I felt sorry for him and thought the main character (the author) wasn’t being fair to him.

Sean was depicted as a good person, boss, father, and, in some ways, a good husband, though he struggled with personal demons like porn addiction, possible sex addiction, and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. His struggles were likely hidden from his wife, as he probably thought he could fix things without causing her pain.\n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book explores themes of grief, loss, and the complexities of marriage.

The first part captures the profound shock and grief of a 44-year-old widow grappling with the sudden death of her 47-year-old spouse, leaving her to raise their nine-year-old child alone. Her initial sorrow quickly transforms into anger as she uncovers his secret life, which includes a stash of pornography, significant credit card debt, and expenses related to escort services, gambling, and marijuana.

As a memoir, I expected a clear, cohesive sequence of events, but the narrative felt confusing. The majority of events occurred after the funeral, with backstories interspersed, but the distribution of these life events lacked cohesion.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The author, Jessica Waite, delves into heavy topics like her husband’s porn addiction, hidden debt, illicit affairs, and mental health struggles. However, the discussion of these topics felt scattered and disjointed, making the narrative feel all over the place.  \n\n- **Strengths (Emotional Depth and Relationships):**  \n  Despite the structural issues, I appreciated the way Jessica Waite explored life after her husband’s death and how her relationship with her son, Dash, evolved. This aspect of the memoir was emotionally resonant and well-executed.  \n\n- **Closure and Resolution:**  \n  The memoir lacked a satisfying sense of closure. While the revelations were intriguing, there was no clear “then, what” or resolution to the unraveled secrets, which left me wanting more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a promising memoir with a strong title and an emotionally compelling exploration of life after loss. However, the scattered structure and lack of cohesive closure detracted from its overall impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

It felt self-indulgent, as if the focus was on expressing the character's experiences rather than creating a meaningful connection with the audience.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  The pacing was slow, and I struggled to get through the book. It took me much longer to read than usual because I wasn't engaged. The story felt like looking at someone else's family photo album—nice for a few minutes but not compelling enough to hold my interest.  \n\n- **Attention to Detail:**  \n  The excessive focus on trivial details, like the brand of jacket a character wore, felt unnecessary and added little value to the story. It detracted from the overall experience rather than enhancing it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book failed to engage me. The main character lacked depth, the narrative felt self-indulgent, and the pacing was slow. While there was nothing inherently wrong with the story, it didn't resonate with me or hold my interest.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this poignant narrative, the author faces the sudden death of her husband at 47 during a business trip. In the aftermath, she uncovers shocking secrets: an affair, encounters with escorts, recreational drug use, and a pornography addiction. While the book jacket claims these revelations undermine her entire understanding of her husband, it becomes clear that undiagnosed mental health issues significantly influenced his choices and behaviors. The story ultimately explores the complexities hidden beneath the surface of their marriage.",

I was expecting a lot more anger from the widow and many, many awful things from the dead husband.  \n\n- **Characterization of the Husband:**  \n  Jessica Waite’s husband dies suddenly on a business trip at the age of 47. After his death, Jessica learns of an affair, escorts during business trips, drug use (weed), and a porn addiction. The book jacket states that these shocking secrets undermine everything she thought she knew about her husband. However, as the book unfolds, the reader learns that undiagnosed mental health issues most likely played a large part in the decisions and actions of her deceased husband.  \n\n- **Themes and Focus:**  \n  Most of the book is actually about Jessica’s journey with grief and reconciling her feelings toward a man she loved.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Worth the read if you happen to find it on your library shelf.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the title and initial expectations didn’t fully align with the story, the book offers a compelling exploration of grief, forgiveness, and the complexities of a flawed marriage.

The first half was intriguing and connected well to the title, drawing me in and keeping me engaged.  \n\n- **Pacing and Coherence:**  \n  The second half became harder to follow. Instead of tying up loose ends, it left me with many questions, which made the narrative feel disjointed and less satisfying.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  Despite the confusion in the second half, the ending was somewhat satisfying, providing a sense of closure, though not entirely resolving all the lingering questions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book began with great potential and an engaging first half, the second half struggled with pacing and coherence, leaving several unresolved questions. However, the ending offered a degree of satisfaction, making it a mixed but not entirely disappointing read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She delves into the disturbing secrets he kept, which left her justifiably angry, bitter, and hurt.\n   - There’s a sense that she grew to understand his mental illnesses (OCD and addictions) and may have even forgiven him, reflecting on why she loved him in the first place.\n\n- **Purpose and Catharsis:**\n   - The book seems to serve as a venting and processing tool for Jessica, and writing it must have been cathartic for her. However, I was left unsure of the book’s overall purpose or message.\n\n- **Ethical Concerns and Impact on Others:**\n   - I wonder who Jessica may have hurt by publishing such detailed accounts of Sean’s transgressions. Specifically, how will their son, Dash, feel when he’s older? Does he really need to know all these details, and will friends judge him for his father’s behavior?\n   - I also dislike how Jessica publicly shamed Rebecca, who may have been another victim of Sean’s manipulative behavior. It feels unfair to blame Rebecca more than Sean, who, by the end of the book, appears to be largely forgiven.\n   - I question whether Jessica’s sister-in-law, Julie, was hurt by the mention of her offhand comment, “you really got right in there?” Additionally, how is Sean’s family coping with the book’s revelations?\n\n- **Content and Style:**\n   - The inclusion of “woo woo” treatments and visits to psychics felt excessive and detracted from the overall narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the book offers a raw and emotional exploration of Jessica’s relationship with Sean and her journey toward understanding and forgiveness, it raises ethical concerns about the impact on others, particularly their son and those mentioned in the book.
