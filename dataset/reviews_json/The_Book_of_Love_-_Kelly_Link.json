I dreaded picking it up and could only manage by alternating chapters with other books I wasn’t enjoying. The ebook format with a tiny font made it feel even longer, as each page equated to four normal-sized pages, and the slow page-turning added to the frustration.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first third of the book was a slog, but my feelings completely shifted afterward. Despite reading other enjoyable books or engaging in other activities, I found myself consistently wanting to return to this story.  \n\n- **Uniqueness and Creativity:**  \n  The book is truly one of a kind. It features three kids who die and come back, a death-like figurehead, a magical music teacher, a cursed splinter, a moon woman, a haunting carousel, and even a child named Carousel. The setting is an unforgettable, unrealistic town, and the story includes a series of weird, annoying romances.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The twists, laughs, and tragedies in the book made me feel something deeply, which is significant given my usual emotional detachment.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Once I pushed past the initial challenges, I had a really good time with the book. It became an engaging and memorable experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the initial struggle with the book’s length and pacing, it ultimately won me over with its unique, emotional, and creative storytelling. My unpopular opinion is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5  \n\n**Additional Context:**  \n(Thanks to the publisher for the e-arc.)  \n*Me at a horror movie: :)*  \n*Me at a haunted house: :)*  \n*Me at a long book: AHHHHHHHHHH*"

However, the narrative felt disjointed, akin to watching an engaging fight scene interrupted by constant commercial breaks. The plot suffered due to the excessive focus on character backstories, which detracted from the main storyline.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book introduced over 30 characters, each with their own backstory, leading to a lack of focus. The constant shifting between characters felt like playing \"character whack-a-mole,\" which diluted the impact of the plot. Certain characters, such as Thomas/Kristopher/Avelot, would have been better suited for a prequel, while Mo’s mom and grandmother deserved their own short story.\n\n- **Repetition:**  \n  The narrative relied heavily on repetition, particularly with reveals. A reveal would occur, only to be repeated later by an off-screen character joining the group. This redundancy disrupted the flow and suspense of the story.\n\n- **Title and Cover Design:**  \n  The title, *The Book of Love*, and the cover featuring moons were puzzling. The title did not seem to align with the story’s content, and the moon motif was only briefly and haphazardly referenced at the end, making it feel insignificant.\n\n- **Concept and Execution:**  \n  The concept was imaginative and had great potential, but the execution fell short. The excessive character-building overshadowed the plot, significantly interfering with the suspense and overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book’s concept was imaginative and intriguing, its execution was hindered by an overabundance of characters, repetitive storytelling, and a lack of focus on the main plot.

Although there is an initial explanation for some characters' magical abilities, this concept is largely neglected by the end. Additionally, the magic is often employed for trivial purposes, such as persuading parents to extend curfews or deceiving salespeople into giving away items.",

Although the premise and writing are technically strong, the narrative lacks the darker, more complex themes often associated with adult fantasy. The teenage characters are portrayed authentically, but the story misses the opportunity to explore deeper, more mature themes."

It lacked the large message expected of a 600-page adult fantasy book.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Genre:**  \n  The book is branded as adult fantasy but feels more like a young adult (YA) novel. The characters are 17-18 years old, and much of the story revolves around their interpersonal teenage problems.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Some of the teenage characters were more interesting than others. They all had a solid mix of love/relationship problems and larger family issues. The story is told from the perspectives of at least 6 or 7 teenagers.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the book felt underdeveloped. Characters morph into animals like bears, seagulls, and tigers without much rhyme or reason. While there was an initial explanation for why certain characters could use magic, this was largely abandoned by the end. The magic was often used for trivial purposes, such as convincing parents to extend curfew or tricking salespeople into giving away items.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The story is set over the course of days but spans 600 pages, making it feel overly long. A tighter execution would have improved the experience.  \n\n- **Tone and Expectations:**  \n  The book lacked the darker or more sinister tone expected of an adult fantasy novel. The teenage characters behaved authentically, but the story didn’t delve into the deeper, more mature themes one might anticipate.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and technical writing were strong, the book fell short in delivering a meaningful message or aligning with its marketed genre.

The plot is often overshadowed by social commentary and observations about the absurdity of the situations the characters find themselves in.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  There is a lot of talk about magic, but not much actual magic happening.

One character even transforms into multiple versions of the same dull persona, adding no excitement to the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The author’s writing is dry, lifeless, and uninspired. Even extraordinary events are described with the same flat tone as mundane activities, making the narrative feel monotonous and unengaging.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The story is repetitive, with each chapter retelling the same plot from different characters’ perspectives without adding new insights or depth. The timeline is disjointed and confusing, jumping around without purpose, which makes it difficult to follow.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The novel is slow-paced, with a promising start that quickly loses momentum due to uninteresting characters and a lack of emotional investment. The excessive length and drawn-out ending feel unnecessary and tedious.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement:**  \n  The author fails to evoke any meaningful emotion from the reader. Even significant events, such as the death of important characters, are portrayed with as much impact as dropping a piece of toast.  \n\n- **Originality and Themes:**  \n  The book attempts to capitalize on the popularity of vampire novels but lacks the passion, excitement, and depth typically associated with the genre. It feels like a shallow imitation rather than a fresh or innovative take.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Book of Love* is a tedious and uninspired novel that fails to deliver on multiple fronts. With its lifeless characters, repetitive plot, disjointed timeline, and lack of emotional engagement, the book feels like a slog to read. Despite its promising beginning, it ultimately falls flat, leaving the reader unsatisfied and unfulfilled.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nThe review does not explicitly mention numerical rating scores, but the overall sentiment is highly critical, suggesting a very low rating."

They break so many rules of plotting and arcs, and yet they're fascinating all the way to the last drop.

But none of the stories the kids engage in as they try to resume their lives are what you'd expect. It is a decisively lo-fi novel of the impossible, filled with insecurity and the small details of life, rather than constant explosive stakes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Because those kids are going to have their own drama and trauma from suddenly existing again, and giving them powers doesn't mean they'll spin around ready to form Voltron and attack God.

I bought it the day of release but took a few months to actually start reading it. I’d seen it described as slow, but I’d characterize it as leisurely.\n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The book opens with an intriguing premise: four teenagers come back from the dead, not knowing how they died or why they were brought back 11 months later. They must solve a magical problem if they want to keep living. However, the book is less a mystery and more a close examination of the teens’ lives in a small New England town in December.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The teens include Danial, the oldest of many step-siblings, who rejects his new magical powers and just wants to live a small, ordinary life. There’s Mo, who lost his parents young and was raised by his grandmother, a famous Black romance novelist—who herself died during the 11 months he spent in the underworld. Laura is a musically ambitious teen who returns to her single mom and sister Susannah, who seems entangled with the magical ritual that killed and might save her friends. The fourth person, unknown to the others, snuck out of death on their coattails and has no name and few memories.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book rotates POVs every chapter, featuring more than 15 different perspectives, some of whom appear only once in the entire volume. I love Link’s writing style, so this worked for me, but I can see how the choice to linger over details not directly related to the plot might not appeal to some readers.\n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book, but it took me three weeks to read it.

However, the constant shifts between characters and backstories disrupted the flow, making it feel like watching a fight scene interrupted by commercials. This significantly interfered with the suspense and momentum of the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book introduces over 30 characters, each with their own backstory, which overwhelmed the narrative. Instead of deepening the plot, the excessive focus on characters felt like \"character whack-a-mole.\" Certain characters, such as Thomas/Kristopher/Avelot, would have been better suited for a prequel, while Mo’s mom and grandmother deserved their own short story.\n\n- **Repetition:**  \n  The book suffers from unnecessary repetition. For instance, a reveal would occur, only to be repeated later when an off-screen character rejoined the group. This redundancy detracted from the storytelling and made the narrative feel disjointed.\n\n- **Title and Cover:**  \n  The title, *The Book of Love*, and the cover, featuring moons, were puzzling. The title didn’t seem to align with the story’s content, and the moon motif was only briefly and haphazardly mentioned at the end, making it feel irrelevant.\n\n- **Concept and Imagination:**  \n  The core concept of the book is imaginative and fascinating, akin to an engaging fight scene. However, the execution fell short due to the excessive focus on character backstories and repetitive elements, which diluted the overall impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Book of Love* boasts a creative and imaginative premise, its execution is hindered by an overabundance of characters, repetitive storytelling, and a lack of alignment between the title/cover and the narrative.

Which, in fact, they are.  \n  With them in the room is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance—and what has brought them back again. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to the terms of the bargain their music teacher proposes. They will be given a series of magical tasks; while they undertake them, they may return to their families and friends, but they can tell no one where they’ve been. In the end, there will be winners and there will be losers.  \n  But their resurrection has attracted the notice of other supernatural figures, all with their own agendas. As Laura, Daniel, and Mo grapple with the pieces of the lives they left behind, and Laura’s sister, Susannah, attempts to reconcile what she remembers with what she fears, these mysterious others begin to arrive, engulfing their community in danger and chaos, and it becomes imperative that the teens solve the mystery of their deaths to avert a looming disaster.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and atmospheric, almost like a fairy tale.\n\n- **Creativity and World-Building:**  \n  I liked some of the names: the band name is My Two Hands Both Knowe You; the coffee shop is What Hast Thou Ground?; and one of the magical characters is called Carousel.

The story is told from the perspectives of at least 6 or 7 teenagers.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the book felt underdeveloped. Characters morph into animals like bears, seagulls, and tigers without much rhyme or reason. While there was an initial explanation for why certain characters could use magic, this was largely abandoned by the end. The magic was often used for trivial purposes, such as convincing parents to extend curfew or tricking salespeople into giving away items.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The story is set over the course of days but spans 600 pages, making it feel overly long.

The plot is rich with symbolism, riddles, and philosophical questions, creating a layered and immersive narrative.\n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters are deeply nuanced, with each having a \"book\" of their lives, reminiscent of biblical and apocryphal texts.

For example, the number four represents stability and transition, while moths symbolize transformation or transmogrification. The town’s name, Lovesend, is a play on words that reflects the story’s central themes.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Kelly Link’s writing is described as musical, anthropomorphic, and filled with clues and riddles.

            "The book suffers from a lack of focus, as characters frequently act and speak in ways that feel disconnected from their previous thoughts and actions. Pseudo-explanations for post-magical scenarios seem tacked on rather than integrated. While there is extensive discussion about magic, actual magical events are scarce. The plot often takes a backseat to social commentary and observations on the absurdity of the characters' situations.",
            "The characters are strikingly quirky, embodying a blend of awkward teenage moments and a mix of childish adults and adult-like children. Their actions often lack tenderness or rationale, especially in scenes depicting casual sex, which come across as rough and spontaneous, with little regard for gender dynamics. The narrative blurs the lines between reality and imagination, leaving readers questioning who is real and who possesses magical abilities. While the adults struggle to act their age, the ancient immortals surprisingly engage with modern slang, despite their origins in the 1600s.",
            "The prose is whimsical and often hilarious, marked by its unique idiosyncrasies and a playful tone. The author skillfully infuses the mundane with a hint of menace while maintaining a relaxed atmosphere. However, there are significant exposition dumps, especially when delving into the backstory of ancient immortals.",
            "The magic system lacks clear rules and constraints, leaving characters aware of its existence but largely unengaged with it. Instead of meaningful exploration, magic is used for trivial tasks, such as cleaning stains from bedsheets. While sinister villains can transform people into animals, these changes are swiftly reversed with little explanation or consequence.",
            "The story offers rich social commentary, though it sometimes detracts from the plot. While objects and situations serve as symbols, their meanings can be ambiguous. The narrative delves into the fluidity of physical forms and the characters' evolving sexualities, all set against a backdrop of their unusual jadedness."

        "conclusion": "Despite its unfocused plot, lack of a coherent magic system, and confusing character dynamics, the book remains clever and entertaining.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  - The book feels brutally unfocused, with characters thinking, saying, and doing things that seem unrelated to their previous actions or thoughts.  \n  - There are pseudo-explanations for post-magical situations that appear to be added after the fact.  \n  - A lot of talk about magic occurs, but very little magic actually happens.  \n  - The plot is often sacrificed for social commentary and observations about the absurdity of the situations the characters find themselves in.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - Characters are quirky to an extreme degree, with awkward teen moments and a mix of uncomfortably adult children and childish adults.  \n  - Their actions often lack tenderness or reason, particularly in scenes involving casual sex, which are rough and spontaneous, with little attention paid to gender.  \n  - There is confusion about who is imaginary, who is real, and who can use magic.  \n  - Adults in the story are portrayed as unable to \"adult,\" while ancient immortals are oddly modern and in touch with current slang, despite their supposed origins in the 1600s.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  - There are no clear rules or constraints for the magic system.  \n  - Characters are aware of the magic but don’t explore or use it meaningfully, except for trivial tasks like cleaning stains off bedsheets.  \n  - Sinister villains can turn people into animals, but these transformations are quickly reversed without much fuss or explanation.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The prose is fluffy, hilarious in places, and incredibly idiosyncratic, with a nonsensical yet fun tone.  \n  - Kelly Link infuses the mundane with an ounce of menace and an easygoing atmosphere.  \n  - There are major exposition dumps, particularly when implanting backstory for ancient immortals.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  - The story includes a lot of social commentary, often at the expense of the plot.  \n  - Objects and situations are presented as symbols, but their significance is not always clear.  \n  - The fluidity of physical forms and the flowing nature of the characters' sexuality are explored, alongside their preternatural jadedness.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its unfocused plot, lack of a coherent magic system, and confusing character dynamics, the book remains clever and entertaining. Kelly Link’s unique writing style, infused with humor and menace, makes it an idiosyncratic and fun read, even if it often feels nonsensical and aimless.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It is a triumph that kept me fascinated all the way to the last drop.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Craft:**  \n  I’ve loved Kelly Link’s short fiction for years, but I could never pinpoint how her stories worked. They break so many rules of plotting and arcs, yet they remain compelling. *The Book of Love* continues this trend, presenting a decisively lo-fi novel of the impossible, filled with insecurity and the small details of life rather than constant explosive stakes.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel has an obvious hook: a group of kids is brought back from the dead for a conflict between two ominous figures engaged in a mysterious struggle. However, none of the stories the kids engage in as they try to resume their lives are what you’d expect. Every side-story they get sucked into was something I was hungry to see more of, even with doom dangling over their heads.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The book is deeply dedicated to the internal lives of people in impossible circumstances. The kids’ drama and trauma from suddenly existing again are central to the story. Giving them powers doesn’t mean they’ll spin around ready to form Voltron and attack God; instead, their struggles feel authentic and grounded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Book of Love* is a triumph of speculative fiction, blending an unconventional premise with rich character development and Kelly Link’s signature style. It captivated me with its focus on the internal lives of its characters and its refusal to follow predictable plotlines.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I bought it the day of release but took a few months to actually start reading it.  \n\n- **Pacing and Style:**  \n  I’d seen the book described as slow, but I’d characterize it as leisurely. Kelly Link’s writing style is something I love, and the book’s choice to linger over details not directly related to the plot worked for me. However, I can see how this might not appeal to all readers.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel opens with an intriguing premise: four teenagers come back from the dead, not knowing how they died or why they were brought back 11 months later. They must solve a magical problem if they want to keep living. However, the book is less of a mystery and more of a close examination of the teens’ lives in a small New England town in December.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The teens include Danial, the oldest of many step-siblings, who rejects his new magical powers and just wants to live a small, ordinary life. Mo, who lost his parents young, was raised by his grandmother, a famous Black romance novelist, who died during the 11 months he spent in the underworld. Laura, a musically ambitious teen, returns to her single mom and sister Susannah, who seems entangled with the magical ritual that killed and might save her friends. There’s also a fourth person, unknown to the others, who snuck out of death on their coattails and has no name and few memories.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book rotates POVs every chapter, featuring more than 15 different perspectives, some of whom only appear once in the entire volume.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book, but it took me three weeks to read.

I dreaded picking it up and could only manage by alternating chapters with other books I wasn’t enjoying. The ebook format with a tiny font made it feel like reading 2,548 pages instead of 637, and the slow page-turning added to the frustration.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first third of the book felt like a brain-murdering task, but my feelings completely shifted afterward.

The side flap description piqued my interest, and I was excited to dive into a new author’s work.\n\n- **Author’s Background and Novel Length:**  \n  This is the author’s first novel, as she typically writes contemporary short stories. I was curious about her decision to write a 600-page story, especially after my positive experience with another lengthy novel, *The Covenant of Water* by Abraham Verghese. However, I wondered if the length served a meaningful purpose in this case.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story seemed to explore themes of drama, grief, resilience, and a menacing supernatural presence that challenged the characters to reflect on what it means to be alive. However, I found the plot confusing and struggled to connect with the characters. I couldn’t discern their purpose or whether they were dead, missing, or in an alternate reality.

Eager to reclaim their lives, the trio agrees to a bargain: they will complete a series of magical tasks that allow them to reconnect with their families, but they must keep their experiences a secret. As they navigate this new reality, their resurrection draws the attention of other supernatural beings with their own agendas. While Laura, Daniel, and Mo confront the remnants of their past, Laura’s sister, Susannah, struggles to reconcile her memories with her fears. As these mysterious figures invade their community, danger and chaos ensue, compelling the teens to unravel the mystery of their deaths to prevent impending disaster.",

I like fantasy, and this one sounded interesting.  \n\n- **Plot Summary:**  \n  Late one night, Laura, Daniel, and Mo find themselves beneath the fluorescent lights of a high school classroom, almost a year after disappearing from their hometown, Lovesend, Massachusetts, having long been presumed dead. With them is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance—and what has brought them back. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to the terms of a bargain proposed by their teacher. They will be given a series of magical tasks; while they undertake them, they may return to their families and friends, but they can tell no one where they’ve been. In the end, there will be winners and losers. However, their resurrection attracts the notice of other supernatural figures with their own agendas. As Laura, Daniel, and Mo grapple with the pieces of the lives they left behind, and Laura’s sister, Susannah, attempts to reconcile her memories with her fears, these mysterious others begin to arrive, engulfing their community in danger and chaos. It becomes imperative that the teens solve the mystery of their deaths to avert a looming disaster.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and atmospheric, almost like a fairy tale.  \n\n- **Creativity and World-Building:**  \n  I liked some of the creative names, such as the band name \"My Two Hands Both Knowe You,\" the coffee shop \"What Hast Thou Ground?,\" and the magical character named Carousel.

I had to force myself to keep reading. Luckily, the second half had more movement and was more engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Connection:**  \n  I couldn’t get invested in any of the characters.

            "The book suffers from a lack of focus, with characters frequently acting and speaking in ways that feel disconnected from their previous thoughts and actions. Pseudo-explanations for post-magical scenarios appear to be tacked on rather than integrated. While there is extensive discussion of magic, actual magical events are sparse. The sinister villains, despite their menacing nature, fail to engage in any truly evil deeds, and their powers—such as transforming people into animals—are underutilized and swiftly reversed, lacking any significant impact.",
            "The characters are strikingly quirky, embodying a blend of awkward teenage moments and a mix of immature adults and childlike grown-ups. Their unusual jadedness and fluid sexuality stand out, yet their actions often lack tenderness, logic, or sensitivity to gender. The narrative creates confusion regarding who is imaginary, who is real, and who possesses magical abilities. The adults fail to behave like adults, while the ancient immortals do not convincingly represent their historical backgrounds, instead speaking in modern slang and connecting with the younger generation.",
            "The prose is whimsical and often hilarious, infused with a sense of menace that transforms the mundane into something intriguing. While the author employs major exposition dumps to convey backstory, these moments can feel jarring and disrupt the narrative flow. Overall, the book is clever and entertaining, featuring a talking cat and fluid physical forms that enhance its playful nature. The tone strikes a balance between menace and humor, resulting in a unique yet occasionally disjointed reading experience.",

This is especially disappointing considering the intriguing potential of the \"Died and Came Back Wrong\" trope, which could have added depth and excitement to the plot.",

Susannah’s increasing prominence in the narrative quickly became off-putting, as I grew weary of her character.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author’s Transition to Novel Form:**  \n  Kelly Link’s exceptional skill as a short story author does not translate well to the novel form. Her signature absurdist whimsy, which adds charm and magic to her short stories, becomes repetitive and frustrating in a longer format. Quirky details evolve into lengthy anecdotes and discursive journeys into the perspectives of characters I found uninteresting, detracting from the already murky central plot.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The novel’s plot revolves around a vague quest, four teenagers with messy relationships, and mysterious forces of good and evil. However, even halfway through, the story fails to gain momentum or coalesce into something propulsive. This is particularly disappointing given the potential of the “Died And Came Back Wrong” trope, which is one of the most fun and interesting concepts out there.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story feels more like a character study of the four main protagonists and their seaside New England town. Unfortunately, I found most of the cast unlikable. Mo was the only protagonist I consistently rooted for, while Daniel and Laura were surprisingly bland. Susannah’s growing role in the story quickly turned me off, as I became endlessly fed up with her character. I was far more intrigued by the arcane pasts of secondary characters like Mr. Anabin, Bogomil, Thomas, and Malo Mogge, and wished their histories and roles were more defined.  \n\n- **Fantastical Elements vs. Mundane Life:**  \n  The fantastical elements of the story often get lost in the mundane ups and downs of the protagonists’ lives. While this could have been an engaging aspect, the lack of compelling characters made it difficult to fully appreciate.  \n\n- **Mythology and Folklore Influence:**  \n  The novel’s strongest aspect is its heavy influence of mythology and folklore, a hallmark of Kelly Link’s work. Echoes of tales like *East of the Sun and West of the Moon*, *Tam Lin*, and other lesser-known folktales add depth and richness to the story. This element feels inspired by her most recent story collection, which focused on retellings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel debut from Kelly Link was somewhat disappointing, especially given my high expectations as a fan of her short stories. While the mythological and folkloric influences were a highlight, the lack of a compelling plot, uneven pacing, and unlikable characters made it a challenging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

They defy conventional plotting and narrative arcs, yet they remain engaging. *The Book of Love* exemplifies this approach, offering a lo-fi exploration of the impossible, rich with insecurities and the subtle nuances of everyday life, rather than relying on constant high-stakes drama.",

It is a triumph that kept me fascinated all the way to the last drop.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Uniqueness:**  \n  I’ve loved Kelly Link’s short fiction for years, but I could never explain how her stories worked. They break so many rules of plotting and arcs, yet they remain compelling. *The Book of Love* continues this trend, presenting a decisively lo-fi novel of the impossible, filled with insecurity and the small details of life rather than constant explosive stakes.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel has an obvious hook: a group of kids is brought back from the dead for a conflict between two ominous figures engaged in a mysterious struggle. However, none of the stories the kids engage in as they try to resume their lives are what you’d expect. Every side-story they get sucked into was something I was hungry to see more of, even with doom dangling over their heads.  \n\n- **Character Development and Internal Lives:**  \n  The book is deeply dedicated to the internal lives of people in impossible circumstances. The kids’ drama and trauma from suddenly existing again are central to the story. Giving them powers doesn’t mean they’ll spin around ready to form Voltron and attack God; instead, their struggles feel authentic and grounded.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Book of Love* is a triumph of speculative fiction, blending the impossible with the deeply personal.

Laura, a musically ambitious teen, returns to her single mother and sister, Susannah, who appears to be linked to the magical ritual that resulted in the death of her friends and may hold the key to their salvation.

The novel begins with an intriguing premise: four teenagers return from the dead, unaware of how they died or why they were resurrected 11 months later.

I dreaded reading it and could only manage by alternating chapters with other books I wasn’t enjoying. The ebook’s tiny font made it feel like I was reading 2,548 pages instead of 637, and my laptop’s slow page-turning added to the frustration.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The first third of the book felt like a brain-murdering task, but my feelings did a complete 180 after that.

The town is unforgettable and unrealistic, and the romances are weird and annoying, but they all worked together to create something truly unique.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book made me feel something—twists, laughs, and tragedies all resonated deeply. For someone with a “cold dark chunk of Christmas coal of a heart,” that’s a significant achievement.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Once I got past the initial slog, I had a really good time.

The librarian’s enthusiasm further piqued my interest, and I decided to prioritize reading it first.\n\n- **Author’s Background and Novel Length:**  \n  This is the author’s first novel, as she typically writes contemporary short stories. The decision to make this a 600-page story felt ambitious, especially since I’ve recently been open to longer novels if they have meaning and purpose.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story seemed to explore drama, grief, resilience, and a menacing supernatural presence that challenged the characters to reflect on what it means to be alive. However, I struggled to connect with the characters and understand their purpose. The ambiguity about whether they were dead, missing, or in an alternate reality left me feeling confused and off balance.\n\n- **Engagement and Clarity:**  \n  I found it difficult to stay engaged with the story due to its lack of clarity. A particular line from a character—“Do you want to be dead, because I don’t. I want to avoid being dead for as long as possible”—left me even more perplexed. I wondered if the story might have been more effective as a short story, where the author could have conveyed her point more succinctly.\n\n- **Decision to Abandon the Book:**  \n  Ultimately, I decided to stop reading the book because I couldn’t find my footing in the narrative.

With them is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance and what has brought them back. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to a series of magical tasks proposed by their teacher. While undertaking these tasks, they may return to their families and friends but can tell no one where they’ve been.

Centered on the trio of Mo, Laura, and Daniel, the story delves into a mysterious disappearance and a supernatural bargain. Rich in symbolism, riddles, and philosophical questions, it offers a compelling and immersive narrative. The intricate structure intertwines each character’s journey with themes of love, loss, and identity.",
            "The characters are richly nuanced, each possessing a distinct personality and arc. Susannah, Laura’s sister, navigates her grief and search for identity, while the trio of friends faces their own fears and transformations. The introduction of a fourth entity adds depth, and secondary characters like Mr. Anabin and Malo Mogge are equally engaging. The interactions and growth of these characters form the emotional heart of the story.",

Rich in anthropomorphic descriptions, riddles, and clues, the prose instills both wonder and unease. The remarkable balance of fantasy and emotional depth makes the story both thought-provoking and engaging.",

The richly detailed setting of Lovesend, where every element—from landmarks to weather—adds to the story's symbolic depth, draws readers in. The interplay of fire and ice, the presence of mythological creatures, and the eerie transformations all contribute to the immersive quality of this world.",
            "The novel explores profound themes, including various forms of love (Philia, Eros, Storge, Agape), the nature of evil, the significance of names, and the duality of life and death.

The plot is layered with symbolism, riddles, and philosophical questions, creating a rich and immersive narrative. The structure is intricate, with each character’s journey interwoven with themes of love, loss, and identity.\n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The characters are deeply nuanced, with each having a distinct personality and arc. Susannah, Laura’s sister, grapples with grief and identity, while the trio of friends confronts their own fears and transformations.

The characters’ interactions and growth drive the emotional core of the story.\n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n  The novel delves into profound themes such as love (Philia, Eros, Storge, Agape), the nature of evil, the power of names, and the duality of life and death. Symbolism is pervasive, from the significance of numbers (three and four) to the use of names and mythological references (e.g., Anubis, Cerberus). The moths, the sculpture, and the town’s name (Lovesend) all carry deeper meanings, enriching the narrative.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Kelly Link’s writing is lyrical and evocative, blending humor, suspense, and philosophical musings. The prose is rich with anthropomorphic descriptions, riddles, and clues, creating a sense of wonder and unease. The author’s ability to balance the fantastical with emotional depth is remarkable, making the story both thought-provoking and engaging.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel resonates deeply, exploring the pain of loss, the enduring nature of love, and the complexities of human relationships. The characters’ struggles with identity, grief, and temptation evoke empathy, while the story’s climax delivers both anticipated and unexpected emotional punches. The tender portrayal of love’s persistence beyond death is particularly moving.\n\n- **World-Building and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel creates a vivid, uncanny atmosphere, blending the mundane with the supernatural. The setting of Lovesend is richly detailed, with every element—from landmarks to weather—contributing to the story’s symbolic depth. The interplay of fire and ice, the presence of mythological creatures, and the eerie transformations all enhance the immersive quality of the world.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKelly Link’s *The Book of Love* is a masterful blend of dark fantasy, mythology, and philosophical inquiry.

            "The book comes across as unfocused, with characters acting and thinking in ways that often feel disconnected from their previous actions and thoughts. The explanations for post-magical events seem tacked on rather than integrated into the narrative. Additionally, the social commentary, while insightful, detracts from the plot, as it highlights the absurdity of the characters' situations without driving the story forward.",
            "The characters are strikingly quirky, embodying awkward teenage moments and a preoccupation with texting and casual sex in unusual settings. Their interactions often lack tenderness and rationale, with minimal consideration for gender dynamics. Aimlessly drifting from one pleasure to another, they confront death and engage with objects meant to be symbolic. The narrative presents a fluidity in both physical forms and sexuality, featuring unsettlingly adult children and immature adults who grapple with the challenges of adulthood.",
            "The prose is whimsical and often hilarious, marked by its unique and playful tone. The author skillfully blends the mundane with a hint of menace, creating a relaxed atmosphere. However, there are significant exposition dumps, especially regarding ancient immortals who, despite their origins in the 1600s, speak and act with a modern flair, incorporating contemporary slang and culture.",
            "While the story features plenty of discussions about magic, genuine magical events are rare. The magic system lacks clear rules, and characters fail to engage with it in significant ways, often resorting to trivial tasks like cleaning stains. Additionally, the distinction between who can wield magic and who cannot is muddled, leading to confusion about what is real and what is imaginary.",

However, her exceptional skill as a short story author does not translate well to the novel form. Her signature absurdist whimsy, which infuses her short stories with charm and magic, becomes repetitive and frustrating in a longer format.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The central plot is murky and fails to coalesce into anything propulsive, even halfway through the story. While there is a vague quest, four teenagers with messy relationships, and looming forces of good and evil, the narrative lacks focus. Quirky details evolve into long anecdotes and discursive journeys into the perspectives of characters I found uninteresting, detracting from the main storyline.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story feels more like a character study of the four main protagonists and their seaside New England town. Unfortunately, I found most of the cast unlikable. Mo was the only protagonist I consistently rooted for, while Daniel and Laura were surprisingly bland. Susannah’s growing role in the story quickly turned me off, as I became endlessly fed up with her. I was far more intrigued by the arcane pasts of secondary characters like Mr. Anabin, Bogomil, Thomas, and Malo Mogge, and wished their histories were more defined.  \n\n- **Fantastical Elements vs. Mundane Life:**  \n  The fantastical elements of the story often get lost in the mundane ups and downs of the protagonists’ lives. While I appreciated the heavy influence of mythology and folklore—echoes of *East of the Sun and West of the Moon*, *Tam Lin*, and other lesser-known folktales—these elements were not enough to salvage the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a somewhat disappointing novel debut from one of my favorite authors.

They break so many rules of plotting and arcs, and yet they're fascinating all the way to the last drop. The same goes here for *The Book of Love*.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel has an obvious hook: a bunch of kids are brought back from the dead for a conflict between two ominous figures who are in a mysterious struggle against each other. But none of the stories the kids engage in as they try to resume their lives are what you'd expect. It is a decisively lo-fi novel of the impossible, filled with insecurity and the small details of life, rather than constant explosive stakes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  Because those kids are going to have their own drama and trauma from suddenly existing again, and giving them powers doesn't mean they'll spin around ready to form Voltron and attack God. Every side-story they get sucked into is something I was hungry to see more of, even if doom was dangling over their heads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Book of Love* is a captivating and unconventional novel that masterfully explores the internal lives of its characters in impossible circumstances.

Some characters, like Thomas/Kristopher/Avelot, would have been better suited for a prequel, while Mo’s mom and grandmother could have been their own short story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Repetition:**  \n  The pacing suffers due to frequent interruptions and repetition.

The title doesn’t seem to align with the story, and the moon motif is only briefly and haphazardly mentioned at the end, making it feel irrelevant.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the concept is imaginative, the excessive focus on character backstories and repetitive elements significantly interfered with my enjoyment and the suspense-building.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book has a fascinating concept but is bogged down by an overwhelming number of characters, repetitive storytelling, and a lack of focus on the main plot.

The librarian’s enthusiasm further piqued my interest, and I decided to prioritize reading it first due to its popularity and limited borrowing time.\n\n- **Author’s Background and Novel Length:**  \n  This is the author’s first novel, as she typically writes contemporary short stories. The decision to make this a 600-page story felt ambitious, especially since I’ve recently been open to longer novels if they have meaning and purpose. However, I was unsure where this story was headed.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The novel seemed to explore themes of drama, grief, resilience, and a menacing supernatural presence that challenged the characters to reflect on what it means to be alive. However, I found the plot confusing and struggled to connect with the characters. Their purpose and reality were unclear—were they dead, missing, or in an alternate reality? This ambiguity left me feeling off balance.\n\n- **Character Engagement and Clarity:**  \n  I had difficulty understanding the characters’ motivations and their place in the story. A particular line from one character—“Do you want to be dead, because I don’t. I want to avoid being dead for as long as possible”—left me even more confused. I wondered if the story might have been more effective as a short story, where the author could have conveyed her point more succinctly.\n\n- **Reading Experience and Decision to Abandon:**  \n  Despite my initial excitement, I ultimately had to abandon the book due to its lack of clarity and my inability to connect with the narrative. I hope the next reader enjoys it more and finds it easier to follow.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and explored meaningful themes, its confusing plot and lack of character clarity made it difficult for me to engage with the story.

Although the premise and writing are technically strong, the story fails to delve into deeper themes, lacking the significant message one might expect from a 600-page adult fantasy. Instead of the darker, more complex tone typical of the genre, the narrative remains light and centered on youthful antics, creating a disconnect with its marketing."

It lacked the large message expected of a 600-page adult fantasy novel.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  The book is branded as an adult fantasy, but it feels more like a young adult novel. The characters are 17-18 years old, and much of the story revolves around their interpersonal teenage problems, such as love/relationship issues and family dynamics.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story is told from the perspectives of at least 6 or 7 teenagers. Some were more interesting than others, but all had a solid mix of personal struggles.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic in the book felt underdeveloped and inconsistent. Characters morph into animals like bears, seagulls, and tigers without much explanation. While there was an initial explanation for why certain characters could use magic, this was largely abandoned by the end. The magic was often used for trivial purposes, such as convincing parents to extend curfew or tricking salespeople into giving away items.  \n\n- **Pacing and Length:**  \n  The story is set over the course of days but spans 600 pages, making it feel overly long and drawn out. A tighter execution would have improved the reading experience.  \n\n- **Tone and Expectations:**  \n  The book lacked the darker or more sinister tone expected from an adult fantasy novel. Instead, it remained light and focused on teenage antics, which felt mismatched with its marketing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise and technical writing were strong, the book fell short of delivering a meaningful or mature narrative expected of an adult fantasy novel. Its young adult themes, underdeveloped magic system, and excessive length made it feel misbranded and overstretched. A more accurate pitch and tighter execution could have made it a more compelling read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The characters’ personalities often clash with their backgrounds, resulting in unrealistic and unconvincing behavior.

            "The novel marks a significant expansion of the author's exploration of magic and the supernatural, transitioning from short stories to a full-length narrative. Centered on three main characters—Mo, Laura, and Daniel—the story delves into a mysterious disappearance, a purgatorial realm, and a return to reality accompanied by a supernatural hitchhiker. Rich with symbolism, riddles, and philosophical inquiries, the plot offers an immersive experience. Its tight structure and brisk pacing create the illusion of a shorter novel, propelling the story swiftly toward its climax. Unexpected twists and dissonant events keep the reader on edge, while the emotional depth and philosophical reflections ensure the narrative lingers long after the final page.",
            "The characters are richly nuanced, each embodying a narrative reminiscent of Biblical figures. Susannah, Laura’s sister, wrestles with grief and identity, while the trio navigates their return to reality and the consequences of their supernatural experiences. Their names and roles carry symbolic weight, echoing themes of power, justice, knowledge, rebirth, and victory. The dynamics among the characters are engaging, filled with moments of humor, fear, and introspection that drive their growth.",

It examines various forms of love—Philia, Eros, Storge, and Agape—and questions whether love endures beyond death. Rich in symbolism, the narrative uses the number four to represent stability and creation, while moths symbolize transformation. Additionally, it delves into the duality of good and evil, the significance of names, and the repercussions of making bargains."

The story begins with a captivating premise: four teenagers return from the dead, oblivious to how they died or why they’ve been resurrected 11 months later. They must solve a magical dilemma to continue living.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author and Expectations:**  \n  Kelly Link is one of my favorite short story authors, and I was excited to read her debut novel, which is 650 pages long. I bought it on the day of release but took a few months to start it. I had heard it described as slow, but I would characterize it as leisurely.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n  The novel opens with an intriguing premise: four teenagers return from the dead, unaware of how they died or why they were brought back 11 months later. They must solve a magical problem to continue living. However, the book is less of a mystery and more of a close examination of the teens' lives in a small New England town in December.  \n\n- **Characters and Development:**  \n  The teens include Danial, the oldest of many step-siblings, who rejects his new magical powers and desires a small, ordinary life. Mo, who lost his parents young, was raised by his grandmother, a famous Black romance novelist, who died during the 11 months he spent in the underworld. Laura, a musically ambitious teen, returns to her single mom and sister Susannah, who seems entangled with the magical ritual that killed and might save her friends. There’s also a fourth person, unknown to the others, who escaped death on their coattails and has no name or memories.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book rotates points of view every chapter, featuring more than 15 different POVs, some of whom appear only once. I love Link’s writing style, so this worked for me, but I can see how the choice to linger over details not directly related to the plot might not appeal to all readers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Reading Experience:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book, but it took me three weeks to read. I suggest other readers pick it up when they’re ready for a slow burn.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKelly Link’s debut novel is a leisurely, character-driven exploration of life, death, and magic, set in a small New England town. While its slow pace and multiple POVs may not suit everyone, I found it deeply engaging and reflective of Link’s unique storytelling style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
