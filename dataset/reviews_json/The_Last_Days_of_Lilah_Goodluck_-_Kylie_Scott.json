            "The more compelling storyline—Lilah's impending doom and her battle against fate—was overshadowed by Alistair's backstory and their romance. The resolution of Lilah's prophecy came across as lazy and unsatisfying, ultimately diminishing the story's impact.",
            "Lilah starts off as a strong, independent female lead with clear ambitions for her life before an impending death. However, her character development falters once she meets Alistair, leading her to abandon her goals for a relationship that feels stifling. Alistair, the love interest, is portrayed as a moody and controlling alpha male whose only redeeming quality is his physical attractiveness. His backstory—being the illegitimate son of a British king with a troubled past—comes off as forced and fails to evoke sympathy. The relationship between Lilah and Alistair lacks depth and emotional resonance, which is disappointing given its central role in the plot. Their dynamic feels unbalanced, with Lilah sacrificing her independence for a man who is emotionally distant and domineering. The romance echoes a poorly executed version of a 50 Shades of Grey narrative, lacking the nuance and compelling emotion that would make it resonate.",
            "The writing was witty, detailed, and occasionally graphic, highlighting the author's talent for crafting engaging prose. However, the narrative choices and emphasis on less pertinent plot threads detracted from the story's overall potential.",

It centers on Lilah, a young woman who is prophesied to live only nine more days, facing the choice of battling her fate or fully embracing her remaining time. However, the narrative strays considerably from this premise, shifting focus to a romantic subplot that ultimately overshadows the main theme. While the book isn't entirely disappointing, it failed to connect with me on an emotional level. The romantic relationship felt lackluster and detracted from my investment in the story. Overall, it reads more like a light distraction than a deeply impactful experience."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The book had a promising premise and a strong start with Lilah's character, but it ultimately fell short due to its focus on a shallow and unbalanced romantic relationship. The sidelining of Lilah's more compelling storyline and the unsatisfying resolution of her prophecy left me disappointed. While the writing was engaging, the narrative choices made it clear that this book was not for me.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Expectations:**  \n   - The premise of the book was intriguing and initially hooked me. The synopsis suggested a story about a young woman, Lilah, who is prophesized to have only nine days to live and must decide whether to fight her fate or live her remaining days fully.  \n   - However, the story deviated significantly from this expectation, focusing more on a romantic subplot that overshadowed the original premise.  \n\n- **Characterization (Lilah):**  \n   - Lilah was a strong female lead at the beginning—witty, independent, and with a clear list of things she wanted to accomplish before her supposed death.  \n   - Her character development took a disappointing turn after meeting Alistair, as she abandoned her goals and became consumed by her relationship with him.  \n\n- **Characterization (Alistair):**  \n   - Alistair, the love interest, was portrayed as a moody, snobby, uncommunicative, and controlling alpha-male with little redeeming qualities beyond his physical attractiveness.  \n   - His backstory (being the bastard son of a British king with a troubled childhood) was meant to make him sympathetic but felt forced and unengaging.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship:**  \n   - The relationship between Lilah and Alistair lacked depth and emotional connection, which was disappointing given its centrality to the plot.  \n   - Their dynamic felt unbalanced, with Lilah sacrificing her independence and goals for a man who was controlling and emotionally distant.  \n   - The romance resembled a poorly executed attempt at a \"50 Shades of Grey\"-style story, lacking the nuance and emotional resonance of a compelling love story.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n   - The more interesting storyline—Lilah's impending doom and her struggle with her fate—was sidelined in favor of Alistair's backstory and their romance.  \n   - The resolution of Lilah's prophecy felt lazy and unsatisfying, further diminishing the impact of the story.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - The writing was witty, detailed, and at times very graphic, showcasing the author's skill in crafting engaging prose.  \n   - However, the narrative choices and focus on the wrong plot threads undermined the potential of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Target Audience:**  \n   - While the book is not awful, it failed to resonate with me emotionally. The romantic relationship left a bad taste in my mouth, making it hard to care about the rest of the story.  \n   - It feels like a casual, quick read meant for daydreaming rather than delivering significant emotional impact.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a promising premise and a strong start with Lilah's character, but it ultimately fell short due to its focus on a shallow and unbalanced romantic relationship. The sidelining of Lilah's more compelling storyline and the unsatisfying resolution of her prophecy left me disappointed. While the writing was engaging, the narrative choices made it clear that this book was not for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This one definitely wouldn’t go on my \"smokin’ hot read\" shelf.  \n\n- **Believability of Romance:**  \n  Despite the story taking place over a short period of time (one week), I found the love between the characters believable. We got to see them genuinely get to know each other, which made their connection feel real.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Depth:**  \n  One thing that bothered me was that Lilah never actually told Alistair she loved him. This always bugs me in books when it happens. However, Alistair did some very sweet things for her, like helping her with the items on her list, such as the convertible drive and the *Pretty Woman*-style shopping scene where she could buy anything she wanted.  \n\n- **Pacing and Timeline:**  \n  The story’s timeline was very fast, and I would’ve liked more time with the characters. I definitely wanted to see more of them together because they were cute as a couple.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  It was a pretty cute story overall and an enjoyable read, especially since I read it on my birthday. It was also nice to read an actual physical book after a long time.  \n\n- **Favorite Quote:**  \n  💙 *\"It took me a long time to find you. I refuse to lose you now.\"*  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a lighthearted, enjoyable read with a believable romance and plenty of funny moments. While I would’ve liked more time with the characters and a deeper emotional resolution (like Lilah confessing her love), it was still a solid, cute story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nSolid 3-star read."

While the premise of a fortune teller predicting Lilah’s death and lottery win is intriguing, it remains underdeveloped. The bucket list concept has potential but feels rushed, resembling a montage rather than a meaningful exploration. Additionally, the romance escalates too quickly, transitioning from strangers to committed partners in just a week. A longer timeline would have allowed for a more gradual and believable development.",
            "The characters in this story lack depth and development. Lilah's role as a librarian or book lover is minimally explored, and her friend is scarcely present. Alistair's background as a video game creator and the son of royalty is acknowledged but not fully fleshed out. Although his reputation as the type of guy women date before finding their soulmate is introduced, it isn’t meaningfully examined. As a result, the characters' actions and motivations often appear random or unexplained, diminishing their authenticity.",

            "The 'predicted death' trope is masterfully executed, despite its familiarity. The premise is captivating: Lilah saves a fortune teller who reveals her soulmate's name, Alistair, predicts her death, and shares lottery numbers. The narrative delves into Lilah's struggle with her impending demise and her choices for her final days.",
            "I was captivated by the two main characters, Lilah and Alistair. Lilah, a relatable plus-sized librarian, is endearing, while Alistair, the illegitimate son of the King of England, evolves emotionally throughout the story. Their romance unfolds quickly, but the writing is so engaging that the pace felt just right. The witty banter and deep emotional connection between them enrich the narrative, and the steamy scenes are skillfully crafted, enhancing the overall romance.",

            "The story centers on two key tropes: Lilah’s conviction that she is destined to die after a series of eerily accurate predictions, including her encounter with Alistair (Ali), the illegitimate son of the British king, and the complexities of dating a royal. While the royal family theme offers some entertainment, it didn't fully engage me; however, it did introduce the standout character, Ali’s mother, Lady Helena.",
            "The romance between Lilah and Ali lacks the swoonworthy moments one might expect. It unfolds straightforwardly, avoiding unnecessary drama, which I appreciated. Their relationship is efficiently developed, with doubts and challenges addressed without slowing the narrative. While the characters are often exaggerated for comedic effect—sometimes successfully—this approach doesn't always land. Lady Helena stands out as the most memorable and entertaining character, her wild antics stealing the spotlight. In contrast, Lilah’s parents, particularly her mother, come across as inconsistent, with reactions that feel forced and vary from scene to scene.",

The plot masterfully combines heartwarming moments, witty dialogue, and steamy encounters. Its fast pacing makes for a cozy yet engaging read that kept me thoroughly invested. A standout element is the surprising twist involving the predicted ‘soulmate,’ who turns out to be a hot, well-known figure with an unexpected royal connection.",
            "Lilah’s humor shines through despite her challenging circumstances, showcasing her commendable resilience. Her ability to navigate life with a sense of self-worth, even in the face of insecurities, is both relatable and empowering. Ali, with his sweet and kind-hearted nature, demonstrates genuine generosity towards Lilah from the start. Their connection, though brief, feels authentic; however, Ali's assertiveness sometimes overshadows Lilah’s hesitations. Lady Helena, Ali’s mother, stands out with her lively humor, adding a delightful energy to the narrative—her backstory would make a wonderful spin-off. The book also features refreshing plus-size representation, handled with care. Classic tropes like the bucket list, a Pretty Woman-style shopping spree, and the grumpy-sunshine dynamic are effectively executed, further enhancing the story’s charm.",

            "The story opens with Lilah attending her best friend's birthday party, where a psychic named Good Witch Willow predicts several life-altering events, including Lilah's imminent death in a week.

Their friendship blossoms into a slow-burn romance, with Alistair's jealousy and deepening feelings adding intriguing layers to his character. The side characters, especially Alistair’s mother, Lady Helena, are well-developed and entertaining.

            "This book offers a light and humorous romance centered on the protagonist, Lilah, as seen through her eyes. The storyline is engaging, even if it initially hints at a less-than-happy ending. When Lilah receives five predictions from Good Witch Willow, one reveals she has just one week to live. Undeterred, she bravely crafts a bucket list to accomplish in that time. I found Lilah’s courage inspiring and even contemplated trying some of her bucket list ideas myself.",
            "Alistair, the royal love interest, is portrayed as Lilah's destined soulmate. While I appreciated his support in helping her with her bucket list, his grumpy demeanor often hindered a deeper connection. Although there were swoon-worthy moments in their romance, I found it difficult to fully invest in their relationship. Alistair frequently distanced himself, leaving Lilah uncertain about his feelings, and the tension from their royal/non-royal dynamic added complexity to the story.",
            "Having enjoyed the author's previous works, I was eager to read *The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck*. However, it fell short of my expectations. While I liked it, I can’t say I loved it, which was disappointing given my usual enthusiasm for this author's books."

However, the lack of dual POV and my inability to fully connect with Alistair made it less enjoyable than I had hoped. While it’s not a personal favorite, I would still recommend it to readers who enjoy light romantic comedies with funny moments and a touch of celebrity or royal romance.",

However, it didn’t quite meet my expectations. I liked it but didn’t love it, which was disappointing because I usually enjoy Kylie’s books.  \n\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n   - The book was a light and funny romance read, focusing solely on the FMC, Lilah, from her POV.  \n   - The storyline was engaging, even though it initially seemed like it might not have a happily-ever-after (HEA). The FMC receives five predictions from Good Witch Willow, one of which is that she only has one week to live. Despite this, Lilah remains courageous and creates a bucket list to complete within the week.  \n   - I found Lilah’s courage inspiring and even considered using some of her bucket list ideas for myself.  \n\n- **Romance and Character Dynamics:**  \n   - The love interest, Alistair (Ali), is a royal figure who becomes Lilah’s soulmate as predicted. I enjoyed how he helped Lilah with her bucket list, though his grumpy and confusing demeanor made it hard to fully connect with him.  \n   - The romance had swoon-worthy moments, but I wasn’t fully invested in Lilah and Alistair’s relationship. Alistair often ran away, leaving Lilah unsure of his feelings, and the royal/non-royal dynamic added tension.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and POV:**  \n   - The book read more like Women’s Fiction at first due to the single POV (Lilah’s). I wish Alistair’s POV had been included, as it might have made me more invested in their romance.  \n   - Alistair initially came off as a player, which made it harder to root for him.  \n\n- **Predictions and HEA:**  \n   - I was more focused on whether Lilah’s predictions would come true and how she would achieve her HEA. Kylie Scott delivered on the HEA, which was satisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck* was an okay read for me.

            "The fairytale element is introduced right away when Lilah receives several predictions from the delightful Good Witch Willow. These predictions include the name of her soulmate—who happens to be famous, wealthy, and local—as well as the date of her death, which is alarmingly soon (just a week from Sunday). After the first predictions begin to come true, including a near miss with her soulmate's car, Lilah understandably panics. However, being a romance, everything ultimately falls into place, offering plenty of enjoyable moments along the way.",
            "The story is entirely from Lilah's perspective, making her feel like a relatable character striving to navigate her challenges. Alastair also grapples with his own issues, which adds depth to his character. The supporting cast, including Lilah’s parents and Alastair’s mother, brings an enjoyable dynamic, and both protagonists are surrounded by great friends.",
            "Alastair, the illegitimate son of the King of England, is introduced early in the story. As a fan of historical romance, I often view the prevalence of dukes and aristocrats as mere fantasy. However, this becomes more jarring in contemporary settings, where I struggle to distinguish between fictional nobility and reality, especially when it involves a real monarchy. My recent reading of *Spare* only complicates this perception. While I’m unsure if the author intended social commentary, I can’t help but interpret it that way. If this weren’t written by an author I admire, I likely would have passed on it. This same discomfort is why I’ve avoided *Red, White, and Royal Blue*, despite its glowing reviews.",
            "*The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck* fits the archetype of a story centered around an everywoman paired with a famous or wealthy man. This narrative dynamic often engages me. In contrast, I also appreciate tales that feature two ordinary characters, such as *Repeat*, *Pause*, and various zombie novels."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck* is a delightful fairytale romance with strong character development, a fun plot, and engaging supporting characters. While the contemporary aristocracy element feels a bit jarring, the overall story is highly recommended. It’s a strong 4-star read for me, with the potential to become a 5-star favorite on re-reads.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Overall Enjoyment and Rating:**  \n   - This was a very strong 4-star read for me. I am very stingy with 5 stars and reserve them for favorites I revisit over time. It is extremely rare for me to consider a new book a 5-star read, though this review may shift to 5 stars on re-reads.  \n\n- **Genre and Comparison to Other Works:**  \n   - *The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck* falls into the Kylie Scott category of \"everywoman with a famous/rich/both man.\" I consider the Stage Dive series, *Famous in a Small Town*, and *Fake* to be in this category. The second category, where both main characters are \"normal\" people, includes *Repeat*, *Pause*, and the Dive Bar series, as well as the zombie books.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Character Development:**  \n   - The story is told entirely from Lilah's point of view, and she feels like a real person doing the best she can. Alastair has his own issues to work through, which I always appreciate. Lilah's parents and Alastair's mother are a lot of fun, and both Lilah and Alastair seem to have great friends.  \n\n- **Plot and Fairytale Elements:**  \n   - The fairytale aspect comes into play immediately. Lilah is given several predictions by Good Witch Willow (a fun character!), including the name of her soulmate (famous, rich, and local) and the date of her death (a week from Sunday). When the first couple of predictions come true, and she nearly runs into her soulmate's car the next day, Lilah understandably freaks out. It's a romance, so it all works out, and there’s a lot of fun along the way.  \n\n- **Setting and Social Commentary:**  \n   - Alastair is the bastard son of the King of England, which we learn early on. As someone who reads a lot of historical romance, I usually treat the overabundance of dukes and aristocracy as a fantasy world. However, I find it much weirder in contemporary settings. My brain struggles to separate fake aristocracy from the real world, especially when it involves a real country's king. Having recently listened to *Spare* doesn’t help. I’m not sure if there’s intended social commentary here, but I process it that way. If this weren’t written by an author whose books I really like, I would have skipped it because of this. It’s also why I can’t bring myself to read *Red, White, and Royal Blue* despite stellar reviews.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Last Days of Lilah Goodluck* is a delightful fairytale romance with strong character development, a fun plot, and engaging supporting characters. While the contemporary aristocracy element feels a bit jarring, the overall story is highly recommended. It’s a strong 4-star read for me, with the potential to become a 5-star favorite on re-reads.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 4 stars (with potential to shift to 5 stars on re-reads)."

            "The story unfolds rapidly over the course of a week, which maintains a brisk narrative pace but ultimately makes the romantic development feel rushed and implausible. The structure is marred by a repetitive emphasis on Alistaire's physicality and reliance on predictable romantic tropes, diminishing the overall appeal. Serving as a light summer read, the book offers escapism without demanding much thought. It blends elements of *Pretty Woman* and *Fifty Shades of Grey*, featuring an improbable love story. The plot follows Lilah, who receives witch's premonitions about winning the lottery, discovering her ex's infidelity, losing a promotion, meeting her soulmate (Alistaire), and confronting her impending death—all within a week. While the premise is intriguing, the story becomes overly cheesy and redundant halfway through, particularly with its incessant focus on Alistaire's physical attributes and sexual prowess.",
            "The main characters, Lilah and Alistaire, can be frustrating due to their repetitive interactions and the unrealistic pace of their emotional connection. Lilah's rapid obsession with Alistaire feels rushed and unconvincing. In contrast, the secondary characters, especially Lilah’s parents and Lady Helena (Alistaire’s mother), stand out as the most enjoyable and entertaining elements of the story.",
            "The dialogue occasionally sparkles with wit, but it often veers into clichés and overly cutesy exchanges that can be off-putting. Additionally, the writing style heavily relies on chick-lit tropes, which may not resonate with all readers.",
            "While the book has its flaws, it remains engaging enough to read quickly, particularly for romance enthusiasts willing to suspend disbelief. The intrigue surrounding the resolution of the death premonition adds depth to the story, resulting in a mixed overall experience."

While the premise is intriguing, the story becomes overly cheesy and redundant halfway through, particularly with the repetitive focus on Alistaire’s physical attributes and sexual prowess.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters, Lilah and Alistaire, are somewhat irritating due to their repetitive interactions and the unrealistic speed of their emotional connection.

The writing style leans heavily into chick-lit tropes, which may not appeal to all readers.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story’s pacing is fast, with the entire plot unfolding within a week. While this keeps the narrative moving quickly, it also makes the romantic development feel rushed and less believable.

            "In this engaging story, Lilah Goodluck, a book-loving librarian, finds her life turned upside down after saving a witch from a car accident. The witch offers several predictions, which Lilah initially dismisses. However, when she discovers her new boyfriend cheating, misses out on a promotion, and has an unexpected encounter with a celebrity—all foretold by the witch—her skepticism begins to wane. Her concerns deepen when she correctly picks 5 out of 6 lottery numbers based on another prediction. With the witch's final ominous forecast of her death on Sunday looming, Lilah decides to tackle her bucket list. She receives reluctant but growing support from Alistair, the celebrity she nearly collided with in a parking lot, who the witch also claimed is her soulmate. This story beautifully blends humor, romance, and a touch of magic as Lilah embarks on a journey of self-discovery and adventure.",
            "Lilah is an upbeat and sassy character who isn't intimidated by Alistair or his royal British family's fame. In contrast, Alistair's serious demeanor contrasts sharply with Lilah's vibrant spirit, making her a much-needed source of joy in his otherwise sterile life. Despite the plot leaning into insta-love, their romance felt believable and genuine.",
            "Upon reading the description, I anticipated that the plot could either veer into comedy or delve into darker themes. Fortunately, it struck a perfect balance. Lilah and Alastair engage in witty banter as they tackle her list, yet the underlying gravity of her impending death consistently hovers in the background. I particularly appreciated that the tone remained refreshingly light without tipping into angst.",
            "I appreciated that Lilah's bucket list consisted of simple, manageable goals—things I would also consider tackling if faced with a similar prediction.",
            "I simply wished the book were longer, as I found myself completely engrossed in it.",
            "I have consistently enjoyed the author's books, and this one is no exception."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This novel by the author delivers a unique and engaging story with a perfect balance of humor and gravity. The characters are well-developed, and the romance feels believable despite its quick progression. The relatable bucket list and the underlying tension of Lilah's predicted death keep me hooked. While I wished for a longer book, it was thoroughly enjoyable and lived up to the author's consistent quality.",

Thankfully, it did neither.\"  \n  - \"Lilah and Alastair banter their way through various items on her list, but at the same time, there's an undertone of gravity to the plot due to the prediction of her death that is always there in the background.\"  \n  - \"I appreciated that the tone didn't ever get too angsty.\"  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  - \"Lilah is generally upbeat, sassy, and not at all overwhelmed by Alistair or his royal British family's fame.\"  \n  - \"Alistair is way too serious and desperately needs the shot of joy and sunshine that Lilah brings into his rather sterile existence.\"  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  - \"The plot revolved around a healthy dose of insta-love, but I still believed in their romance.\"  \n\n- **Bucket List and Relatability:**  \n  - \"I also loved that Lilah's bucket list wasn't anything too extravagant or difficult to execute but rather were the types of things I might try to do also if I had received such a prediction.\"  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  - \"I only wish the book was longer as I was totally engrossed in it.\"  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  - \"My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an advance copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions in this review are my own.\"  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel by Kylie Scott delivers a unique and engaging story with a perfect balance of humor and gravity.

As a longtime fan of the author, I found this book to be just as charming and enjoyable as her previous works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative then focuses on the time Lilah spends with Alistair, the prince, during her final days, which at times feels unrealistic and tedious. It’s disheartening that Lilah neglects her loved ones and personal aspirations for a sudden romance, a trope that could have been explored more thoughtfully.",
            "Lilah's character showed promise but was hindered by repetitive traits, particularly her incessant reminders of her librarian role and love for books, which felt excessive. At 30, her behavior and pop culture references made her seem younger than her age. In contrast, Lady Helena and Dougal emerged as the standout characters, adding significant depth to the story.",

However, the story, which should have centered on Lilah, ended up revolving entirely around Alistair and his personal life. This shift in focus made the narrative less engaging for me, to the point where I started skimming through parts of the book.  \n\n- **Character Development and Chemistry:**  \n  Lilah and Alistair lacked any meaningful chemistry. Their interactions felt forced, and the steamy scenes were off-putting rather than romantic. Alistair, as the illegitimate son of the King of England, was an interesting character, but his dominance in the story overshadowed Lilah’s journey, making her feel underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Writing and Execution:**  \n  While the premise had potential, the execution fell short. The story didn’t deliver the emotional depth or connection I was hoping for. I’ve enjoyed Kylie’s previous works, particularly the Stage Dive series, but this book didn’t meet the same standard.  \n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n  The best part of the book is undoubtedly the cover, which is visually appealing and well-designed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite an intriguing premise and high expectations based on the author’s previous works, this book didn’t resonate with me.

Their flirty banter drew me in, making me a believer in their romance and the depth of their connection as soulmates. The author skillfully executed the soulmate trope, which can often miss the mark, but here it truly shone. Witnessing their love unfold was a delightful experience. Lilah, a witty and relatable bookish librarian, perfectly complements Alistair, a charming and protective book boyfriend who matches her in both humor and enthusiasm. His determination to shield her from the ominous prediction of her death adds an intriguing layer to their sweet romance.",

Their flirty banter had me hooked, and I was completely sold on their romance and how crazy they were about each other. Scott did a superb job in showing how they were soulmates. The soulmates trope is not always done well, but when it is, it’s one of my weaknesses. Seeing the two of them falling in love was an amazing treat and one that I’m glad I was able to witness.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Lilah is witty and totally relatable as a bookish librarian. Alistair is a sexy book boyfriend who matches her in wit and craziness. He’s also the sweetest man, wanting to protect her from the most dangerous prediction—the date of her death.  \n\n- **Narrative Style and Tone:**  \n  Scott’s narrative is funny and very, very sexy. The book was a fun romp, and I enjoyed her storytelling. I’m starting to think that numerous spicy scenes in one novel are a must-have in any romance I read. There are numerous ones here, but each scene adds to their relationship and feelings for each other, showing how deeply they are falling in love.  \n\n- **Author’s Back Catalogue:**  \n  I’m so glad that Scott has an extensive back catalogue, as I cannot wait to get my hands on more of her novels.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of witty banter, sizzling chemistry, and heartfelt romance. Scott masterfully crafts a story that is both fun and emotionally engaging, with well-developed characters and a narrative that keeps you hooked.

I would recommend it and look forward to the author’s future works, as there is clear potential for growth.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had a strong and intriguing premise, but the execution fell short in some areas, particularly in character development and the depth of the central relationship. While it didn’t fully live up to its potential, it was still an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to fans of the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
