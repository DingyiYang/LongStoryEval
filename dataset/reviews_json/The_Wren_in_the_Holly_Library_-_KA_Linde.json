It’s a story of revenge, broken people, and the importance of trust over love.  \n  - The tone is far from cozy; it’s a dark adventure that takes you to a grim version of New York.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - There were too many characters, which made it hard to develop deep connections between them.  \n  - Family is mentioned as a central theme, but it didn’t feel emotionally impactful because there wasn’t enough time to explore those relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  - Important plot points often came after unnecessary interludes and lengthy descriptions, which made the story feel confusing at times.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the story has stayed with me, and I found it deeply compelling.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel surprised me with its depth and dark tone, offering more than just a tale of magic and monsters. While the abundance of characters and pacing issues detracted from the emotional impact, the story’s themes of revenge and trust left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

Thankfully, it wasn’t just good—it was amazing!  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The pacing at the beginning threw me off a little; things seemed to move very fast. However, once I got into the story, everything fell into place perfectly.  \n\n- **Character Development (Kierse):**  \n  Kierse is such a badass female main character (FMC). Despite being dealt crappy cards, she persevered through it all and came out stronger on the other side. I loved how much she learned about herself throughout the story while staying true to who she was at heart: a thief.  \n\n- **Character Development (Graves):**  \n  The glimpses we got of Graves kept me wanting more throughout the book. I can’t wait to learn more about him as the series progresses, especially after that ending!  \n\n- **Romance and Plot Balance:**  \n  One thing I loved about this story is that it wasn’t solely focused on romance. While romance is important to me, I appreciated that there was a mission they were trying to achieve, and we got to see how they accomplished it.  \n\n- **Genre Appeal:**  \n  If you enjoy romance, fantasy, and heists, this book is definitely worth a read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book exceeded my expectations with its amazing storytelling, well-developed characters, and balanced mix of romance and action. The pacing took some getting used to, but once I was immersed, I couldn’t put it down. Kierse’s journey and the intriguing glimpses of Graves left me eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

She’s a trained thief who loves stealing, and her personality was captivating. Graves, the brooding, mysterious, and powerful monster who hates her, was equally compelling. Their relationship had me in a genuine chokehold.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writing was absolutely gorgeous and transported me so deeply into the story that I stayed up until 4 a.m. to finish it. The tension between Raeve and Graves was written so perfectly that it had my jaw on the floor, even though the spice level wasn’t particularly high.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  Should I have seen some of the twists coming? Yes. But I didn’t, and they completely rocked my world when they were revealed. The story kept me on the edge of my seat.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  I was so engrossed in the book that I had to put it down at work because I was blushing so much from the tension between the characters. It’s a story that left a lasting impression on me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a must-read. The combination of a modern fantasy setting, well-developed characters, gorgeous writing, and unexpected twists made it an unforgettable experience. I can’t stop talking about it and am eagerly waiting for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Keirse, who is hired by Graves for a high-stakes heist. The pacing is medium, and once I was drawn in, I couldn't put it down. However, I was slightly disappointed by the brevity of the heist itself, especially after the extensive build-up. I must admit, I didn't see the ending coming, which was a pleasant surprise. While some plot points were easier to predict, that didn't detract from my enjoyment. I'm eagerly awaiting the announcement of the next book to find out what happens next. I would definitely recommend this read.",
            "In this story, Keirse is unaware of her magical abilities until Graves steps in to mentor her. As they navigate this journey together, their bond deepens into something more than friendship. The narrative is primarily told in the third person, occasionally interspersed with interludes focusing on side characters. I found these interludes particularly engaging, as they reveal insights that Keirse herself lacks.",

It is a loose *Beauty and the Beast* retelling based on Celtic myths and lore. The book contains elements of other famous stories such as *ACOTAR* and *Twilight*, which I personally really loved, but I can understand why others might dislike that.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story focuses on Keirse, who gets hired by Graves to do a very high-stakes heist. The story is medium-paced, and once I was captured by it, I couldn’t put it down. However, I was a little disappointed by how relatively short the heist was, given the build-up. Call me unobservant, but I genuinely didn’t see the ending coming. Other things were a bit easier to guess, but I don’t really mind that in a book.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Keirse doesn’t know that she has magic, but Graves takes her under his wing to teach her. Along the way, they get drawn to each other in a more-than-friendship manner. The book is written in third person, sometimes alternated with an interlude on one of the side characters. I found these interludes very interesting, as they provide information that Keirse doesn’t have.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Accessibility:**  \n  The book is written in third person, which works well for the story. It’s a nice book and quite an easy-to-follow fantasy read, especially for someone new to the genre.  \n\n- **Ending and Anticipation for Sequels:**  \n  I really hope the next book is announced soon because I want to know what’s going to happen next.

The similarities are noticeable, especially with the use of names like Lorcan, O’Connell, and Cormac, which are Irish names also found in Maas’s works.

The plot was engaging, and the angst was well-executed, which kept me invested.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building felt lacking. While the author did express some history and backstory throughout the book, it felt incomplete. I hope the second book will expand on this, as more backstory on the FMC and the world’s history would make the story flow better. A prequel could also help fill in these gaps.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Character development was present, though it felt like a setup for more growth in the second book. I’m excited to see how the characters evolve further.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am eagerly anticipating the sequel. Graves, in particular, is a standout character—I’d say yes instantly if he asked me to be his pet or apprentice! I also need fan art of him ASAP.

The female main character is strong-willed and assertive, which I appreciated; it's refreshing to see a female lead who stands up for herself in a challenging world. However, I felt the romance between Graves and the female lead lacked depth in illustrating the development of their connection. By the end, their bond felt more instinctual than earned.",

However, the beginning felt disjointed due to the rapid shifts in action, though the pacing improved as the story progressed. The heist into the underworld and the background of the gods were fun elements.  \n\n- **Engagement and Connection:**  \n  Despite the fast-paced plot, I had some difficulty fully connecting with the characters and getting immersed in the story.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m curious about where the plot is heading, especially regarding Lorcan’s role in the next book. While the ending hinted at a reunion of characters, I hope the second book has its own unique feel and doesn’t repeat the same heist energy as the first.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had an engaging premise and strong action elements, but it struggled with character depth and initial pacing.

If you're not into those, they didn't detract from the storyline and were appropriate for the character development.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Kierce's (spelling uncertain, as I listened to the audiobook) character, her drive, and her love for her \"family.\" Kierce is a human living in a post-human-monster war era where humans are aware monsters exist and have taken over New York City.

However, it wasn’t my favorite in the genre, as authors like Maas and Broadbent are tough to beat.  \n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - The strong female main character (FMC) was a highlight.  \n  - The setting of NYC with a fantasy overlay was intriguing and well-executed.  \n  - The story/plot was fun and moved at a good pace throughout.  \n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - The story felt too reminiscent of *Throne of Glass* (e.g., the thief guild, the terrible mentor). While fantasy novels often borrow ideas, this felt too on the nose.  \n  - The romance aspect didn’t stand out to me. For example, a particular moment where the MMC says, “we don’t have to-“ and the FMC responds, “shh…I want this,” felt clichéd and underwhelming.  \n\n- **Future Interest:**  \n  - Despite my gripes, I would still read future books in the series. It was a fun enough read, and I’m curious to see what happens next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this romantasy novel had its strengths, such as a strong FMC, an engaging setting, and a well-paced plot, it fell short in originality and romance execution.

It included forced proximity, a tortured hero, found family, a badass female main character (FMC), an age gap, Celtic mythology and lore, and a heist plot.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The world-building was unique, and I loved the NYC setting with dystopian vibes. The concept of monsters and humans coexisting alongside one another was intriguing.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The love story aspect fell a bit flat for me because it felt predictable, and parts of their relationship seemed rushed. Their dynamic played out similarly to many other romantasy couples, and I wished for something that made them stand apart.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  I didn’t expect the ending (which I won’t spoil), but it left me excited to see where the story will go in book two!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was an engaging and unique retelling with a fascinating world and a mix of thrilling elements. While the romance felt predictable and rushed at times, the story’s darker tone, creative world-building, and unexpected ending left me eager for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the plot intrigued me (it vaguely reminded me of Stephen King’s *Fairy Tale*, which I loved), and I decided to give it a try, especially since there was a Kindle deal.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The first part of the book felt really slow and boring to me, so much so that I struggled to keep going. However, around the halfway point, the story takes a sharp turn and becomes much more engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are overall well-defined and vibrant.  \n\n- **Ending and Overall Satisfaction:**  \n  I really liked the ending because it wasn’t predictable at all, as one might expect. In fact, it left me wanting to know more. I’ll probably give the second installment a chance when it comes out. (Here’s hoping for a better translation!)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started off slow and unengaging, it picked up significantly in the second half, with well-developed characters and an unpredictable, satisfying ending. Despite not being a fan of the fantasy genre, I enjoyed it enough to consider reading the sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 ⭐️"

            "My main concern with this book was the excessive use of names that evoke Sarah J. Maas's works. While I recognize that these are authentic Irish names for Irish characters (e.g., Lorcan, Declan, Flynn, Brannon, Cormac, Ethan/Ithan), their prevalence made it difficult to separate this story from SJM's universe. If the naming had been more varied, I believe this book could have easily earned a 4-star rating from me.",

It follows a human girl skilled in thievery who is hired for a perilous job by a mysterious man after being caught breaking into his home. The narrative is rich with various monsters and intricately weaves Celtic mythology into an engaging adventure, making me fall in love with the main characters."

The story is laden with monsters of all kinds and weaves Celtic mythology into a dystopian adventure that captivated me and left me falling for the main characters.  \n\n- **Characterization and Names:**  \n  My only issue with this book was the overabundance of names reminiscent of SJM (Sarah J. Maas) novels. While I understand that they are Irish names for Irish characters (e.g., Lorcan, Declan, Flynn, Brannon, Cormac, Ethan/Ithan), it felt like there could have been other names used to avoid the constant reminder of SJM’s characters. Without this distraction, the book would have easily been a 4-star read for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating dystopian adventure with a unique premise and engaging characters. The incorporation of Celtic mythology added depth to the story, though the similarity of character names to those in SJM’s works was a minor drawback.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars (rounded up from 3.5)."

The narrative centers on a heist gone awry, with Kierse striking a deal with the monster of the library she attempted to infiltrate.

Filled with action, tension, and conflict, the unlikely partnership between the protagonist and Graves—formed when she accidentally enters his home, a punishable offense under the human-monster pact—drives the plot forward. Their mission to steal a legendary object heightens the stakes and excitement.

It’s clear that the author put a lot of effort into crafting every detail. The story is set in a world where monsters and humans coexist, and the history is very well-developed.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  Kierse finds herself in a situation where she has to live and work with a man named Graves to complete a mission. He is responsible for training her, and initially, both are very closed off. While they don’t hate each other, they aren’t exactly comfortable around one another.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance feels forced and comes out of nowhere. Kierse suddenly wakes up one day and falls in love with Graves simply because she finds him attractive. There are no meaningful interactions or scenes that show why they become so obsessed with each other. It feels like the plot demands they be together.  \n\n- **Subplots:**  \n  The subplot involving Kierse’s ex is unnecessary. I generally dislike when ex-partners of protagonists are introduced, but in this case, it added nothing to the story and felt completely irrelevant.  \n\n- **Predictability and Originality:**  \n  Many of the events in the book are predictable. It feels like the author relied on overused tropes and situations that are known to please the audience. While some elements felt unoriginal, the ending was well-executed. The twist that Kierse is a will-o’-the-wisp was very interesting and left me eager to read the second book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book is engaging, and the premise is fresh compared to recent novels. However, the execution didn’t fully convince me. Despite its flaws, the story has a lot of potential, and I plan to continue reading the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75 ⭐️"

It seemed as though the story hadn’t been carefully planned or arranged. However, around the time of The Winter Solstice, the prose improved significantly, becoming more polished and compelling, which made me more eager to continue reading.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters didn’t interact in a way that felt authentic or natural. There was a noticeable lack of genuine chemistry between Graves and Wren, though this might have been intentional given the later revelations in the story. Additionally, the characters lacked an aura of innocence, making it difficult to view them as trustworthy or sincere.  \n\n- **Plot/Storyline:**  \n  The narrative took time to find its footing, but it began to take shape more clearly around The Winter Solstice. The final 60 to 100 pages were particularly engaging, leaving me intrigued and eager to see what happens next in the series.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was a strong point of the novel. It rekindled my hope for the story and left me genuinely excited for the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had a rocky start with disjointed writing and underdeveloped character dynamics, it improved significantly as the story progressed. The final portion of the book was particularly compelling, leaving me eager for the next installment. Despite its flaws, the novel managed to capture my interest by the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Characters: ★★☆☆☆  \n- Character Development: ★★☆☆☆  \n- Spice Level: ★★★☆☆  \n- Plot/Storyline: ★★★☆☆  \n- Ending: ★★★★☆  \n- Writing: ★★☆☆☆  \n\n**What Would I Read Next from This Author:**  \nI’m ready for the next installment!

            "The male protagonist is a morally ambiguous villain, characterized by a large ego and exaggerated traits. In contrast, the female lead is a snarky, almost archetypal magical figure—immensely powerful, stunningly beautiful, and universally sought after. She relies on her unique, previously unknown powers to save herself. The centuries-old male character finds himself captivated by her in a way he has never experienced before. However, a notable critique is that the female protagonist could have been more relatable; a more ordinary appearance, perhaps a bit overweight, intelligent, practical in her footwear, and breaking curses through knowledge rather than innate abilities would have added depth to her character.",

            "The first half of the novel was engaging and intriguing, filled with a complex plot and numerous characters. However, this abundance sometimes felt overwhelming. As the story progressed, it began to drag, leading to moments of boredom halfway through.",
            "The male main character exudes Rhysand vibes from *ACOTAR*, and I thoroughly enjoyed his scenes. The female main character, reminiscent of Violet from *Fourth Wing*, is young and a bit whiny, yet believes she’s tough and badass. If you appreciate her character, you’ll likely enjoy this story. The friend group and the werewolves who protect her are endearing, and I would have loved to see more focus on them.",
            "The writing showcased moments of brilliance but also felt immature at times. The excessive use of curse words as filler was particularly annoying and distracting.",
            "The story evokes elements of *Beauty and the Beast* and shares similarities with the ACOTAR series, which I appreciated. The blend of a dystopian world filled with monsters and romantic fantasy elements was particularly enjoyable, especially for fans of the genre."

It had its strengths, such as the intriguing first half, the mmc’s Rhysand-like charm, and the sweet friend group. However, the immature writing style, overwhelming plot, and slightly excessive length held it back from being perfect. While I enjoyed it well enough, I’m not sure I’m interested enough to continue with the sequel.",

            "I appreciated how the plot built up to the ending, but I felt the female main character should have anticipated it. The male main character was almost too obvious in revealing that he was the Holly King and that Lorcan was the Oak King. While the pacing was occasionally uneven, this seems to be a recurring issue in recent fantasy novels, so I won't hold it against this one.",
            "One aspect of this book that I didn't appreciate was the tendency to withhold crucial information until the very end. Graves was aware of her trust issues, so he should have been upfront about his suspicions that she was a wisp. On a positive note, the romance was enjoyable. While I would have liked to see more buildup and tension, I found the progression of their relationship to be believable overall.",

The MMC was practically spoon-feeding to her that he was the Holly King and that Lorcan was the Oak King.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Trust Issues:**  \n  One trope in this book that I'm not a fan of is the whole hiding important information until the last moment. Graves knew she had trust issues, so instead of hiding his suspicions, he should have been outright that he thought she was a wisp.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  I do really like the dialogue and how the story was written.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a bit wishy-washy at times, but that's been a common theme in fantasy books lately, so I'm not going to hold it against this one.  \n\n- **Action Scenes:**  \n  The fight scene against King Louis could have been drawn out more. It ended way quicker than I would have liked.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was nice too. There could have been more lead-up and more tension, but other than that, I found the progress of their relationship believable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book and am excited for the next one to come out.

I hope these aspects, along with Kierse's origins, are explored in future books; after all, we all love a good origin story. If it were up to me, this would be a villain origin story, but Kierse shows a level of tolerance for nonsense that I certainly wouldn't. The romance was well-integrated into the narrative, and the smut never felt like a mere plot device.",
            "My favorite aspect of this story is the worldbuilding. The immersive experience plunges you in headfirst, yet it feels coherent. The author clearly conducted thorough research on New York while also crafting a unique version of the city. I could vividly envision a New York ravaged by years of conflict and poverty.",

That said, I find this common in many romance novels, as romantic themes can be hard to tackle without some level of cringe. The comparison to *Twilight* is valid in terms of romantic dynamics (e.g., two guys vying for the protagonist), but I found the approach in this book more appealing and fitting for the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  This is a light-hearted romantasy with some dark themes, making it a great option for fans of *Ninth House* who are looking for something less intense but still engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite a few minor criticisms.

            "The story swiftly transitions from its premise to action, but this rapid pace often feels nonsensical. While entertaining, the plot lacks coherence, and the protagonist's motivations come across as overly complicated; a simpler approach would have been more effective. The novel feels as though it could have been divided into three separate books, as it crams in too much content for one volume. Although nothing feels restrained, the story's density would have benefited from a more expansive treatment.",
            "I have questions about the main protagonist, especially regarding her motivations as a thief. Is her thievery solely for survival, or is there a deeper reason behind it? Furthermore, the sudden appearance of gifts in characters who previously lacked them feels unexplained and somewhat jarring.",

Its aesthetic appeal, accessibility on Kindle Unlimited, and engaging plot make it a solid recommendation for a quick, entertaining read, though it’s best suited for older teens and adults due to its mature content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice Level: 1 pepper  \n- Content Rating: PG-13"

At times, it felt like I was reading a fanfic rather than an original work. The writing relies heavily on dialogue, with not enough internal thoughts or descriptions to fully immerse me in the fictional world.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters lacked depth, and I didn’t feel a strong connection or sympathy for any of them. The story didn’t dive deep enough into their personalities or motivations, which made it harder to engage with them emotionally.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  The pacing was such that I was okay with putting the book down and not feeling compelled to finish it in one sitting. It didn’t keep me hooked or make me lose sleep over wanting to know what happens next.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The bones of the story are good, but it’s missing small details that could make the world feel more vibrant and alive. The lack of descriptive elements made it harder to fully absorb and visualize the setting.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I would recommend this book for light fantasy reading. It’s enjoyable for what it is, but don’t expect a deeply immersive or emotionally gripping experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has potential and offers a light, enjoyable fantasy read, it falls short in character development, world-building, and emotional engagement.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  The novel is a new adult romantasy with a dystopian future setting. It features a mix of romance, fantasy, and action, with a backdrop of a post-war world where monsters and humans are trying to rebuild.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story follows Kierse, a thief who gets caught and is then hired for a dangerous, secretive job by her boss, Graves. The plot involves many small events leading up to a climactic ending. However, the pacing felt uneven, with a lot happening toward the end.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Kierse and Graves have a classic enemies-to-lovers dynamic. Graves is initially portrayed as mean but reveals a softer side, and their mutual attraction is a central focus. The characters are engaging, though Graves keeps many secrets, adding tension to their relationship.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The dystopian future is intriguing, with a history of war between monsters and humans. The world-building is solid, though it doesn’t delve too deeply into the details of this post-war society.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narrator did an excellent job, enhancing the overall experience of the story.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  This is the first book in a series, but I’m unsure if I’ll continue with the rest of the installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a decent entry into the new adult romantasy genre, with an engaging enemies-to-lovers dynamic and an intriguing dystopian setting. While the pacing felt uneven and the ending was packed with action, the audiobook narration elevated the experience. However, the series potential is uncertain for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up."

While I enjoyed it immensely, I hope the sequel delivers more banter, romance, and backstory to deepen the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The cliffhanger ending was intriguing and sparked a theory about the intentional chemistry issues in Book 1, leaving me eager to see where the plot leads in the next installment. The premise captivated me: a recluse with a magical library makes a deal with Kierse, who then spends several weeks living and training with him to execute a high-stakes heist in the city's dark, crime-ridden underbelly. The heist plot was engaging, and I found myself thoroughly invested in discovering more about Kierse’s magic.",

However, the chemistry between the two main characters feels underdeveloped, lacking sufficient on-page interactions to establish a meaningful connection, whether romantic or lustful. I would have appreciated more development in this aspect.",

However, sometimes that slowness is needed to build the story effectively.  \n\n- **Moral Complexity:**  \n  I appreciated that there was no clear villain or hero in the story. This lack of black-and-white morality was refreshing and added depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Anticipation for Future Installments:**  \n  I am definitely looking forward to the next book. 🥰  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel despite its occasional slow pacing. The well-developed characters, moral complexity, and engaging storytelling left me eager for more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

Mind-blowing!)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was highly engaging and kept me hooked throughout, especially with its thrilling final quarter.

The ending, though, was absolutely stunning and left a lasting impression.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly stated, but the reviewer implies a rating below 5 stars due to the underdeveloped relationship."

While the chemistry between the main characters could have been improved, the story becomes increasingly engaging as it progresses, making it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Plot (4/5):**  \n  The novel revolves around Kierse, a thief hired to steal a ring from an elusive monster named Graves. When she gets caught, Graves offers her a new contract to steal a magical spear instead. This sets off a journey of self-discovery for Kierse as she uncovers her own magical abilities. The plot is engaging, with plenty of intrigue and an open-ended conclusion that leaves room for future developments, including a potential love triangle. The slow-burn romance and the unique magic system add depth to the story.\n\n- **Characters (4/5):**  \n  The characters are well-developed, with a strong female protagonist (FMC) in Kierse and a broody, grumpy male protagonist (MMC) in Graves. Their banter is enjoyable, and their dynamic adds a fun layer to the story. Kierse’s journey of self-discovery and her growing awareness of her magical abilities make her a compelling character. Graves’ mysterious nature and his role in Kierse’s transformation add intrigue to the narrative.\n\n- **Spice Level (2/5):**  \n  The romance is a slow burn, with minimal spice. The focus is more on the emotional and intellectual connection between the characters rather than physical intimacy. This may appeal to readers who prefer a more subdued romantic element.\n\n- **World-Building and Magic System:**  \n  The novel features a unique magic system that is intricately tied to the plot and characters. The inclusion of Celtic mythology adds a rich layer to the world-building, making the setting feel immersive and well-thought-out. The magical elements, such as the spear and the ring, are central to the story and contribute to the overall intrigue.\n\n- **Themes and Genre:**  \n  The book blends urban fantasy, romance, and elements of Celtic mythology. Themes of self-discovery, magic, and theft are prominent. The story also explores the idea of “he falls first,” adding a romantic twist to the narrative. The slow-burn romance and the open-ended conclusion leave room for future adventures and character development.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend this book to fans of urban fantasy, Celtic mythology, and unique magic systems. Readers who enjoy strong female protagonists, slow-burn romances, and stories with open-ended conclusions will likely find this novel captivating. The promise of a sequel adds to the excitement, as there is much more to explore in this world.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel delivers a captivating blend of urban fantasy, romance, and Celtic mythology, with a strong female protagonist and a unique magic system. The slow-burn romance, intriguing plot, and well-developed characters make it a compelling read. While the spice level is low, the emotional and intellectual connection between the characters more than makes up for it. The open-ended conclusion leaves room for future adventures, and I’m eagerly anticipating the sequel.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Plot: 4/5  \n- Characters: 4/5  \n- Spice Level: 2/5  \n- Overall Recommendation: Highly recommended for fans of urban fantasy and Celtic mythology."

The romantic elements are underwhelming, but the dynamic between Kierse and her chosen family stands out. Despite its flaws, the story held my interest enough to want to continue with the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.8⭐️ (Overall Rating)  \n2.5🌶 (Spice Level)"

I think I would have enjoyed the story more in print and may revisit it that way before the second book releases.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel has a fascinating premise and strong central characters, particularly the evolving relationship between Kierse and Graves.

I just hope it won't turn into a love triangle.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book started with a strong and captivating dedication, drawing me in immediately. While the initial excitement and investment in the relationship development were high, the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. Despite this, the main character's realistic reactions were a refreshing change from typical clichés, though there were moments that felt overly familiar. My curiosity will likely lead me to read the next installment, but I hope it avoids the pitfalls of a love triangle.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story was enjoyable overall, but the ending felt overly convenient. The final chapters were chaotic, cramming too much into a short timeframe. While this may have been a deliberate choice to pave the way for a sequel, it resulted in some events feeling rushed.",
            "The male main character (MMC) frequently concealed information from the female main character (FMC), which was quite frustrating. Given his portrayal as experienced and wise, his actions felt unrealistic, as he should have known better. However, both characters being bisexual added depth to their personalities and relationships.",

The tone and atmosphere evoke strong Holly Black vibes, and I’m curious to know if other readers share this impression."

Kierse, a skilled thief, inhabits a world haunted by monsters, where the Monster Treaty generally keeps order, though its limits are increasingly tested. Hired by one monster to steal from another, Kierse quickly finds herself in over her head. When the victim captures her, she must accept his terms to safeguard her friends. The narrative echoes *Beauty and the Beast*, as Kierse grapples with her deepening bond with Graves, the male lead.",
            "The story revolves around the male protagonist's motivations—whether he seeks to protect humanity or dominate it. Kierse, as a protector herself, often views Graves through a similar lens. However, her struggle to trust her judgment of him adds complexity to their relationship.",

However, its predictability diminished my overall enjoyment, leading me to rate it three stars. I did add an extra half-star for the inclusion of the Holly King/Oak King myth, which I personally love.",

It shares similarities with *Assistant to the Villain*, but with a more sensual twist. The story follows a familiar formula: a young, independent woman with unique skills strikes a deal with a powerful, dark man, and the arrangement soon becomes personal. If you enjoy this blend, you’ll find this book engaging."

If you enjoyed *Lore of the Wilds*, *The Cruel Prince*, or *A Court of Thorns and Roses*, you’ll likely enjoy this one too. It’s also similar to *Assistant to the Villain*, though much sexier. The story follows a familiar formula: a young, independent woman with unique skills, a deal with a powerful, dark man (both literally and figuratively), and the deal turning personal. If you like this recipe, you’ll enjoy this book.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  The novel is an absorbing read. Kierse, a talented thief, lives in a monster-haunted world where the Monster Treaty mostly maintains order, though the monsters are beginning to strain its boundaries. She is hired by one monster to steal from another, but the job turns out to be far from simple. When the robbed monster captures her, she’s forced to accept his terms to protect her friends. The story draws parallels to *Beauty and the Beast*, with Kierse navigating her growing connection to Graves, the male lead.\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Motivations:**  \n  The story hinges on the male main character’s motivations—whether he aims to protect humanity or rule it. Kierse, being a protector herself, tends to interpret Graves in a similar light. However, the question of whether she can trust her judgment of him adds depth to their dynamic.\n\n- **Writing Quality and Predictability:**  \n  The novel is well-written, especially compared to many romantasy books currently on the market. However, its predictability slightly detracted from my enjoyment, which is why I rated it three stars. I added an extra half-star for the inclusion of the Holly King/Oak King myth, which I personally adore.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you’re a fan of *Beauty and the Beast*-style stories, I recommend picking this one up. Your mileage may vary, but it’s a solid choice for romantasy readers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a well-written romantasy novel with a familiar yet engaging formula. While its predictability slightly lessened my enjoyment, the inclusion of the Holly King/Oak King myth and the strong character dynamics make it a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Grave’s transformation from a frosty monster to a smitten lover was abrupt and unconvincing, eliciting eye rolls at times.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The heist plot had potential for thrills but ultimately fell flat. The grand showdown with King Louis was underwhelming, and predictable twists, along with a past lover subplot, added little to the story. The pacing was uneven, and the narrative felt choppy, with some plot points needing more polish.  \n\n- **Writing and Editing:**  \n  Editing hiccups and a choppy narrative hindered the reading experience. The uneven pacing and lack of polish in certain areas detracted from the overall enjoyment of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n  The book explores themes of love, laughter, and life among liars, monsters, and murderers, emphasizing that there are no clear heroes or villains—just people blessed and cursed with magic. This line captures the vibe but doesn’t fully compensate for the book’s shortcomings.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Wren in the Holly Library* had a fantastic setup and a wealth of potential but ultimately fell short in execution. While the tropes and premise are appealing, the underdeveloped world-building, rushed romance, and uneven pacing made for a bumpy ride. Fans of the genre might still find it worth a read, but it didn’t quite hit the mark for me.  \n\n**Content Warnings:**  \n- Combat  \n- Violence  \n- Sex  \n- Drug and alcohol use  \n- Sex work  \n- Gang violence  \n- Abuse  \n- Genocide  \n- Colonization  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There were moments where too much happened in a single chapter, followed by long stretches (up to 10 chapters) where nothing significant occurred. This made the reading experience uneven and, at times, boring.  \n\n- **Engagement and Motivation to Read:**  \n  I stayed consistent with reading this book primarily because it was a buddy read. While I wasn’t planning to DNF (did not finish) it, I likely would have taken much longer to complete it without the motivation of reading alongside my friends.  \n\n- **Romantic Elements (Spice and Chemistry):**  \n  The romantic scenes were enjoyable, and I appreciated the spice. However, I struggled to fully grasp the connection between the main characters, Kierse and Graves. While I was invested during their heated moments, I felt no emotional pull during their mission-focused interactions.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics (Avoidance of Tropes):**  \n  I was relieved that there was no love triangle involving Lorcan, even though he was portrayed as a very appealing character. This decision helped keep the story focused and avoided unnecessary complications.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’m undecided about continuing the series. While I enjoyed certain aspects of the book, the pacing issues and lack of emotional depth in the main relationship make me hesitant to commit to future installments.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had a mixed experience with this book.

However, the author seems to have layered multiple worlds on top of each other, which made the story unnecessarily convoluted and confusing.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The MMC (male main character) is described as a supernatural human who is attractive from the start, but he lacks depth and simply \"exists\" in the story. The FMC (female main character) comes across as annoying and petulant, which made it hard to connect with her.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story feels scattered and goes all over the place, likely due to the complexity of the layered worlds. While it’s interesting enough to keep me engaged, it could have been more streamlined and might have worked better as a standalone novel rather than part of a series.  \n\n- **Marketing and Expectations:**  \n  The marketing for the book is misleading. It’s not a true \"beauty and the beast\" retelling, nor does it deliver on the \"enemies to lovers\" trope, as the characters are never really enemies. This disconnect between expectations and reality was disappointing.  \n\n- **Overall Engagement:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the story held my interest enough that I’m curious to see how it plays out in the second book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing premise and an interesting blend of dystopian and supernatural elements, it suffers from convoluted world-building, underdeveloped characters, and a scattered plot.

Entiendes la trama igual, pero es muy molesto porque falta armonía en el desarrollo.  \n  - Me ha gustado que el rey Luis muriese rápidamente y que no se haya alargado hasta el segundo libro.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - La elección de Ethan no me parece lógica.  \n  - El papel de Nate ha sido poco explotado.  \n  - Me ha gustado mucho la descripción psicoemocional de Kierse.  \n  - Espero que Gen tenga un gran protagonismo en la secuela porque tiene mucho potencial.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Interaction:**  \n  - Me ha gustado la calidad de la comunicación cuando Kierse volvió con Graves después de salvar a Ethan.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  - Los mejores momentos son cuando muere el rey Luis y cuando Kierse manda a la mierda a Graves y a Lorcan.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAunque la trama es comprensible, la falta de armonía en el desarrollo y ciertas decisiones poco lógicas afectan la experiencia. Sin embargo, la profundidad emocional de Kierse, algunos diálogos impactantes y momentos memorables resaltan como aspectos positivos. Hay expectativas para la secuela, especialmente en relación con el personaje de Gen.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.7/5"

The Underworld beneath Grand Central Station is richly described, filled with vivid imagery that made me reluctant to leave, despite its decay. This contrast likely stems from the fact that New York City is based on reality, while the Underworld is a product of the author's imagination, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring that unique creation.",

It felt unconvincing and didn’t add to the story in a meaningful way.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Works:**  \n  The book felt like a mix of *Crescent City* with sprinkles of *Twilight* and *True Blood*. This comparison made it feel less unique.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel had great elements, but they didn’t come together effectively. While some scenes and ideas were enjoyable, the rushed pacing, lack of tension, and unconvincing romance left me unsure of how to feel about the book overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.7/5"

Despite events like attacks, kidnappings, and a battle between powerful gods, everything was resolved too easily, with no lasting consequences.

At times, it was slow, and then suddenly, a lot happened all at once, which made the flow feel inconsistent.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  I really enjoyed the incorporation of Irish mythology. It added a unique and intriguing layer to the story that kept me engaged.  \n\n- **Potential for Future Books:**  \n  While this book had its flaws, I believe the second book in the series has the potential to be better. The foundation laid here gives me hope for improvement in the next installment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, my feelings about the novel are mixed. While I appreciated the Irish mythology and see potential for the series to improve, the pacing issues made the reading experience somewhat uneven.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

While some of the New York City-specific locations were unfamiliar to me, the overall sense of immersion in this transformed version of the city was strong and effective.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story is action-packed, featuring magic, heists, and high stakes. It kept me thoroughly entertained from start to finish.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The dynamic between Kierse and her friends, Ethan and Gen, creates a strong sense of found family. Their relationships add depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The story sets up intriguing possibilities for the series, and I’m eager to see where it goes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis dystopian urban fantasy offers a fresh and engaging take on *Beauty and the Beast*, with excellent world-building, a fast-paced plot, and compelling character dynamics. It’s an entertaining read that leaves me excited for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The heist plot, intended to be central, often feels rushed and takes a backseat, particularly during the climactic heist. Elements like Celtic lore and romance appear to be hastily introduced or resolved, giving the impression of being forgotten until the last moment. The story is predictable, especially concerning the characters' identities and roles. Overused tropes, such as the female main character overreacting to the male main character's withheld information for dramatic effect, detract from the narrative, reminiscent of *Iron Flame*.",

In contrast, Graves, the male lead, embodies the typical tall, dark, and brooding archetype. Unfortunately, the romance feels rushed and underdeveloped, relying on a few lines about his attractiveness to lend credibility. Additionally, the inclusion of a clichéd orgy party scene, where Kierse is pressured to dress provocatively, felt unnecessary and detracted from the story.",

Despite its flaws, I still recommend it with moderate expectations and hope the series improves in future installments.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5 stars)"

The characters, Kierse and Graves, are tragic and complex, with significant depth. I especially appreciated Graves' passion for reading. However, the romance felt forced; while I enjoy the morally grey hero trope embodied by Graves, his sudden transition from disliking Kierse to obsession felt abrupt and lacking explanation.

At times, the protagonist’s choices frustrated me—I'd find myself thinking, “Why is she being so foolish?” The plot generated considerable stress and confusion, prompting reactions like, “So much stress!” and “What is happening?” I was also surprised to discover that this story is part of a larger collection, which left me with mixed feelings."

There were a lot of plot points that I feel were too much for this story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential with its intriguing dystopian world and a well-developed character like Graves, it fell short due to an overstuffed plot, underdeveloped relationships, and a lackluster romance. The execution felt rushed and anti-climactic, leaving me disappointed and unlikely to continue the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 ⭐️ (rounded up on Goodreads)"

            "I struggled to connect with the characters. While Graves and Lorcan were entertaining, I hope a love triangle isn’t on the horizon—it seems likely. The side characters, particularly Kierse's friends and ex-girlfriend, felt like mere plot devices. The chemistry was underwhelming, and the sex scenes came off as somewhat silly, such as when she called him a god as he roared and climaxed simultaneously (though, to be fair, he was literally a god). On a positive note, I appreciated Graves' character design; he was enjoyable and fit my ideal of a bookish hero with his suits and midnight blue hair.",
            "The unexpected appearances of fae were delightful, and I appreciated the incorporation of Celtic folklore. However, the world-building occasionally felt silly. I struggled to take the term \"Monsters\" for non-humans seriously—it was reminiscent of scheduling an appointment with \"Doctor Monster.\"",
            "I often found my attention drifting, which may have been due to my choice to listen to the audiobook. The plot felt somewhat thin and contrived, making it difficult to stay fully engaged."

The plot seemed a little thin and contrived, making it harder to stay fully engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development and Connection:**  \n  I couldn't really connect with the characters. Graves and Lorcan were fun enough, though I hope a love triangle isn't being set up—it feels inevitable. The side characters, especially Kierse's friends and ex-girlfriend, felt like empty puppets being moved around the plot.  \n\n- **Chemistry and Romance:**  \n  The chemistry wasn't spectacular. The sex scenes were a bit goofy, like when she called him a god as he roared and climaxed simultaneously (though, to be fair, he was literally a god).  \n\n- **Character Design and Appeal:**  \n  I did like Graves' character design. He was very enjoyable and very much my kind of book man with his suits and midnight blue hair.  \n\n- **World-Building and Folklore Elements:**  \n  The surprise sprinklings of fae were nice, and I enjoyed the Celtic folklore elements. However, the world-building felt goofy at times. I could never take the term \"Monsters\" for non-humans seriously—it felt like having a \"Doctor Monster's appointment with Doctor Monster.\"  \n\n- **Potential and Series Interest:**  \n  Despite its flaws, dystopian urban fantasy has so much potential. I do hope to continue with the series and am hyped to see how the British and Irish elements play out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the book was mostly a fun time, though it had its share of flaws, including thin plotting, underdeveloped characters, and goofy world-building.

It lacks the depth and polish expected from a seasoned author, reading more like a rough draft than a finished work. While swearing can be effective in dialogue, as seen in Stephen Graham Jones' writing, here it feels gratuitous. The book also misses the illuminating word choices found in Patricia Briggs' works and the raw, feral energy characteristic of Laurell K. Hamilton's stories.",

Set in a post-war, modern New York City where monsters and humans coexist—albeit not always peacefully—the story's premise is intriguing, blending enemies-to-lovers, slow burn, and morally grey characters.

Although the side characters were intriguing, I found myself wanting more depth and backstory for some of them. The interludes at the end of each section, offering alternate perspectives, were a standout feature that enriched the narrative. I also appreciated the inclusion of LGB-positive relationships. The age gap between the MMC (over 500 years) and FMC (25) introduced an intriguing dynamic to the story.",

I bought it primarily because of the pretty cover and painted edges, and I was okay with the book itself not being great.  \n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  It’s very much a romantasy novel, sticking closely to the typical romantasy blueprint, but set in an urban fantasy environment.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main characters fit the usual tropes: a big, super powerful, and special magical love interest, and a spunky, \"strong\" heroine who doesn’t care about her looks but is actually gorgeous. The side characters, unfortunately, felt very much like side characters, and there was more potential for their development.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was entertaining, though chaotic, with a nice wrap-up at the end. However, the addition of an extra bit to hint at future books in the series felt unnecessary. It seemed like a way to emphasize how special the main characters are, which I found a bit overdone.  \n\n- **Ending and Series Potential:**  \n  I would’ve been happier if the book had ended after the main characters accomplished their goal and got the thing they wanted to steal. I’m unsure if I’ll read the next book in the series because I fear it might be drawn out over multiple books. I’d probably read one more, maybe two, but not six.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the book despite its predictable tropes and chaotic plot. The ending was satisfying, but the setup for future books felt unnecessary. While I might consider reading one or two more books in the series, I’m hesitant about committing to a long, drawn-out storyline.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The concept of Kierse, a gifted thief, being caught by a monster (Graves) and entering into a bargain with him was engaging and set up an interesting dynamic.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Kierse was an entertaining protagonist, but Graves felt a bit dry and lacked depth. The romance between them felt abrupt, with little prior development to justify the sudden intensity of their feelings.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was uneven—super slow in some parts and rushed at the end. There was a lot of info-dumping toward the conclusion, which would have been more effective if spread throughout the story.  \n\n- **Audio Narration (if applicable):**  \n  The audio narrator's portrayal of Graves was frustrating. Even at 2x speed, his voice sounded unnaturally slow, which detracted from the listening experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed \"The Wren in the Holly Library\" for its premise and Kierse's character, the uneven pacing, abrupt romance, and dry portrayal of Graves kept me from fully loving it. Despite these flaws, I’m curious enough to consider picking up the second book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars."

The story was engaging enough to finish, and the ending left me open to continuing the series, but improvements in originality and character development would elevate the experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Spice: 1/5"

I felt there was no initial chemistry between the main characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Dialogue:**  \n  The writing felt a little unpolished, especially as I progressed further into the book. Some of the dialogue seemed like it was written as a parody of the character type rather than embodying the actual character.  \n\n- **Physical Presentation:**  \n  The physical book itself is very pretty, which added to the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book started strong with a promising opening and impressive world-building, but the story lacked cohesion and compelling elements as it progressed. The romance fell flat due to a lack of chemistry between the main characters, and the writing style, particularly the dialogue, felt unpolished and at times parodic. Despite these flaws, the physical presentation of the book was visually appealing.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

It had the potential to be a compelling enemies-to-lovers arc, but instead, it felt cringeworthy and unnatural when they suddenly kissed without proper buildup.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution:**  \n  The final climax and resolution felt rushed. The main antagonist was defeated and the stolen lance recovered in just a few pages, which felt odd after the entire book built up to it. The revelations that followed were also crammed into a few pages, leaving me wishing for more depth and exploration.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was entertaining and had some enjoyable elements, such as the magic system and character friendships, it fell short in its execution of the romance subplot and the rushed resolution of the main conflict. I would have appreciated more depth and development in these areas.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 ⭐️"

I really wanted to like it, but it ended up being just okay for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Wren in the Holly Library* has an imaginative premise and a compelling protagonist, its pacing issues, underdeveloped magic system, and lackluster climax prevent it from reaching its full potential. It’s a decent read but falls short of being truly gripping.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

Perhaps this is because there’s another book where the story continues, but I missed having a bit more romance between them.  \n\n- **Ending and Continuity:**  \n  The ending felt too open-ended for my taste, but it does leave clear clues about how the next book will begin.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the open ending and the romance feeling secondary, I still recommend the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It didn’t receive the attention it deserved.  \n\n- **Romance Focus:**  \n  The romance seemed to dominate the story, but it felt more like filler or a distraction rather than a meaningful addition. It took away from the main plot, which was already fairly simplistic.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Engagement:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I still found the book to be a fun read. I enjoyed it overall, particularly because of my interest in Celtic myth and lore, which was a nice touch.  \n\n- **Sequel Potential:**  \n  The story sets up a good foundation for a sequel, and it feels like it’s part of a trilogy, which I’m fine with.  \n\n- **Romance Tropes:**  \n  I’m tired of the overused “shadow daddies” trope in romances—dark, edgy, and mysterious characters. I’d prefer more romances with “rays of sunshine” lovers instead.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had its shortcomings, such as underdeveloped friendships and an overly simplistic plot overshadowed by romance, it was still an enjoyable read.

The actual heist took forever to happen, which made the story feel unnecessarily drawn out.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**  \n  I was recommended this book as a romance fantasy, but the romance was almost nonexistent. There were only about two romantic scenes in the entire book, and they were very brief. This was disappointing, as I was expecting more focus on the romantic aspect.\n\n- **Plot Focus:**  \n  The majority of the book revolved around planning the heist, which became repetitive and tedious. The lack of action or significant developments during this portion made the story feel stagnant.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first half of the novel was enjoyable, the second half suffered from poor pacing and a lack of engaging content. The romance was underwhelming, and the overemphasis on heist planning made the story feel unnecessarily prolonged. Overall, it was a mixed experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It progressed too quickly, going from 0 to 60 in an unnatural way, which made it seem forced. I believe it would have been more compelling as a slow burn, potentially explored in a future book, rather than being rushed in this one.  \n\n- **Pacing and Focus:**  \n  I think the emphasis of this book should have remained on the heist and the discovery of all the major players. The inclusion of Torra in the romance subplot felt unnecessary and added to the clunkiness of the narrative. Her presence didn’t enhance the story and could have been omitted without any loss to the overall plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the novel’s integration of Norse mythology and history, the rushed and forced romance subplot detracted from the story’s potential.

However, the rushed romance, awkward dialogue, and third-person perspective left room for improvement. While it was an enjoyable read overall, it didn’t fully meet my expectations.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

This has left me uncertain about continuing the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nI would have given this a five-star rating, but due to the disappointing ending, my final rating is lower.

They felt flat and unrelatable, which made it difficult for me to connect with the story.  \n\n- **World-Building and Naming Choices:**  \n  The name Lorcan is sacred and should not be used for characters outside of the SJM (Sarah J. Maas) universe. This choice felt jarring and took me out of the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel really fell flat for me. Despite my initial interest, I found myself disengaged and uninterested in the plot and its execution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, it failed to captivate me due to its lack of compelling characters and questionable naming choices.

I was just so bored, which made it hard for me to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Pacing and Enjoyment:**  \n  I usually give a book 100 pages, and if I’m still bored after that, I stop reading. In this case, I made it to 135 pages but ultimately decided to DNF (did not finish) because I wasn’t enjoying it.  \n\n- **Personal Suitability:**  \n  I don’t think this is a bad book, but it’s just not for me. I can see some people loving it, but it didn’t resonate with me personally.  \n\n- **Fairness in Evaluation:**  \n  I gave it two stars because I feel like my lack of enjoyment is more of a “me issue” rather than a reflection of the book’s quality.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book may not have been a good fit for me, I acknowledge that it could appeal to others. My decision to stop reading was based on my inability to connect with the story or characters, but I don’t consider the book itself to be poorly written or unworthy of attention.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2/5 stars."

This lack of editorial attention does a disservice to the authors.  \n\n- **Comparisons to Other Authors:**  \n  Comparing this book to works by powerhouse writers like V.E. Schwab and Leigh Bardugo was a poor decision, as their strengths in character development and storytelling far surpass what was achieved here.  \n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**  \n  I went into the book hoping for a well-developed fantasy story with strong romantic elements, but it failed to deliver on both fronts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its promising concept and potential, the novel fell short in execution, character development, and plot coherence.

His chemistry with Kierse is lacking, and I found her interactions with her ex-girlfriend far more compelling.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue, particularly Graves' attempts at being \"sexy,\" is awkward and laughable, almost making me quit the book entirely.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  This is another romantasy series that I don’t see myself continuing.

It felt like a missed opportunity to deliver something truly engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  None of the characters felt authentic. Their personalities seemed to shift inconsistently to fit the needs of each scene, which made it difficult to connect with or believe in them.  \n\n- **Publisher's Effort and Reputation:**  \n  I feel like Red Tower is capitalizing on the popularity of *Fourth Wing* without putting the same level of effort into their other books. This is the second time I've been disappointed by them, and I think I'll avoid their books in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book was underwhelming and failed to live up to its promising premise. The lack of authentic characters and the sense that the publisher is prioritizing trends over quality left me dissatisfied.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The concept of a bi4bi gangster dystopia romantasy is intriguing, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The idea of the protagonist's exes banding together to sabotage their life shows potential, yet the current narrative feels lacking in depth and cohesion.",
            "The MMC is a deeply flawed character who seems to create his own enemies, primarily among his exes. Despite his age, he consistently makes poor decisions and lacks redeeming qualities beyond his physical attractiveness. I find him unsympathetic and view him as the villain due to his manipulative behavior and refusal to take accountability. He is portrayed as tall, extremely handsome, scarred, tattooed, possessive, and burdened by a troubled past with a dead or abusive father. He has a peculiar pet name for the FMC, Wren, and is both a murderer and royalty, yet he lacks shadow magic and is not a secret assassin.\n\nThe FMC, on the other hand, is overly sexualized and somewhat incompetent. I find it puzzling that she dislikes museums, which seem like ideal settings for someone in her line of work (stealing valuables). Her personality comes across as overly cool and dismissive of art and history, which detracts from her character. Overall, the dynamics between these two characters leave much to be desired."

He is portrayed as someone who makes poor decisions despite his age and lacks redeeming qualities beyond his physical attractiveness. The reviewer finds him unsympathetic and labels him as the villain, criticizing his manipulative behavior and lack of accountability. His traits include being huge, extremely handsome, scarred/tattooed, possessive, and having a dead or abusive father. He also uses a weird pet name for the FMC (\"Wren\") and is a murderer and royalty. However, he lacks shadow magic and is not a secret assassin.\n\n- **Characterization of the FMC (Female Main Character):**  \n  The FMC is depicted as \"ultra horny\" and somewhat incompetent. The reviewer finds her dislike of museums baffling, as they seem like ideal places for someone in her line of work (stealing valuables). Her personality is criticized for being overly cool and dismissive of art and history.\n\n- **Plot and World-Building:**  \n  The reviewer finds the concept of a bi4bi gangster dystopia romantasy intriguing but feels the execution falls short. They suggest that a series where Graves's exes team up to ruin his life could have potential, indicating that the current story lacks depth or cohesion.\n\n- **Romantasy Tropes:**  \n  The reviewer humorously checks off common romantasy tropes present in the book, such as the MMC being huge, handsome, scarred/tattooed, possessive, and having a tragic backstory. However, they note the absence of shadow magic and a secret assassin trait, which they seem to find disappointing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the premise of a bi4bi gangster dystopia romantasy was highly anticipated, the execution left much to be desired.

Additionally, the incorporation of folklore was intriguing, though I remain uncertain about its fidelity to the original stories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has some strengths, particularly in its imagery and use of folklore, it struggles with a lack of focus, underdeveloped characters, and uneven pacing. These issues made the reading experience less engaging and ultimately unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n+1 star for the cool imagery and folklore ties."

For example, Kierse, the protagonist, is a thief (assassin) who is abused by her \"mentor,\" Jason (reminiscent of Arobynn). Additionally, the \"bad\" guy keeps secrets from her about her identity (similar to ACOTAR), and he is also 500 years old (reminiscent of Rhysand).\n\n- **Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n  The cover is gorgeous, and while my library copy didn't have the sprayed edges, I’ve seen that they are beautiful as well.\n\n- **Value for Money:**  \n  I’m glad I borrowed this book from the library and didn’t spend any money on it, as I didn’t feel it was worth purchasing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was engaging and had a visually appealing design, it lacked originality, drawing heavily from other popular fantasy works. Borrowing it was a better choice than buying it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

This similarity was distracting and felt unoriginal, especially since the dynamics between certain characters mirrored those in SJM's books. For example, Jason and Kierse's relationship closely resembled Arobynn and Aelin's, while Graves and Kierse's dynamic mirrored Rhys and Feyre's.  \n- **Use of Mythology:**  \n  The explanation for these similarities—ancient mythology—did not feel sufficient or convincing. It failed to justify the overt parallels and left me questioning the originality of the character dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had potential, the heavy reliance on character names and dynamics from SJM's works, coupled with an unconvincing mythological explanation, detracted from its overall quality. This issue overshadowed other aspects of the story and left me feeling disappointed.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 (originally considered, but lowered due to the issues mentioned)."

However, I found the entire story to be ridiculously cheesy, which made it difficult to enjoy. The tone and style of the writing did not resonate with me, and I really did not enjoy it at all.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The writing felt poor, with issues like plot holes and overly simplistic or clichéd phrases. For example, the line “like calls to like and power calls to power” in the first chapter set a tone that felt unoriginal and uninspired.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this book failed to engage me due to its cheesy tone, poor writing quality, and lack of originality. Despite my determination to finish it, I found the experience largely unenjoyable.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot:**  \n  - The plot was uninspired and terribly generic.  \n  - It felt excessively corny, especially with the resolution relying on the \"power of friendship.\"  \n  - The story lacked originality and depth, making it feel juvenile despite being marketed for adults.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - The characters were shallow and lacked depth.  \n  - The protagonist's thoughts and feelings, such as \"she never thought she would feel this way about him,\" felt forced and unrealistic.  \n  - There was a lack of meaningful character interactions to justify the emotional connections or developments.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - The writing was juvenile and repetitive, making it feel like a book for preteens rather than adults.  \n  - The language and tone were overly simplistic and at times cringe-worthy.  \n\n- **Villains:**  \n  - The villains were cartoonish and lacked complexity, making them uninteresting and unconvincing.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n  - The protagonist's magical ability (slowing time) was introduced in a way that felt contrived and poorly explained.  \n  - The story lacked internal consistency, with elements like the protagonist's surprise at her own magic feeling illogical.  \n\n- **Tone and Themes:**  \n  - The inclusion of NSFW scenes felt out of place in a story that otherwise read like a children's book.  \n  - The overall tone was inconsistent, oscillating between immature and unnecessarily mature themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn my opinion, this book was a disappointment. It failed to deliver a compelling plot, well-developed characters, or a coherent tone. The writing felt juvenile, the villains were one-dimensional, and the story relied on clichés and unrealistic emotional developments. Despite being marketed for adults, it read more like a poorly executed preteen novel with misplaced mature content.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It felt immature and not suited for a more sophisticated audience.  \n\n- **Story and Characters:**  \n  The story and characters seemed overly simplistic, as if they were written for a preteen reading level rather than a young adult audience.  \n\n- **Author's Potential:**  \n  I might consider giving the author another chance in the future if her writing style matures over time.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel felt too juvenile for my taste, with a writing style and narrative that seemed better suited for a younger audience. However, I remain open to revisiting the author’s work in the future if her style evolves.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I could never be a thief or stand my ground as long as this hot monster exists.\" It was like *Powerless* but worse?

This experience has made me question whether this genre is for me anymore.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a major disappointment for me.
