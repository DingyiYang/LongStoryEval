            "This book addresses challenging themes such as abuse, addiction, violence, and homelessness—real issues that many people confront. While the story bravely confronts these topics, the intensity of their concentration can be overwhelming at times. I highly recommend reviewing trigger warnings before diving in.",
            "To fully enjoy this book, I had to suspend my disbelief significantly, and I'm not sure I completely succeeded. The introduction of a miracle cure that claims to resolve complex issues like abuse, addiction, violence, and homelessness felt far-fetched—akin to suggesting a pill could cure cancer: hopeful but implausible. As someone who typically prefers romance and fantasy over thrillers, I may not be the ideal audience for this story. The grounded, real-world setting, which tackles heavy and traumatic themes, made it harder for me to connect compared to more fantastical narratives. However, despite my reservations, the mystery was compelling and kept me engaged. I found myself guessing until the end, only uncovering the twist a couple of chapters before the characters did. This unpredictability was a strong point of the book."

        "conclusion": "This book had its merits and kept me engaged, but some elements were challenging for me to fully embrace. The heavy themes, the far-fetched miracle cure, and the tonal shift toward the end made it a mixed experience. If you’re not as much of a realist as I am, you might find it more enjoyable. It’s far from a bad book, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.",

While I eventually managed to do so to some extent, I’m not entirely sure I succeeded. The introduction of a miracle cure that could supposedly solve complex real-world issues like abuse, addiction, violence, and homelessness felt far-fetched. It reminded me of suggesting a pill could cure cancer—hopeful but implausible.  \n\n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  I’m not typically a thriller or suspense reader; my preferences lean more toward romance and fantasy. While I’ve been exploring thrillers more lately, I might not be the ideal target audience for this kind of story. The grounded, real-world setting, dealing with heavy and traumatic issues, made it harder for me to connect compared to fantastical settings.  \n\n- **Themes and Content:**  \n  The book tackles difficult and heavy themes, including abuse, addiction, violence, and homelessness. These are real issues that many people face, and the story doesn’t shy away from them. However, the sheer concentration of these topics in one narrative felt overwhelming at times. I strongly recommend checking trigger warnings before reading.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  Around 70% into the book, I noticed a shift in tone that didn’t sit well with me. It began to feel like I was reading about a cult from the perspective of a devoted follower. This change disrupted my immersion and made the story harder to digest.  \n\n- **Mystery and Unpredictability:**  \n  Despite my reservations, the mystery was compelling and kept me hooked. I found myself guessing almost until the end, and I only figured out the twist a couple of chapters before the characters did. This unpredictability was a strong point of the book.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The touch of romance in the story was a welcome addition. As someone who enjoys romance, I appreciated this element, especially since I’ve read other books by this author and know she has a knack for it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book had its merits and kept me engaged, but some elements were challenging for me to fully embrace. The heavy themes, the far-fetched miracle cure, and the tonal shift toward the end made it a mixed experience. If you’re not as much of a realist as I am, you might find it more enjoyable. It’s far from a bad book, but it didn’t fully resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5⭐, 2🌶️"

There was also a trauma doctor who was supposedly helping but was actually killing people, and some drug-related element, but none of these elements were compelling or clearly explained.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters felt underdeveloped and lacked depth. The investigator, her fake partner, and the trauma doctor were introduced, but their motivations and personalities were not explored in a way that made me care about them or their actions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing was slow and monotonous, contributing to my lack of engagement. The story dragged, and the events felt disjointed, making it difficult to follow or stay invested.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel failed to captivate me. The plot was unclear and unengaging, the characters were underdeveloped, and the pacing was too slow to maintain my interest. I struggled to stay awake while reading and ultimately found the story forgettable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

While I understand that authors can incorporate life scenes into a well-written novel, the inclusion of such explicit content felt out of place and unnecessary.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book was a fine \"beach read,\" meaning it was easy to read and somewhat enjoyable. However, I don’t consider romances to be typical beach reads, and this book leaned more toward that tone than I expected.  \n\n- **Author's Future Works:**  \n  Based on this experience, I probably won’t read anything else by this author. The combination of mystery and romance, along with the graphic scenes, didn’t align with my preferences.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book was an easy read and could be considered a decent \"beach read,\" the inclusion of graphic sex scenes and the blending of mystery with romance didn’t meet my expectations for the genre. As a result, I’m unlikely to explore more works by this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I didn't care for it, and the book could've done without it.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  I was much more interested in the mystery surrounding the drug and murders. However, the landing didn't stick, and I was quite disappointed with the ending.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I was anticipating this book, and I've been enjoying Mia Sheridan's darker reads. Despite my initial excitement, I found myself unable to connect with the story as much as I had hoped.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I had high expectations for this book, particularly given my appreciation for Mia Sheridan's darker themes, I found the character development and romance unengaging. The mystery aspect held my interest, but the unsatisfying ending left me disappointed overall.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
