            "This novel offers insightful character studies, particularly of the Joseph family, who are depicted with both flaws and redeeming qualities. Marley, the central character, is a compelling figure who serves as the family's glue, though her ability to manage so much at a young age occasionally feels unrealistic. Mick, the stern and overbearing father, is a complex character grappling with the aftermath of war, while Elise, the stoic mother, plays a vital role in holding the family together until she can no longer do so. The three sons—Baylor, Waylon, and Shay—are distinct and well-developed, with Waylon’s love for Marley and Shay’s struggle for identity particularly noteworthy. Jade, Marley’s best friend, is a supportive and admirable presence, embodying the ideal friend. The Joseph family is deeply dysfunctional, yet their interactions are both shocking and touching, making for compelling reading.

It begins with a dead body discovered in a church attic, but the explanation unfolds slowly, taking up a substantial portion of the book (25-75%). The pacing is tedious, as the central mystery is often overshadowed by Marley's self-absorbed narrative.",

Her actions, such as pulling Shay Baby out of school to homeschool him without parental consent, and making decisions that exceed her role as a daughter-in-law, feel both intrusive and implausible. The Joseph family's challenges, including their large home, successful business, and community respect, are portrayed as trivial and fail to resonate as genuine struggles. Elise Joseph emerges as the true villain, enabling her husband and sons' dependency, while Marley unwittingly perpetuates this dysfunctional dynamic.",

The older generation perpetuates their toxic behaviors, resulting in deeply flawed and unlikable family dynamics.

            "The novel struggles to maintain tension, as each scene is saturated with heavy emotion, leading to a monotonous and melodramatic experience. The relentless attempts to heighten drama ultimately result in a deflating and tedious narrative, especially after the halfway point. It begins with a promising premise: a young woman moves to a small town in western Pennsylvania, becoming the focus of two brothers deeply entwined in their family's roofing business and their complex relationships with their parents. The story introduces elements of rivalry reminiscent of Cain and Abel, an Oedipal complex, and a King Lear-like dynamic with the father, which initially adds intrigue.",

            "The novel excels in its character studies, particularly of the Joseph family, who are depicted with both their flaws and redeeming qualities. Marley, the central character, is a compelling figure who serves as the glue holding the family together, though her ability to manage so much at a young age occasionally feels unrealistic. Mick, the stern and overbearing father, is a complex character grappling with the aftermath of war, while Elise, the stoic mother, plays a crucial role in maintaining family cohesion until she can no longer do so. The three sons—Baylor, Waylon, and Shay—are distinct and well-developed, with Shay emerging as particularly endearing. Jade, Marley’s best friend, stands out as a loyal companion, embodying the ideal of friendship. \n\nThe Joseph family is deeply dysfunctional, yet their interactions are both shocking and touching, making for compelling reading. Marley’s arrival in Mercury and her connection with the family reveal both their strengths and weaknesses over the course of eight years. Their struggles and moments of faltering feel realistic, evoking sympathy and frustration from the reader. The novel thoughtfully explores themes of loyalty, love, and the quest for belonging within a family.",

I had never read a B&N Book Club edition before, so I was hopeful it would be a good selection.\n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The story is set in Mercury, a town in Pittsburgh, and revolves around the Joseph family, who own a local roofing business. The narrative begins with a gruesome discovery in the attic of a church when the brothers are called to fix a leaky roof—they find a decomposed body. This raises questions about whether the story will be a mystery, a character-driven tale, or even a love story.\n\n- **Themes and Character Development:**  \n  The novel explores small-town life, imperfect and flawed family dynamics, and the complexities of belonging. The characters are engrossing and beautifully crafted, feeling very real. The story delves into the intricacies of relationships and the human desire for connection.\n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It may take some time to get into the story. Readers might wonder if the mystery will be solved or if solving it is even important. Similarly, they might question whether the love story is central to the plot. However, if you stick with it, the book becomes a semi-satisfying read.\n\n- **Suitability for Book Clubs:**  \n  The novel’s layered themes and well-developed characters make it a strong choice for book club discussions. I can see why it was selected for a book club edition.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a rich exploration of small-town life, family dynamics, and human connections, with beautifully crafted characters that feel authentic. While it may take some time to fully engage with the story, it ultimately provides a semi-satisfying read and is well-suited for book club discussions.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The frequent introduction of issues for every character ultimately detracted from the story's believability.",

At just 19, Marley exhibits a wisdom that seems unrealistic, constantly psychoanalyzing those around her. Her tendency to overstep boundaries with Shay and her self-appointed role as the family's savior are both frustrating and exaggerated. Most characters are unlikable, with the notable exception of Ruth, who sensibly opts to leave town for a more peaceful life.",

Neither pastor reflects the God of the Bible or guides their parishioners toward Him. The second pastor’s advice leans into moral relativism, which I found troubling. I would prefer Christianity to be left out of a story rather than portrayed inaccurately.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has strong writing, well-developed characters, and a moving ending, its slow pacing and lack of engagement made it a challenging read for me.

            "The novel aims to build tension through heavy emotional infusions in every scene, but this strategy ultimately backfires. Instead of generating suspense, it results in monotony and reader fatigue. By the halfway mark, the story feels deflated and tedious, failing to maintain engagement. The premise holds promise: a young woman moves to a small town in western Pennsylvania, becoming the center of a rivalry between two brothers. The narrative weaves themes of familial loyalty, Oedipal complexities, and a King Lear-like dynamic with their father. However, the plot is hindered by excessive melodrama and emotional intensity, which undermine its plausibility and pacing.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  The novel begins with a promising premise: a young woman moves into a small western Pennsylvania town and becomes the focal point of a rivalry between two brothers. The story intertwines elements of familial loyalty, Oedipal complexities, and a King Lear-like dynamic with their father. However, the plot becomes weighed down by excessive melodrama and emotional intensity, which detracts from its plausibility and pacing.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is often sharp and deft, showcasing the author's skill. However, it frequently becomes overly florid, with repetitive descriptions (e.g., listing things in threes) and dramatic, declarative statements that feel forced and heavy-handed. These stylistic choices, while initially striking, eventually overwhelm the narrative and make it feel contrived.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are deeply flawed and steeped in misery, which could have been compelling if not for their relentless self-absorption. They seem enamored with their own suffering and determined to spread it to others, making them difficult to empathize with. This lack of relatability and nuance diminishes the emotional impact of their struggles.  \n\n- **Pacing and Tension:**  \n  The novel attempts to build tension by infusing every scene with heavy emotion, but this approach backfires. Instead of creating suspense, it leads to a sense of monotony and exhaustion. By the halfway point, the story feels deflated and tedious, failing to maintain the reader's engagement.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Mercury* starts with an intriguing premise and demonstrates moments of strong writing, it ultimately falters under the weight of its melodrama and overwrought prose. The characters' unrelenting misery and the story's lack of plausibility make it a challenging and often tedious read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel excels in its character studies, particularly of the Joseph family, who are depicted with both their flaws and redeeming qualities. Marley, the central character, is a compelling figure who serves as the glue holding the family together, though her ability to manage so much at a young age occasionally feels unrealistic. Mick, the stern and overbearing father, is a complex character grappling with the aftermath of war, while Elise, the stoic mother, plays a crucial role in maintaining family cohesion until she can no longer do so. The three sons—Baylor, Waylon, and Shay—are distinct and well-developed, with Waylon’s love for Marley and Shay’s struggle with identity particularly noteworthy. Jade, Marley’s best friend, is a supportive and admirable presence, embodying the ideal friend. \n\nThe Joseph family is deeply dysfunctional, yet their interactions are both shocking and touching, making for compelling reading. Marley’s arrival in Mercury and her connection with the family reveal both their strengths and weaknesses over the course of eight years. Reactions to Marley vary; some fall in love with her, while others harbor dislike or even disdain. Ultimately, she becomes the best thing to happen to them.

I found myself getting mad at them, which is a sign of how well-crafted they are.  \n   - Marley, the protagonist, is particularly compelling.

            "The novel is a lengthy and arduous exploration of confusion. It begins with a dead body discovered in a church attic, yet the explanation unfolds slowly over a significant portion of the book, spanning 25-75%. The pacing is uneven, with excessive emphasis on Marley's personal drama at the expense of the central mystery.",
            "In this story, Marley, the protagonist, plays the role of an overly intrusive character who inserts herself into the lives of the Joseph family in an unrealistic manner. Her actions, such as homeschooling Shay Baby without parental consent and making decisions well beyond her responsibilities as a daughter-in-law, feel both overbearing and unbelievable. Furthermore, the serious issues facing the Joseph family are trivialized, raising doubts about their significance. Elise Joseph emerges as the true antagonist, enabling her husband and sons' dependency, while Marley inadvertently reinforces this dysfunctional dynamic.",
            "The novel's tone is excessively dramatic, with exaggerated reactions to minor conflicts—such as the patriarch's piano playing being depicted as monstrous. While it explores themes of codependency and overbearing behavior, these elements are presented in a way that feels unrealistic and frustrating.",

The protagonist, Marley, is intrusive and unrelatable, while the Joseph family's conflicts feel trivial and poorly developed. The central mystery is overshadowed by Marley's self-absorption, making the book a frustrating and disappointing read.",

            "The story is quite engaging, following the Joseph brothers, their mother Elise, and Marley, the wife of one of the brothers, as they navigate shifting family dynamics over the years. The opening chapter introduces a compelling mystery with the discovery of a corpse, suggesting the Josephs' involvement and adding depth to the narrative. While the plot has potential, a more streamlined script could enhance its appeal, making it well-suited for a slice-of-life show.",
            "The prose in *Mercury* is overly convoluted, creating an illusion of depth that makes for an exhausting reading experience. At times, I questioned my understanding of the text due to its excessive complexity. For example, on page 160, the passage describing \"three women cleaning\" and \"erasing skin and flesh and blood\" demonstrates this issue; it seems the author is striving for profundity, which ultimately detracts from the story's accessibility.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Language and Prose:**  \n  The prose in *Mercury* is unnecessarily convoluted, creating an illusion of depth that made the reading experience exhausting. At times, I questioned whether I could even understand it, as the language felt overly complex and, at times, meaningless. A specific example from page 160—\"A mighty act, three women cleaning. Erasing skin and flesh and blood, as if they knew inherently what it took to make something un-exist outside the walls of memory\"—highlighted this issue. It felt like the author was trying too hard to appear profound, which detracted from the story's accessibility.  \n\n- **Story and Plot:**  \n  The story itself wasn’t bad. It follows the Joseph brothers, Elise (the mother), and Marley (the wife of one of the brothers) over the years, exploring how family dynamics shift under various circumstances. The first chapter introduces a mystery with the discovery of a corpse, hinting at the Josephs' involvement, which added an intriguing layer to the narrative. The plot had potential, and with a more straightforward script, it could have been engaging, perhaps even suitable for a slice-of-life show.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  The difficult language made the book a challenging read, and I finished it feeling relieved it was over. While the story had elements I liked, the overly complex prose overshadowed its strengths, leaving me disappointed overall.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Mercury* has an interesting story and a compelling family dynamic at its core, the unnecessarily convoluted prose made it a difficult and exhausting read.

            "The book opened with great promise, captivating my interest initially, but unfortunately, it lost momentum as the story unfolded. The author overwhelmed the narrative with an excessive number of problems, which felt unrealistic and contrived. While I appreciate that life presents challenges, the sheer volume of issues seemed forced, as though the author was simply trying to include every possible conflict.",
            "The characters, especially Marley, tend to overthink to the point of annoyance. At just 19, Marley comes across as a wise old soul, constantly psychoanalyzing those around her. Her behavior often crosses boundaries, particularly with Shay, exemplified by her dramatic outburst at school, declaring him as \"her boy.\" This felt excessive and over-the-top. Most characters lacked likability, with the exception of Ruth, who wisely chose to leave town for a more peaceful life. While the book offers a detailed exploration of the Joseph family's dynamics and Marley's evolving role, her desire to be the family's savior feels unearned and intrusive, as no one asked her to assume that responsibility.",

            "The use of multiple perspectives offers a nuanced portrayal of the family's dysfunction and individual challenges. This shifting viewpoint enriches the story's realism and emotional depth.",
            "This novel presents excellent character studies, particularly of the Joseph family, who are depicted with both flaws and redeeming traits. Marley, the central character, is a compelling figure who helps hold the family together, though her ability to manage so much at a young age can feel somewhat unrealistic.

The three sons—Baylor, Waylon, and Shay—are well-developed, each boasting distinct personalities and struggles that inspire empathy. Jade, Marley’s best friend, shines as a loyal companion, embodying the ideal of friendship. Despite their deep dysfunction, the Joseph family's interactions are both shocking and touching, creating a gripping narrative.

            "The novel is a lengthy and arduous exploration of confusion. It begins with a dead body discovered in a church attic, but the explanation unfolds slowly, taking up a significant portion of the book (25-75%). The pacing is tedious, as the central mystery is frequently overshadowed by Marley's self-absorbed narrative.",
            "In this story, Marley, the protagonist, comes across as overly virtuous, intruding into the lives of the Joseph family in an unrealistic and intrusive manner. Her actions, such as homeschooling Shay Baby without parental consent and making significant decisions at Joseph & Son’s Roofing, feel exaggerated and boundary-crossing. The family's challenges, including their large home, successful business, and community respect, are portrayed as trivial, failing to resonate as genuine conflicts. Elise Joseph emerges as the true antagonist, enabling her husband and sons' dependency, while Marley inadvertently reinforces this dysfunctional dynamic.",
            "The tone of the story is critical and dismissive, as I found the narrative nauseating and excessively centered on Marley's self-absorbed perspective. The writing lacks emotional resonance and believability, especially regarding Marley's swift integration into the Joseph family and her implausible influence over them.",
            "The novel aims to delve into themes of family dysfunction and codependency but ultimately falls short in presenting compelling and relatable conflicts. The patriarch's supposedly monstrous behavior, such as questioning Marley about her father and playing Beethoven, comes across as exaggerated and unconvincing. Overall, the story lacks the depth needed to engage with its themes, leaving me feeling disconnected."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The novel *Mercury* is a disappointing read, characterized by a slow and tedious plot, underdeveloped characters, and unconvincing conflicts. The protagonist, Marley, comes across as overbearing and unrealistic, while the Joseph family's issues fail to resonate as meaningful or relatable. The story's attempt to explore themes of family dysfunction falls flat, leaving the reader unengaged and frustrated.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The novel is described as a \"long, slow, and painful journey through nonsense.\"  \n   - The story jumps through timelines, starting with a dead body found in a church attic, but the explanation for this event is dragged out over a significant portion of the book (25-75%).  \n   - The pacing feels tedious, with the central mystery often overshadowed by Marley's self-absorbed narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Marley, the protagonist, is portrayed as a \"goodie two shoes\" who inserts herself into the Joseph family's lives in an overbearing and unrealistic manner.  \n   - Her actions, such as homeschooling Shay Baby without parental consent and making major decisions at Joseph & Son’s Roofing, feel exaggerated and boundary-crossing.  \n   - The Joseph family's \"issues\" are dismissed as trivial, with their problems (e.g., a large home, successful business, community respect) not resonating as significant conflicts.  \n   - Elise Joseph is identified as the true villain, enabling her husband and sons' dependency, while Marley perpetuates this dysfunctional dynamic.  \n\n- **Themes and Conflict:**  \n   - The novel attempts to explore themes of family dysfunction and codependency but fails to present compelling or relatable conflicts.  \n   - The supposed \"monstrous\" behavior of the patriarch (e.g., asking Marley about her father and playing Beethoven) feels exaggerated and unconvincing.  \n   - The story lacks depth in addressing the complexities of its themes, leaving the reader unengaged.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n   - The tone is critical and dismissive, with the reviewer finding the narrative \"nauseating\" and overly focused on Marley's self-centered perspective.  \n   - The writing fails to create emotional resonance or believability, particularly in Marley's rapid integration into the Joseph family and her unrealistic influence over them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel *Mercury* is a disappointing read, characterized by a slow and tedious plot, underdeveloped characters, and unconvincing conflicts. The protagonist, Marley, comes across as overbearing and unrealistic, while the Joseph family's issues fail to resonate as meaningful or relatable. The story's attempt to explore themes of family dysfunction falls flat, leaving the reader unengaged and frustrated.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- The review does not explicitly provide a numerical rating, but the tone and critique suggest a low rating, likely 1 or 2 out of 5 stars."

I had never read a B&N Book Club edition before, so I was hopeful it would be a good selection.  \n\n- **Setting and Premise:**  \n  The story is set in Mercury, a town in Pittsburgh, and revolves around the Joseph family, who own a local roofing business. The narrative begins with a gruesome discovery in the attic of a church, where the brothers are called to fix a leaky roof and stumble upon a decomposed body.  \n\n- **Genre and Narrative Style:**  \n  The book blends elements of mystery, character-driven storytelling, and even a potential love story. It kept me wondering: Is this a \"who-dun-it\"? Or is it more about the characters and their relationships? Will the mystery be solved, or is it secondary to the exploration of the characters?  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters are engrossing, beautifully crafted, and feel incredibly real. The story delves into imperfect, flawed, and complex family dynamics, with a strong theme of belonging.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n  It took me a while to get into the story. I found myself questioning whether the mystery would be resolved or if it even needed to be. Similarly, I wondered if the love story was central to the plot. However, if you stick with it, the book becomes a semi-satisfying read.  \n\n- **Suitability for Book Clubs:**  \n  I can see why this would be a good book club selection. Its layered narrative and rich character exploration provide plenty of material for discussion.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a narrative about small-town life, with all its imperfections and complexities.

This made the reading experience interesting and distinct.  \n\n- **Pacing:**  \n   - The first half of the story was slow, which made it easy for me to get distracted. However, the second half held my interest much more effectively.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I liked most of the characters, but the entire cast was frustrating overall. Marley, in particular, stood out with her frustration toward the Joseph family’s inability to communicate honestly or address important issues.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - The small town of Mercury was vividly portrayed, and it was clear that neither the town nor the Joseph family was prepared for Marley and her mother’s arrival.  \n\n- **Plot Structure:**  \n   - The story begins in the present day, with Marley married to one Joseph brother, an ex to another, and acting as a surrogate mother to the entire family. It then shifts to her arrival and explores the dysfunctional dynamics of the Joseph family.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - Despite the dysfunction, there was beauty in the family’s relationships. The book left a lasting impression on me, largely because I didn’t always like or agree with the characters, which made the story powerful and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a compelling and memorable read, thanks to its unique style, complex characters, and exploration of dysfunctional family dynamics.

This excessive complexity diminished the story's realism, as the constant influx of issues for each character detracted from its believability.",

Jade, Marley’s best friend, stands out as the loyal and supportive companion everyone wishes for. The Joseph family is undeniably dysfunctional, engaging readers with their shocking and poignant interactions. Marley’s arrival in Mercury uncovers both the family's virtues and vices over an eight-year span.

            "The novel is a lengthy and arduous exploration of confusion. It begins with a dead body discovered in a church attic, but the explanation for this event is unnecessarily prolonged, taking up a substantial portion of the book (25-75%). The pacing is tedious, as the central mystery is overshadowed by Marley's self-absorbed narrative.",
            "In this story, Marley, the protagonist, is an overly intrusive character who inserts herself into the lives of the Joseph family in an unrealistic way. Her actions, such as homeschooling Shay Baby without parental consent and making decisions that exceed her role as a daughter-in-law, feel both intrusive and implausible. The Joseph family's challenges, including their large home, successful business, and community respect, are portrayed as trivial and fail to resonate as genuine struggles. Elise Joseph emerges as the true villain, enabling her husband and sons' dependency, while Marley unwittingly perpetuates this dysfunctional dynamic.",

            "The characters, especially Marley, come off as excessively introspective and analytical, which feels unrealistic for a 19-year-old. Marley's self-appointed role as the savior of the Joseph family often frustrates, particularly her dramatic outbursts, such as when she screams at the school about Shay being \"her boy.\" Most characters lack likability, with the exception of Ruth, who sensibly chooses to leave town for a more peaceful life. The novel delves deeply into the dynamics of the Joseph family, highlighting Marley's quest for stability as she inserts herself into their lives.

The narrative begins with a compelling premise: a young woman relocates to a small town in western Pennsylvania and becomes the focus of two brothers entrenched in their family's roofing business and complex familial relationships. Elements of rivalry reminiscent of Cain and Abel, an Oedipal complex, and a King Lear-like dynamic with their father initially create intrigue.",
