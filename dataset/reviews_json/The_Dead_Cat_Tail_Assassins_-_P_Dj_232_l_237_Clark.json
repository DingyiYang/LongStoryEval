            "The characters in the story felt detached and emotionally shallow, making it difficult to connect with them. Although they were intricately detailed in appearance, clothing, and mannerisms, they came across as lifeless puppets. The absence of insight into their thoughts and feelings rendered their personalities unengaging, which ultimately diminished the story's tension and suspense.",
            "The writing is polished and evocative, especially in its sensory descriptions. However, the excessive focus on textural details, such as clothing, detracts from the overall narrative.",
            "The worldbuilding was vivid and detailed, especially in its portrayal of the city and carnival. However, it often felt too mundane, lacking a sense of otherworldly wonder. Elements like parades, gondolas, and colored powders echoed real-world events such as Mardi Gras, Venice, and Holi, which diminished the uniqueness of the fantasy setting. The excessive focus on mundane details, like clothing, overshadowed more intriguing aspects like culture and magic. While the ending, featuring a goddess, offered a satisfying escapist moment, it was a rare highlight in an otherwise overly descriptive narrative.",
            "The book did not measure up to the author’s previous works, like the *Dead Djinn Universe*. The characters lacked depth, the worldbuilding felt uninspired, and the excessive detailing made it a chore to read. I’m hesitant to pick up any future books from this author.",
            "The premise of an undead assassin drawn into a bizarre assignment, steeped in memories of her past and filled with mysteries, paradoxes, and fast-paced action, is undeniably enticing. While the plot is tightly paced and well-crafted, it leans heavily toward being plot-driven, ultimately sacrificing the anticipated entertainment value."

        "conclusion": "While the premise and plot were intriguing, the lack of emotional depth in the characters and the overly mundane worldbuilding made the book a disappointing read for me. Despite the polished writing and tight pacing, the story failed to deliver the escapism and engagement I expected from a fantasy novel.",

            "The third-person narration, primarily from Eveen’s perspective, is effective and engaging. Eveen’s modern youth vibe evokes a sense of Gideon the Ninth, which I appreciated. While the plotting becomes slightly convoluted towards the end, it remains captivating and maintains a brisk pace that makes the book hard to put down. The atmosphere is well-crafted and enhances the narrative. However, the clever epilogue raises ethical concerns, and the harsh, unsettling ending feels discordant with the otherwise light tone of the story.",
            "Eveen and the other characters navigate intriguing arcs that explore themes of mission and duty, with their struggles feeling both authentic and compelling. The portrayal of women as fully realized characters is commendable and refreshing. Additionally, the representation of characters with shades of brown skin adds a welcome diversity to the fantasy genre.",
            "The story is engaging, but the wording could be more concise. Some adjectives are excessive, and certain phrases could be trimmed for clarity. Additionally, the introduction of a dialect near the end feels jarring and disrupts the story's flow.",

The portrayal of the undead—distinct from traditional zombies—offers a refreshing perspective in fantasy literature. Additionally, the constraints of the assassins' religion and Eveen’s moral dilemma regarding a familiar target enrich the narrative, adding significant depth to the story."

The setting is rich and immersive, creating a unique backdrop for the story.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The main character, Eveen, is a member of the Dead Cat Tail Assassins, a guild of undead assassins who serve a goddess and have no memories of their former lives. Eveen is portrayed as a professional, but her decision to spare her latest mark after a sudden memory adds depth to her character and drives the plot forward.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story evolves into a fun mystery/adventure filled with magic, deadly assassins, mythology, necromancers, and unexpected revelations. The pacing keeps the reader engaged, and the plot twists are both surprising and satisfying.\n\n- **Tone and Humor:**  \n  The novel has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that adds a layer of enjoyment and made me laugh. This lighthearted tone balances the darker elements of the story, making it a fun read.\n\n- **Themes and Mythology:**  \n  The book explores themes of memory, identity, and loyalty, intertwined with rich mythology and necromantic elements. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding depth and intrigue.\n\n- **Potential for Future Stories:**  \n  The world and characters are compelling enough that I hope to see more stories set in this universe. The novel leaves room for further exploration and development.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful blend of mystery, adventure, and humor, set in a richly imagined world. The engaging plot, well-developed characters, and unique tone make it a highly enjoyable read. I look forward to more stories in this universe.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars rounded up."

            "This story features a delightful and humorous premise that I won't spoil, even though it's revealed fairly early on. I thought I had figured out the twist, but I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong!",
            "You know how a book's blurb often lists a series of rules that are destined to be broken? That’s my excuse for my earlier review, where I confidently claimed I’d read this on release day. It took me five months instead, but hey, rules are meant to be broken! (In reality, life just got hectic, and I couldn’t get to it sooner.)\n\nWhen this author releases a new book, I make it a point to read it—usually on the first day. That’s just how it goes!",
            "This audiobook offered a delightful and brisk experience, and I would gladly explore more stories set in this world. I continue to admire the author's writing and creativity; however, I found this particular installment less engaging than their previous works. I felt the emotional depth and specificity of the relationship between the main character and the other lead fell short, leaving me somewhat unsatisfied."

And that's my excuse for my earlier review, before reading, saying that I'll read this on the day it came out. It only took me like 5 months, but rules are made to be broken!

That's how it works.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile I found P. Djèlí Clark's latest novel enjoyable and appreciated its brisk pace and surprising twists, it didn't quite match the emotional depth and engagement of his previous works for me.

Despite meticulous descriptions of their appearances, clothing, quirks, and mannerisms, the characters remained detached and shallow, lacking insight into their thoughts and emotions. This absence of emotional depth made it hard to connect with them, leaving me indifferent to their fates and diminishing the impact of the action-packed plot.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Plot:**  \n   - The premise was enticing: an undead assassin pulled into a bizarre assignment tied to a mysterious past. The plot was fast-moving, filled with action, humorous dialogues, and intriguing paradoxes.  \n   - Despite the theoretically perfect setup, the story felt boring, and I had to push myself to finish it.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n   - I didn’t care about any of the characters, which made the tension and suspense fall flat.  \n   - The characters felt like intricately detailed puppets—beautifully crafted but lacking life. While their physical appearances, clothing, quirks, and mannerisms were meticulously described, they felt detached and shallow, with little insight into their thoughts or emotions.  \n   - This lack of emotional depth made it hard to connect with them, and I didn’t care about their fates, which diminished the impact of the action-packed plot.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n   - The worldbuilding was vivid and detailed, particularly in describing the city and carnival, which were portrayed as sensory feasts.  \n   - However, the world felt too mundane, drawing heavily from real-world inspirations like Mardi Gras, Venice, and Holi, which lacked a sense of otherworldly wonder.  \n   - The focus on mundane details, such as clothing descriptions, overshadowed more interesting aspects like the culture and magic of the world.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n   - Clark’s writing is polished and evocative, particularly in sensory descriptions.  \n   - The plot was tightly paced and well-structured, but it leaned too much into being a plot-driven \"popcorn read\" without delivering the same level of entertainment.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n   - The ending, particularly scenes involving a goddess, finally provided a satisfying sense of escapism, but this was too little, too late.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise, vivid worldbuilding, and polished writing, it ultimately fell flat for me due to its lack of emotional depth in characters and an overemphasis on mundane details. The story failed to evoke a sense of wonder or connection, making it less enjoyable than the author’s previous works. This might be the last book I pick up from P. Djèlí Clark.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 stars (described as a \"very weak 3-star\")."

            "The plot is straightforward and maintains a brisk pace, though it becomes somewhat dizzying by the end. The story is engaging and hard to put down. However, the ending, while clever and reminiscent of Br'er Rabbit's tricks, feels ethically unsettling and harsh, contrasting sharply with the otherwise lighthearted tone of the narrative.",
            "The protagonist, Eveen, embodies a modern youth vibe reminiscent of Gideon from *Gideon the Ninth*. Her character arc, along with those of the supporting cast, is compelling as they grapple with themes of mission and duty. It's refreshing to see a diverse array of characters with shades of brown skin in a fantasy setting. Additionally, the author distinguishes himself as one of the few male writers who authentically portrays women as fully realized individuals.",
            "The story is narrated in the third person, primarily from Eveen's perspective. While the character's voice is matter-of-fact, some adjectives come across as excessive, and the phrasing could be more concise. Additionally, a dialect introduced near the end feels jarring and disrupts the story's flow, appearing oddly specific and culturally inappropriate for the context.",

The concept of undead assassins, resurrected through magic and bound to their goddess, offers a fresh perspective on the undead. Additionally, the religious rules and constraints add significant depth to the narrative.",

While it wasn’t exactly what I hoped for, it didn’t disappoint either.\n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**\n   - The world-building is interesting and florid, but it works well within the context of the story. The constraints of the world are gradually introduced, making it easier to follow despite its complexity.\n   - The use of undead assassins, resurrected through magic and tied to their goddess, is one of the most unique takes on the undead I’ve encountered. The religious constraints and rules add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Characters and Representation:**\n   - Eveen, the protagonist, has a modern youth vibe that reminded me of Gideon from *Gideon the Ninth*. Her character arc, as well as those of others, is intriguing, with characters wrestling with mission and duty.\n   - The majority of characters have shades of brown skin, which is refreshing to see in fantasy. Djèlí Clark also stands out as one of the few male authors who writes women as fully realized people.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is straightforward and keeps the pace moving, though it gets a bit dizzying by the end.

While attention was paid to their physical appearances, clothing, quirks, and mannerisms, they remained detached and shallow, offering few insights into their thoughts or emotions. This absence of emotional depth hindered any connection with the characters, ultimately diminishing the story's tension and suspense.",

Elements like parades, gondolas, and colored powders echoed real-world events such as Mardi Gras, Venice, and Holi, which diminished the uniqueness of the fantasy setting. The excessive focus on trivial details, like clothing descriptions, overshadowed more intriguing aspects, including the culture and magic of the world."

            "The third-person narration, primarily from Eveen's perspective, is effective, capturing the modern youth vibe reminiscent of *Gideon the Ninth*, which I found enjoyable. The plot is straightforward and maintains a brisk pace, though it becomes somewhat dizzying by the end. The atmosphere complements the story well, enriching the overall experience. However, the unsettling and harsh epilogue feels at odds with the otherwise light-hearted, albeit high-stakes, tone. While the ending is impactful, it raises ethical concerns that left me feeling uneasy.",
            "The characters possess compelling arcs, especially in their struggles with mission and duty. The portrayal of women as fully realized individuals is commendable, and the diverse representation of characters with shades of brown skin adds a refreshing element to the fantasy genre.",

            "The concept of resurrected assassins bound to a goddess is one of the most intriguing interpretations of the undead I've encountered. The constraints of their religious practices, coupled with Eveen's moral dilemma when faced with the task of killing someone she knows, add significant depth to the narrative."

However, issues with the writing style, an out-of-place dialect, and an ethically unsettling epilogue prevent it from being a 5-star read.

I didn't feel satisfied emotionally by the depth and specificity of the relationship between the main character and the other main character.\n\n- **Plot and Conceit:**  \n  The book has an extremely fun and funny conceit (which I don't want to spoil, even if it's revealed close-ish to the beginning). I thought I'd guessed the reveal, but I hadn't, and I was very happy about that!\n\n- **Action and World-Building:**  \n  This has a lot of badass, action-packed, cool scenes, but I'm not super into action scenes. I would have preferred more texture to the world and the characters in place of that, even though the cool action scenes do give some texture to the world and characters.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Audiobook Experience:**  \n  It was still a really enjoyable, brisk audiobook experience. I would definitely read more in this world.\n\n- **Personal Connection and Timing:**  \n  The blurb/synopsis contained a series of rules that I knew would be broken in the course of the book, which is my excuse for not reading it on the day it came out. It only took me about 5 months to get to it because my life got busy, but rules are made to be broken! (Hahaha, no, my life just blew up, so I didn't get to it in time.)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I didn't find this book as emotionally engaging as P. Djèlí Clark's other works, it was still a fun and enjoyable read with a clever conceit and exciting action scenes. The audiobook experience was brisk and entertaining, and I would gladly explore more stories set in this world.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

While the gradual world-building is appreciated, the initial lack of background information on the setting, the assassins' guild, and the gods led to some confusion. I would have preferred more upfront details to enhance clarity.

Still, I believe the book could have benefited from a deeper exploration of the setting and lore to enrich the overall experience.",

            "The story is narrated in the third person, primarily from Eveen’s perspective, capturing a modern youth vibe reminiscent of *Gideon the Ninth*, which I appreciated. While the character's voice is matter-of-fact, some adjectives and phrasing could be streamlined for clarity. The plot is straightforward and maintains a brisk pace, though it becomes a bit dizzying towards the end. The epilogue, while clever, feels ethically unsettling and harsh, contrasting sharply with the otherwise light tone of the story.",
            "Eveen and the other characters navigate compelling arcs that explore themes of mission and duty. The diverse representation of characters with shades of brown skin is a refreshing addition to the fantasy genre. The author excels in crafting fully realized female characters, a commendable achievement that distinguishes this work from those of many male authors. Overall, the nuanced portrayal of women and the emphasis on diversity are significant highlights of the story.",

The concept of undead (not zombies) serving as assassins is one of the most compelling interpretations in fantasy literature. Additionally, the religious constraints and moral dilemmas faced by the protagonist, Eveen, enrich the narrative and add significant depth to the story."

While it doesn’t reach the level of my favorites, it’s still a worthwhile and intriguing addition to modern fantasy.",

            "The story is narrated in the third person, primarily through Eveen's perspective, giving it a modern youth vibe similar to *Gideon the Ninth*. The character's voice is straightforward, although some adjectives and phrasing could use refinement for improved flow. The plot is direct and maintains a brisk pace, though it becomes somewhat disorienting towards the end. While the conclusion is clever, it presents a morally unsettling and harsh twist that contrasts with the otherwise lighthearted tone of the narrative.",
            "Eveen and the other characters navigate compelling arcs that explore themes of mission and duty. The diverse representation of characters with shades of brown skin is a refreshing addition to the fantasy genre. Notably, the author excels in portraying women as fully realized individuals, a commendable achievement that distinguishes this work from those of many male authors.",
            "The atmosphere effectively enhances the plot, resulting in a cohesive reading experience. However, some wording, especially the adjectives, feels excessive and could be streamlined. Additionally, the introduction of a dialect near the end is jarring and disrupts the immersion.",
            "The world-building is rich and effectively integrated into the story. It enhances the plot while gradually revealing the world's constraints, making it easier to navigate despite its complexity.",
            "The premise of resurrected assassins linked to a goddess is both intriguing and unique. The portrayal of undead—distinct from traditional zombies—offers a fresh perspective in fantasy literature. Additionally, the religious constraints and Eveen's moral dilemmas when confronting a familiar target enrich the narrative, adding significant depth to the story."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Dead Cat Tail* is an engaging and hard-to-put-down story with a unique premise, strong world-building, and intriguing characters. However, issues with wording, an out-of-place dialect, and an ethically unsettling epilogue prevent it from being a 5-star read. While it surpasses the author’s previous work, it doesn’t quite reach the level of my favorites.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Premise and Concept:**\n   - The premise of assassins as resurrected undead tied to a goddess is intriguing and unique. The use of undead (not zombies) is one of the most interesting takes I’ve seen in fantasy literature.\n   - The religious constraints and Eveen’s moral conundrum when faced with a familiar target add depth to the story.\n\n- **Narration and Perspective:**\n   - The third-person narration primarily follows Eveen’s perspective, which has a modern youth feel reminiscent of *Gideon the Ninth*.\n   - The character voice is matter-of-fact, though some adjectives and phrasing could be tightened for better flow.\n\n- **World-Building:**\n   - The world-building is florid but well-used within the context of the story. It’s interesting and supports the plot effectively.\n   - The constraints of the world are gradually introduced, making it easier to follow despite the complexity.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - Eveen and other characters have intriguing arcs, wrestling with mission and duty. The majority of characters have shades of brown skin, which is a welcome representation in fantasy.\n   - Djèlí Clark’s ability to write women as fully realized people is commendable and stands out among male authors.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot is straightforward and keeps the pace moving, though it becomes slightly dizzying by the end.\n   - The ending, while clever, feels ethically unsettling and harsh, which contrasts with the otherwise fairly harmless tone of the story.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**\n   - The atmosphere is solid and complements the plot well, creating a cohesive reading experience.\n\n- **Language and Style:**\n   - Some wording feels excessive, particularly the adjectives, and could benefit from trimming.\n   - The introduction of a dialect near the end is jarring and feels out of place, disrupting the immersion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*Dead Cat Tail* is an engaging and hard-to-put-down story with a unique premise, strong world-building, and intriguing characters. However, issues with wording, an out-of-place dialect, and an ethically unsettling epilogue prevent it from being a 5-star read. While it surpasses Clark’s previous work, it doesn’t quite reach the level of my favorites.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- While no explicit rating is given, the review suggests a high 4-star rating, with reservations about reaching a perfect score due to the mentioned issues."

For example, I wanted to know more about Eveen’s hobbies or interests outside of her main role.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n   - The novel features one of the best closing lines I’ve ever read, though its impact is best understood in the context of the full story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n   - Despite some flaws, the book was highly enjoyable, and I appreciated the author’s storytelling style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel suffered from pacing issues and a lack of deeper character exploration, it was still a compelling read with memorable moments, particularly its standout closing line. This is the second book by Mr. Clark that I’ve enjoyed, and I look forward to more of his work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4/5"

While I enjoy romance, I often feel it overshadows larger themes in fantasy, and this book avoided that pitfall.  \n- **Pacing and Length:** The story is not overly drawn out, and I appreciated that it wasn’t part of an 8-book series. It felt just the right length.  \n- **Tone and Resolution:** The novel is a feel-good story with some darker elements like murder, but it wraps up neatly and satisfyingly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I loved this book. It’s a well-crafted, concise fantasy novel with strong representation and a balanced tone. It avoids the common overemphasis on romance and delivers a satisfying, self-contained story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot is engaging, presenting Eveen with two equally unappealing choices that heighten the tension and stakes. While seasoned fantasy readers may find the premise familiar, the unique twist and humor give it a refreshing feel. The pacing is generally steady, though it slows slightly in the middle before accelerating toward a satisfying conclusion. At around 200 pages divided into nine medium-length chapters, the novella format is effective, though it leaves room for deeper exploration of the world and characters.",
            "Eveen, the protagonist, is a well-developed and captivating character. The secondary characters are also well-crafted, though I would have liked to see more exploration of their backgrounds, a limitation likely due to the novella format.",
            "The world is introduced seamlessly, immersing the reader from the very beginning. The complexities of the setting unfold gradually, exemplifying the art of \"show, don't tell.\" The superb world-building adds significant depth to the story."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this book is a strong addition to the author’s body of work. The world-building, character development, and engaging plot make it a compelling read. While the novella format limits some aspects, the story delivers a fresh and enjoyable experience. I’m excited to see what the author writes next, whether it’s a return to this world or something entirely new.",

            "I found Eveen's character captivating—she's professional, undead, and deadly, which adds to her intrigue. The swearing throughout the book felt authentic and relatable. However, I struggled to understand the goddess's dialogue due to her dialect, leading me to skip some of her lines.",

            "I found the lack of background information at the beginning of the book quite confusing. I would have preferred a clearer introduction to the setting and the gods worshipped by the characters, rather than piecing it together as the story progressed. This confusion persisted throughout the book and ultimately affected my rating.",
