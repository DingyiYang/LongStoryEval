        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Standalone Nature and Connection to Previous Book:**\n   - The novel is marketed as a standalone companion, but I felt a disconnect with Thalia's character, likely because she was a main or strong supporting character in the first book. Henry and Thalia's prior meeting in the first book also made their rapid romance in this book feel less impactful without that context.\n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**\n   - The characters lacked depth, and their relationships felt surface-level. Thalia and Henry had some cute moments, but Eleanor and Owen's romance was particularly disappointing. Their interactions felt awkward and forced, with Owen's feelings for Eleanor remaining unclear until the very end.\n\n- **Romantic Development:**\n   - The romance was underdeveloped, especially for a historical romance. Thalia and Henry's relationship progressed too quickly, while Eleanor and Owen's connection felt one-sided and lacked genuine chemistry. The lack of substance in their interactions made their declarations of love hard to believe.\n\n- **Age Dynamics and Ethical Concerns:**\n   - The age gaps between characters, particularly Eleanor and Albert, were unsettling. Albert's marriage to a 16-year-old girl and his actions were glossed over, with no acknowledgment of the grooming or exploitation involved. This lack of critique left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict Resolution:**\n   - The plot was bare bones, with conflicts resolved too easily. The story lacked depth and complexity, making it hard to take seriously. The large cast of characters also added to the confusion, as none of them stood out as particularly memorable.\n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Technique:**\n   - The storytelling felt \"told\" rather than \"shown,\" with key elements like friendships, found family dynamics, and romances lacking emotional depth. This made the narrative feel flat and uninspired.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this book fell short of my expectations. The lack of character depth, underdeveloped romances, and unsettling age dynamics overshadowed any potential enjoyment.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The novel features a large cast of characters who are intricately intertwined, which adds a fun and dynamic element to the story. However, this complexity comes at the expense of deeper relationship development. The frequent shifts between characters and storylines made it difficult to fully invest in any one relationship. For instance, just as a sweet interaction between a couple began to unfold, the narrative would pivot to another character or plotline, leaving the relationship progression feeling rushed and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Pacing of Relationship Progression:**  \n  The pacing of romantic relationships felt too fast, making it hard to believe the depth of the characters' feelings. I often found myself questioning the authenticity of their emotions, as their interactions seemed to still be in the \"getting to know you\" phase rather than the \"full-blown feelings\" stage. This disconnect made it challenging to fully engage with the romantic arcs.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel's intricate web of characters and storylines is enjoyable, the lack of focused relationship development and the rushed pacing of romantic progression detracted from my overall engagement. The frequent shifts between characters left me wanting more depth and authenticity in their connections.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story is largely predictable, but predictability isn't inherently negative. However, the introduction of numerous characters—almost twenty—at once felt overwhelming.

I was hoping this book would have a similar effect, but I found it a little bland in comparison. I couldn’t bring myself to care as much about the characters in this one, unlike the first book where I really liked Kalli and Adam.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  I think it would have been really sweet if Thalia and Eleanor had ended up together, but I did think that Eleanor and Owen were good together, as I love class difference romances. However, I was a little put off by the lack of chemistry between the couples. I know it’s YA, so it won’t have any steam, but I just didn’t really feel the connection.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  It definitely wasn’t bad at all and was a quick and easy read.  \n\n- **Overall Recommendation:**  \n  I prefer the first book and would recommend that more.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile this book was a quick and easy read, it didn’t quite live up to the charm of the first book in the series.
