            "In this story, the intertwined lives of the three main characters—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—are marked by their pursuit of each other's approval and purpose. Their interactions unfold in a clean, almost cartoonish manner, striking a balance between reality and exaggeration. This dynamic not only emphasizes their material differences but also reveals their moments of division and reconciliation.",
            "The prose is both evocative and striking, offering vivid descriptions of New York that blend realism and poetry. For instance:  \n- “An early-morning thunderstorm leaves the streets smelling clean and metallic, only for the August heat to return and bake the garbage anew.”  \n- “The skyline, the river, the necklace of the Brooklyn Bridge—chemical moonglow, car horns, and shouts, what joy.”  \n- “Love with vigilance. Love, but with sharps.”  \n\nEach example captures the city's unique atmosphere and complexity.",
            "The novel delves into the tension between the value of art and the life of the artist, examining how art can shape existence and the distinction between art and performance. It poses critical questions about how artistic expressions of truth and ways of living can preserve cultures at risk of extinction. Throughout, the narrative implicitly and explicitly asks, \"What will save us?\" suggesting that community and the preservation of memory are key to survival.",
            "The novel skillfully weaves humor into its narrative, often through sharp, witty observations. For instance, Ellen remarks, “The politics are corny, and so are the white boys, but the music? It’s what rage and loathing would sound like if you regurgitated it. It’s the sound of regurgitation, all right.”"

Its evocative prose, sharp humor, and critique of neoliberal narratives make it a compelling read. While it doesn’t address climate change, it offers timely answers to questions about what sustains us in the face of existential threats.",

This made me laugh, because Mall Piece came out of her growing up in New Jersey.”  \n     - “I choose [x] over [y], the [z] over marriage and middle-class-assimilationist Asian America, kids whose sole protest was complaining about the lack of Asian actors in a Hollywood movie. I never regretted it.”  \n\n- **Exploration of Memory and History:**  \n   - The novel delves into the importance of memory and the dangers of an artificial, inaccurate version of the past.  \n   - Examples:  \n     - “An artificial, inaccurate version of the past, but when it was the sole version available, what else was there to compare it to? The recreation was assumed as truth.”  \n     - “You could spend a lifetime subsisting on the fumes of your own memory. The past was an easy drug to fall into, especially when it contained love.”  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply thought-provoking exploration of art, identity, memory, and community, set against the backdrop of a technocratic dystopia.

            "The first two-thirds of the novel resemble familiar literary fiction, gliding swiftly over Giselle's and Jackie's young adult experiences without giving any moment significant weight. As a result, I found both women's stories lacking in depth and exploration. However, the narrative shifts dramatically when it jumps to 2043, with Ellen, now in her seventies, recounting a dystopian future in the first person. This twist partially redeems the novel, as it juxtaposes the women's early lives with a challenging future, illuminating their choices about selling out in a world dominated by a few corporations. Yet, the lack of development in this dystopian vision leaves it feeling somewhat underwhelming.",
            "Giselle's performance art, inspired by Tehching Hsieh's work, held promise, but I found it unconvincing and felt the narrative fell short in exploring how a year of isolated living in a mall affected her. Similarly, Jackie's storyline lacked the necessary depth and impact. The relationships among the three women, intended to be central to the plot, felt underdeveloped due to their minimal interactions as a group.",
            "The 1980s and 1990s New York art scene is captured more compellingly in Rachel Lyon's *Self-Portrait With Boy* and Siri Hustvedt's *The Blazing World*, while Allegra Goodman's *The Cookbook Collector* vividly depicts the dot-com boom.",
            "I adored the author's debut novel, *The Leavers*, and eagerly anticipated her second work, *Memory Piece*, drawn in by both her impressive track record and the captivating blurb. The premise, featuring three Asian-American teenage girls—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—coming together in 1980s New York while pursuing distinct paths as a performance artist, coder, and community activist, was particularly intriguing."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  I especially liked the first and second parts of the book. However, the third and last part felt different. It seemed as if Ko wasn't entirely sure of what her dystopian future looked like or how to incorporate the large time skip naturally. This resulted in awkward exposition and a shift in writing style that was off-putting, though not in the way Ko intended.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The characters and setting felt incredibly real. However, I wish there had been more exploration of the friendship between the three women early on. The readers don't really know what binds them together, which left me wanting more depth in their relationships.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Subtlety:**  \n  My biggest issue with the book was the lack of subtlety. The writing style in the latter part of the book felt forced and inconsistent with the earlier sections, which detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first two parts of the book were engaging with well-crafted characters and a vivid setting, the third part struggled with pacing, exposition, and a jarring shift in writing style. The lack of subtlety and insufficient exploration of the characters' relationships were notable drawbacks.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3 stars"

While the structure can occasionally be perplexing, it ultimately encourages a fresh exploration of storytelling.",

Ellen, a squatter, critiques capitalism while contemplating a dystopian future in the 2040s. Jackie, the queer tech-savvy character, adds a unique perspective that sets her apart from the others. Together, these characters deliver impactful social commentary that resonates long after reading, reminiscent of the characters in *The Leavers*.",

Gizelle, a performance artist, challenges traditional notions of \"work\" through her unpaid, conceptual pieces focused on self-inquiry. Ellen, a squatter, resists capitalism and reflects on a dystopian future in the 2040s.

I’m glad I did because I ended up enjoying it more than I expected.\n\n- **Nostalgia and Personal Connection:**\n   - As someone born in 1980, the 80s section of the novel felt deeply nostalgic and bittersweet. It resonated with my own memories of a better past contrasted with a difficult present, which made the themes of memory preservation and loss particularly poignant.\n\n- **Engagement with Themes:**\n   - The exploration of memory—both fighting and preserving it—kept me engaged throughout the book. It spoke directly to my own struggles with despair and loss, making the narrative deeply personal and compelling.\n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**\n   - Giselle’s section was my favorite. Her art-as-life/life-as-art journey felt genuine and honest, even in its ambiguity. Her constant search for meaning and the \"itch\" she was trying to scratch felt like the essence of art itself. I found her intriguing and relatable, someone I would have been drawn to in real life.\n   - Jackie’s section was less engaging for me, possibly because the early internet era feels less intriguing now. However, I appreciated her struggle to stay true to her vision amidst a chaotic world.\n   - Ellen’s character evoked a strong protective instinct in me, given the oppressive society she inhabits. Her storyline felt terrifyingly plausible, reflecting current societal issues.\n\n- **World-Building and Futuristic Elements:**\n   - The futuristic elements, while speculative, felt realistic and grounded in current realities. The portrayal of a near-future society was both believable and unsettling, especially for someone like me who is disabled and faces societal neglect.\n\n- **Overall Success of the Book:**\n   - Despite its imperfections, I think the author largely succeeded in what she set out to do. The book’s appeal might vary depending on the reader’s life circumstances, age, or personal experiences, but it worked exceptionally well for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis book resonated deeply with me due to its exploration of memory, loss, and personal struggle.

            "The book features an intriguing structure but can be challenging to engage with at first. The opening third, focused on performance art, lacks allure, and the characters appear narcissistic and irritable. However, the narrative picks up speed in the second section, set during the 1990s tech boom, evoking a strong sense of nostalgia. The final third, set in a dystopian 2040s, is compelling and hard to put down.",
            "In the first section, the characters come across as unlikable and self-absorbed. However, they become more relatable in the 1990s segment. The depiction of tech-adjacent characters is especially accurate and nostalgic.",
            "The 1980s setting is appealing but lacks an initial resonance. In contrast, the depiction of the 1990s tech growth era is vivid and relatable, particularly for those immersed in tech-nerd culture. The dystopian 2040s is both believable and tangible, offering a compelling narrative that evolves from algorithms and data analytics to extreme gentrification and controlled zones.",

It delves into how these elements shape our identities, origins, and futures.\n\n- **Structure and Pacing:**\n   - The book is structurally interesting but initially difficult to engage with. The first third, centered around performance art, felt less captivating, and the characters came across as narcissistic and stroppy. However, the narrative gains momentum in the second section, set in the 1990s tech boom, which evokes a strong sense of nostalgia. The final third, set in a dystopian 2040s, is gripping and hard to put down.\n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**\n   - The 1980s setting, while appealing, didn’t fully resonate initially. The 1990s tech growth era, however, is vividly portrayed and relatable, especially for those who were socially connected to the tech-nerd culture. The dystopian 2040s setting is believable and tangible, with a compelling arc from algorithms and data analytics to extreme gentrification and controlled zones.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - The characters in the first section felt unlikable and self-absorbed, but they become more recognizable and relatable in the 1990s section. The portrayal of tech-adjacent characters is particularly accurate and nostalgic.\n\n- **Relevance and Thought-Provocation:**\n   - The novel is packed with thought-provoking ideas, making it an excellent choice for book clubs. It raises important questions about data privacy, the value of memories, and the significance of friendships.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite a slow start, *Memory Piece* by Lisa Ko is a deeply profound and ambitious novel that explores the complexities of friendship, memory, and identity across different eras. The 1990s tech boom and the dystopian 2040s settings are particularly compelling, offering a rich, thought-provoking narrative that rewards persistence.

The narrative examines the complexities of assimilation, cultural identity, and the tension between tradition and modernity.

Despite its potential, I found it incredibly difficult to engage with and enjoy.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the middle section of the novel stood out as the strongest, the confusing timeline, lack of distinct character development, and overall difficulty in engagement made this book a challenging and unsatisfying read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The author excels at crafting complex, flawed, and relatable characters. Giselle Chin, an obsessive artistic genius, grapples with profound internal struggles and insecurities, rendered through a third-person past-tense narrative that strikes a balance between distance and intimacy. Jackie Ong, a tech-savvy dreamer who shares my identity as a lesbian, is portrayed in a dynamic third-person present-tense narrative that captures her fast-paced ambition. Ellen Ng, a squatter and activist, is celebrated for her selflessness and commitment to community-building, though her first-person past-tense narration, while intimate and reflective, feels somewhat constrained by the dystopian setting. I particularly resonate with Jackie, as our shared identities—lesbian, artist, leftist—inform my connection to her story.

She obsesses over memories, framing and interrogating them through her work, such as her piece *Memory Piece*, where she writes daily memories for a year and then burns the journals.  \n     - Jackie, a developer, creates a platform for people to share their thoughts, which becomes a stockpile of memories. She realizes the potential to monetize user data, reflecting a more utilitarian view of memory.  \n     - Ellen, a community activist in her 70s, sees memories as a liability. In her world, recalling the past can be dangerous, and people suppress memories to survive. Her ex-boyfriend even forgets her, possibly as a protective mechanism.  \n   - The novel explores how memory can be an expression of freedom, a tool for art, or a dangerous liability, depending on the context.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Originality:**  \n   - The story is divided into three main parts, each focusing on a different time period and character.  \n   - The narrative is built around artifacts and archives, giving it a layered and reflective quality.  \n   - The novel feels original, ambitious, and expressive, pushing boundaries in its exploration of time, memory, and identity.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Reflection:**  \n   - The novel is captivating in its portrayal of how time and memory evolve and shape the characters' lives.  \n   - It left a lasting impression, prompting continued reflection and enjoyment.  \n   - The reader was so engaged that they immediately sought out another book by the same author, *The Leavers*.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a deeply original and ambitious exploration of time, memory, and identity through the lives of three compelling characters. Its layered narrative structure and thought-provoking themes make it a memorable and impactful read, leaving the reader eager to reflect further and explore more of the author's work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

            "The novel is structured into three parts, each highlighting a different Asian American friend at distinct life stages. The first part follows a performance artist from junior high to early adulthood in the 80s and 90s, showcasing unconventional and at times implausible performance art inspired by a real artist. The second part focuses on a gay IT programmer during the internet boom and bust, while the third explores a home squatter navigating a dystopian future. Central themes include the significance of creativity and individuality, the value of community, and the perils of unchecked capitalism and libertarianism that can lead to a police state.",
            "The characters are Asian American, yet their cultural background is not a focal point, making their ethnicity feel almost incidental. They are relatable, particularly as they are around the same age as the reader. Each character's journey—be it as a performance artist, programmer, or squatter—showcases a range of diverse experiences and struggles.",
            "The first two sections are set in realistic environments, with the second part vividly depicting the internet boom and bust era. The third section, set 30 years later, immerses readers in a dystopian nightmare that raises fascinating questions about how society arrived at this point. While the squatter lifestyle and poverty are romanticized in the second section through a strong sense of community, this theme reverberates into the dystopian future, adding depth to the narrative.",
            "This book stands out for its unique structure and its exploration of unconventional lifestyles and societal critiques. However, some aspects, particularly the performance art, can come across as unbelievable. Additionally, while the dystopian future is intriguing, it raises several unanswered questions."

However, there were some interesting themes about art and identity, even if I didn’t fully “get it.”  \n  - Jackie (Part 2): This section was told in first person, which made it easier to connect with her. I liked this part a little better.  \n  - Ellen (Part 3): This section was set in a dystopian future and felt like a huge tonal shift. The in-your-face commentary didn’t work for me, and I found it hard to engage with.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution:**  \n  The book markets the friendship between the three women, but there was very little meaningful interaction between them. The “memory piece” that spans the book was confusing, and I didn’t really understand the ending.  \n\n- **Reading Experience:**  \n  I considered not finishing the book (DNF) but ended up mostly skimming.

Giselle's journey through her memories reveals a shift in perspective, as she begins to view her actions as future memories (p. 50). The online world is depicted as an underground club, offering a sense of relief from the pressure to be authentic (p. 104). The narrative warns that privacy may soon become obsolete, with everyone living in a constant state of public display (p. 138). It also reflects on the past as a drug, where one can become trapped in the fumes of their own memories (p. 196). The book emphasizes that art is labor, equating creative work with other forms of employment, such as working in a café (p. 202). The absence of records from the past is portrayed as a result of caution (p. 246). \n\nThis novel speaks to those who embrace the chaos of creativity, finding meaning in both the mundane and the extravagant. It particularly resonates with Generation X, especially those familiar with the punk rock underground scene in 1980s and 90s New York City, appealing to readers who appreciate literary fiction and art in a commodified world."

The stark contrast between intense sensory descriptions of unpleasant odors and sudden glamorous, sexy moments felt jarring and detracted from the overall experience.",

            "The author seeks to explore philosophical themes of memory and experience, yet these ideas are often overshadowed by the characters' obsession with New York City. While the notion that activism gains depth when coupled with personal neglect (such as being unwashed) is somewhat compelling, it contradicts the depiction of a glamorous sex life, leading to an incongruous narrative.",
            "I appreciated the focus on the late '90s internet boom and the subsequent economic downturn, which is often overshadowed by the 2008 recession. However, the author's unfamiliarity with the tech industry resulted in inaccuracies, such as misidentifying tech companies and their leaders in New York City, which is not a major tech hub."

The insular focus on New York City, inconsistent tone, and lack of authenticity in certain aspects made it difficult to connect with the story or characters. The final dystopian section further undermined my enjoyment due to its unrealistic elements. I cannot recommend this book, though I gave it two stars because it held my interest long enough to finish for a book group.",

            "The execution of the story falters as each chapter delves into a different friend's life, resulting in a cluttered narrative. The book overwhelms with name-drops—ranging from pop culture relics to random childhood acquaintances—alongside a dizzying array of artists, tech moguls, and obscure art installations. The final chapter, set in 2040, feels tonally disconnected, resembling a separate story that might have worked better as a standalone novella.",
            "The characters in the story lack depth, coming across more as sketches than fully developed individuals. Giselle is defined by her rebellious spirit and career in performance art, heavily influenced by her Chinese Filipino immigrant parents, especially her mother's obsession with weight and diet. Jackie, hailing from a privileged Chinese family, initially follows her family's expectations but ultimately drops out of college to pursue her passion for coding. Although she becomes an engineer, she grapples with moral dilemmas and professional setbacks. Ellen, the community activist, feels the most detached from the trio, with her storyline only briefly intersecting with Jackie's. Her chapter set in 2040 introduces a dystopian future that feels disjointed from the main narrative.",
            "The writing style in the final chapter shifts dramatically, creating an abrupt contrast with earlier sections. Its heavy reliance on pop culture references and New York-specific details could alienate readers who are not familiar with this context.",
            "The book addresses a plethora of themes, including teenage body image issues, Asian parental expectations, queer love, social activism, performance art, the dot-com bubble burst, and climate change. However, the social commentary often feels disjointed and overwhelming, as it tries to encompass too many topics within the narrative. The premise of following three women over several decades, tracing the evolution of their lives and friendships, is intriguing. The story centers on three Asian American teenagers—Giselle Chi, Jackie Ong, and Ellen Ng—who meet at a Chinese school in 1980s New York and navigate their fluctuating friendship up to a dystopian future in 2040."

As young adults, they face ethical dilemmas: Giselle's art is co-opted, Jackie is employed by a data-stealing startup, and Ellen remains dedicated to her activism. Among them, Ellen emerges as the most heroic figure, embodying communitarian values and establishing a life at Sola House, a resilient squat.",

            "The friendship between Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen is captivating, particularly due to Ellen's unique role within the trio. At first, Jackie and Ellen appear similar, but their differences emerge over time. Ellen's life in the city adds complexity to her interactions with Giselle and Jackie, creating a more nuanced dynamic. However, the introduction of numerous characters in various scenes can be overwhelming and makes it difficult to identify who truly matters in the story.",
            "The writing was solid but not exceptional. Had it been more impressive, I might have been more engaged by the dystopian elements, despite my personal preferences.",
            "I enjoy stories that explore friendship, particularly among East Asian women. However, the last third of the book transitions into a dystopian setting, which isn't my preference. The time capsule and archive elements didn't resonate with me, leaving me less engaged with the details presented."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I liked *Memory Piece*, but I felt a bit confused and didn’t connect with it as deeply as I wanted to. The exploration of female friendship was compelling, but the dystopic turn and the inclusion of many names made it harder for me to fully engage. While the writing was good, it didn’t captivate me enough to overcome my personal preferences. My changing reading habits might also have played a role in my mixed feelings.",

If it had been, I might have been more drawn into the dystopic sections despite my preferences.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n   - Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen’s friendship is interesting, particularly Ellen’s role within the trio. Initially, Jackie and Ellen seemed similar, but their differences became more apparent later.  \n   - Ellen’s relationship with the others is intriguing because she lives in the city with her own life, making her dynamic with Giselle and Jackie less straightforward.  \n   - The inclusion of many names in scenes felt deliberate but confusing, as I struggled to keep track of who was important.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Work:**  \n   - I really loved *The Leavers* (Lisa’s other book), so I was excited for *Memory Piece*. While I liked it, I didn’t love it as much as I had hoped.  \n\n- **Personal Reading Experience:**  \n   - I’ve been reflecting on how friendships are portrayed in books, especially after reading *Stay True* for class.  \n   - My reading habits have changed; I now read in shorter bursts rather than immersing myself for hours, which might have affected my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I liked *Memory Piece*, but I felt a bit confused and didn’t connect with it as deeply as I wanted to.

            "The novel traces the lives of three childhood friends—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—over a span of 60 years, with the passage of time as a central theme. Divided into three sections, each dedicated to one of the women, the narrative unfolds in a linear progression. The final section, set in 2040, introduces a futuristic, semi-speculative tone that, despite not being my usual preference, was effective in this context.",
            "Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen are strong, well-defined characters who consistently uphold their values and identity, even in difficult situations. Giselle’s daring choice to live in a mall for a year as a performance artist, Jackie’s involvement in the late 90s dot-com boom, and Ellen’s activism in a socialist squat showcase their distinctive personalities and life choices.",

These explorations add rich layers to the narrative.  \n   - I particularly enjoyed the focus on performance art, as it provided a solid introduction to a field I’m less familiar with, despite my love for art museums.  \n\n- **Genre Blending and Dystopian Elements:**  \n   - The novel blends coming-of-age and dystopian literature, with the dystopian elements touching on our current obsessions and dependence on technology.  \n   - The story includes important messages and warnings that feel relevant and, at times, uncomfortably close to home.  \n\n- **Pacing and Cohesion:**  \n   - The book starts off slowly, and the beginning feels less cohesive compared to the middle and end. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall experience.  \n\n- **Thematic Depth:**  \n   - The novel explores universal themes such as friendship, love, loss, loyalty, resilience, and community, which are common to well-loved texts.  \n   - The title, *Memory Piece*, reflects the emphasis on memory and its role in our lives, both implicitly and explicitly.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Memory Piece* is a fantastic read that offers a rich exploration of friendship, dreams, and societal issues through the lives of three compelling characters. Despite a slow start, the novel’s thematic depth, genre blending, and insightful commentary make it a highly recommendable book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The ending of *Memory Piece* left me perplexed. I couldn't determine whether Giselle had orchestrated the memory piece or if she simply emerged from hiding to reflect on her friends' lives. This ambiguity made it challenging to grasp the intended resolution. The novel tells a futuristic yet retrospective story of three Asian American characters—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—at different stages of their lives. It delves into themes such as sexuality, environmental activism, careers, relationships, and the effects of an uncertain world shaped by the rise of the internet. The narrative transitions from Giselle's performative art pieces in her youth to Jackie's struggles with corporate ethics in middle adulthood, culminating in Ellen's life in a dystopian 2040s dominated by tech companies.",

Jackie, in her middle years, juggles a corporate job, a side coding project, and personal challenges, nearly losing everything after exposing her company's unethical practices. Meanwhile, Ellen, in late adulthood, navigates a dystopian future as a community activist, struggling to survive in a tech-dominated world while squatting in an abandoned building with fellow activists.",

The novel’s abstract approach and lack of cohesion left me waiting for a moment that never arrived, making it a forgettable experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Engagement and Pacing: 2/5  \n- Character Development: 3/5  \n- Narrative Cohesion: 2/5  \n- Emotional Impact: 1/5  \n- Overall Rating: 2/5"

The intertwined relationships of the three women felt realistic and resonated with me, reflecting the ebb and flow of my own friendships. The alternating focus on each character provided a 360-degree view, allowing for a deeper understanding of their flaws and motivations.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  Ko painted a vivid picture of New York in the 80s, 90s, and 00s, which I found immersive and engaging. The first two-thirds of the novel captured a sense of hope and expansive thinking, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Style:**  \n  The novel’s structure, with sections focusing on each character in turn, was effective in providing a multifaceted perspective. However, the final section’s stylistic shift from third- to first-person felt jarring to me. The abrupt change disrupted my reading experience, and I found myself reluctant to continue.  \n\n- **Themes and Dystopian Elements:**  \n  The final section introduced a dystopian near-future where humanity exists under hypersurveillance, with segregation based on wealth and race. While thought-provoking and uncomfortably close to reality, the claustrophobic and anxiety-ridden world depicted in this section contrasted sharply with the hopeful tone of the earlier parts, making it harder for me to connect with.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, Ko’s novel is a thought-provoking exploration of friendship, identity, and societal issues.

The abrupt transition from a realistic past to a dystopian future in the final section caught me off guard, particularly since I hadn’t closely reviewed the book’s description.

            "The novel opens as a nostalgic 80s coming-of-age tale centered on three friends—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—who meet in childhood and grow into distinct lives. However, its disjointed and experimental structure made it challenging for me to engage fully with the narrative. Although I admire the author's ambition, I found the unconventional choices somewhat perplexing.",

The structure is unusual, disjointed, and experimental, which made it harder for me to fully connect with the story. While I appreciated the ambition, I wasn’t sure what to make of all the narrative choices.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ko crafts fascinating characters, each with distinct trajectories. Giselle is drawn to performance art and creates pieces based on the medium of time. Jackie, a coding prodigy, navigates the New York tech scene during the dot-com bubble, torn between her corporate job and her passion project. Ellen becomes an activist, fighting for squatters' rights and building a community in a vacant building. Their relationships evolve over decades, with Giselle and Jackie drifting in and out of Ellen’s orbit.  \n\n- **Themes and Atmosphere:**  \n  The novel explores themes of art, technology, activism, and the passage of time. Giselle’s art and Ellen’s experiences in a dystopian future unsettled me in different ways, while Jackie’s journey through the early internet was the most engaging part of the book for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Ko writes beautifully, with a lyrical and evocative prose style. However, the experimental structure and disjointed narrative made the overall reading experience less effective for me than I had hoped.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Previous Work:**  \n  This book is impressively different from Ko’s debut, *The Leavers*. While I admired the boldness of her approach, I found it harder to connect with this novel. Still, I’m curious to see what she writes next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Memory Piece* has many compelling elements—beautiful writing, fascinating characters, and thought-provoking themes—the experimental structure and disjointed narrative made the overall experience less satisfying for me. I particularly enjoyed Jackie’s storyline, but the book as a whole didn’t resonate as deeply as I had hoped.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated that it wasn't solely focused on their racial identity; instead, it simply presented them as individuals—girls who happen to be Asian American. This approach was refreshing, especially after *Portrait of a Thief*. I'm weary of common Asian American tropes, such as the pressure to please parents or struggles in predominantly white spaces. We are more than those stereotypes, and the author skillfully portrayed three relatable characters who felt genuine and vividly present in my mind.",

However, the transition to a first-person narrative featuring a woman in her seventies in this divisive future feels jarring and disconnected from the earlier storyline.

The author does not clarify what major event occurred during this time, leaving a gap in the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Giselle Chin is portrayed as an artist whose performance art projects are supported by Jackie Ong.  \n   - Jackie Ong is a complex character: she is gay, works as a programmer, and becomes involved in both Giselle's art and Ellen's activism. She spends time at Ellen's commune, Sola, and has a physical relationship with Ellen but ultimately decides to \"sell out.\"  \n   - Ellen Ng is an activist who runs the commune Sola, where Jackie temporarily resides.  \n\n- **Themes and Tone:**  \n   - The novel presents an extremely pessimistic vision of the future, culminating in a dystopian society by 2040.  \n   - The final vision of society is unsettling and difficult to connect with, as it does not align with the reader's hopes or beliefs.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement:**  \n   - I found it hard to identify with any of the protagonists, which made it challenging to fully engage with the story.  \n   - The lack of explanation about the major event between the early 2000s and the dystopian future left me feeling disconnected and confused.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel explores the interconnected lives of three women against a backdrop of societal change, but its pessimistic tone and unclear narrative gaps made it difficult for me to connect with the story or its characters. The dystopian vision of the future was unsettling and hard to reconcile with my own beliefs.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel centers around three friends—Ellen, Giselle, and Jackie—navigating life from their teenage years to old age. The story explores their growth under the influence of immigrant parents who aspire for better lives for them. However, the last third of the book takes a dystopian turn, which felt somewhat disjointed from the rest of the narrative.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Each character forges a distinct path, shaped by their upbringing and circumstances. Ellen and Jackie, who are portrayed as more privileged, make decisions that reflect their relative advantages. Giselle, on the other hand, stands out as the most compelling character, expressing herself through her art in unique and intriguing ways.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The book delves into themes of privilege, ambition, and the immigrant experience. While the exploration of these themes is solid, some of the characters' decisions felt messy, particularly in light of their differing levels of privilege.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Genre Shift:**  \n  The author’s writing style is engaging, but the abrupt shift to a dystopian tone in the final third of the book was unexpected and didn’t seamlessly integrate with the earlier narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a solid read, especially for a first-time experience with this author. While the dystopian shift felt out of place, the exploration of the characters' lives and the immigrant experience was compelling. I’m curious to check out the author’s first book, *The Levelers*, in the future.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.75/5"

However, when the book was due back at the library and I returned to it later, I had lost the momentum. This is more a reflection of my attention span than the construction of the story.  \n\n- **Historical Accuracy and Plausibility:**  \n  Ko's accounts of the 1990s and the 2000 dot-com crash felt plausible to me. They seemed like an accurate rendering of a time I’m starting to forget. Her predictions for the future in Ellen's section also feel entirely plausible at the dawn of 2025.  \n\n- **Themes and Ideas:**  \n  Ko's ideas about performance art and archives are thought-provoking. However, I think I lost the thread a bit due to my long pause in the middle of the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Value:**  \n  I valued the book both for its consideration of the past and its predictions about the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite losing momentum due to a break in reading, I found the book engaging and thought-provoking. Ko’s portrayal of historical events and her plausible predictions for the future added significant value to the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The realistic characters, evocative setting, and impactful ending made it a memorable read that resonated with my own life experiences.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, I don’t think extensive character development was the author’s primary intention.  \n\n- **Reader Experience:**  \n  The book is worth the read if you enjoy philosophical or existential themes. However, if you’re looking for characters to fall in love with, this might not be the right choice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel is a thought-provoking and compelling exploration of life, legacy, and existential questions.

Rather than a dystopia, it feels like a logical extension of our present-day realities, marked by surveillance, policing, and capitalism. However, the author leaves unanswered the question of how we can prevent this future from becoming a reality—a point I wish she had addressed.

The young and exciting lives of the three characters, set against the backdrop of 90s-2000s NYC and the art scene, drew me in completely.  \n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The second half, however, let me down. The dystopian future section dragged for far too long, and I found it less compelling compared to the earlier part of the story.  \n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n  I was invested in all three characters, but I wish they had stayed with us throughout the entire novel instead of being split into three separate points of view.  \n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The dystopian future did evoke a strong existential and emotional response, which I welcomed, but it wasn’t enough to salvage the pacing issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the first half of the novel was captivating and immersive, the second half fell short due to its slow pacing and less engaging dystopian setting. The emotional depth was appreciated, but the structural choices and prolonged focus on the future detracted from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This layered approach adds depth and intrigue to the storytelling.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  I found the book to be a captivating and thought-provoking read. The exploration of memory and its multifaceted nature resonated deeply with me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the meta elements woven throughout the narrative.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a brilliantly crafted, meta-narrative that delves into the complexities of memory through artful storytelling and well-developed characters. It is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, making it a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The narrative feels rushed, the ending is unconvincing, and its attempts at exploring deeper themes and cultural experiences are not fully realized.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book opens in the 1980s, focusing on three Asian teens: Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen. As the narrative unfolds, it shifts between their lives. The first section, centered on Giselle, stands out as the strongest. A budding performance artist, her unique journey to establish herself in the art world is captivating, despite her unconventional performances—such as writing and burning diaries or living in a mall for a year. Giselle’s intriguing character shines through her eccentricities.\n\nNext, we shift to Jackie, who navigates the early days of the tech industry while running her own platform and falling in love with a woman online. This segment tackles the internet's dangers, sexism in the dot-com world, and weaves in a love story. While ambitious, it feels somewhat overcrowded.\n\nThe final section, set in the 2040s, veers into dystopia, depicting a police state in NYC, complete with delivery bikes and checkpoints. Unfortunately, this part feels underdeveloped and heavy-handed, with the author's political views overshadowing the characters. I wished for more depth in Ellen's storyline and less overt messaging.",
            "Giselle's section stood out as the most compelling, featuring a well-developed and engaging character. Jackie’s story was intriguing but felt overloaded with themes. In contrast, Ellen’s section lacked the depth I sought, as the dystopian backdrop overshadowed her character.",
            "The author delves into various themes such as art, technology, love, sexism, and dystopian futures. However, the book's ambition leads to a sense of overstuffing, and the messaging in the final section comes across as too overt for my liking. I tend to prefer more subtle storytelling.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed the author's debut novel, *The Leavers*, so I was eager to dive into their new book. I'm also naturally drawn to stories that incorporate art, which made this one particularly appealing."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Previous Work and Expectations:**  \n  I really enjoyed Ko’s debut, *The Leavers*, so I was eager to read her new book. Additionally, I’m always drawn to books with an art element, which made this even more appealing.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The book begins in the 1980s with three Asian teens: Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen. The story progresses through time, shifting focus between their lives. The first section, focusing on Giselle, was the strongest in my opinion. She’s a budding performance artist, and her journey to establish herself in the art world is fascinating, even though her performances are bizarre—like writing diaries and burning them or living in a mall for a year. Despite the oddity, or perhaps because of it, Giselle is an intriguing character.  \n\n  The second section shifts to Jackie, who works in tech during its early days, running her own platform and falling in love with a woman online. This section tackles the dangers and corruption of the internet, sexism in the dot-com industry, and includes a love story. While ambitious, it felt like a lot to juggle.  \n\n  The final section, set in the 2040s, takes a dystopian turn, depicting a police state with delivery bikes and checkpoints to leave NYC. This part felt underdeveloped and heavy-handed, with Ko’s political views overshadowing the characters. I wanted more depth for Ellen and less overt messaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Giselle’s section was the most compelling, as her character felt well-developed and engaging. Jackie’s story was interesting but overcrowded with themes. Ellen’s section, however, lacked the depth I craved, as the dystopian setting overshadowed her character.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  Ko explores a wide range of themes, including art, technology, love, sexism, and dystopian futures. While ambitious, the book felt overstuffed, and the messaging in the final section was too overt for my taste. I prefer subtlety in storytelling.  \n\n- **Overall Execution:**  \n  The book would have been stronger if Ko had focused on fewer ideas or even just one of the women’s stories. Instead, it felt like she tried to cram too much into one novel, which didn’t fully work for me. That said, I genuinely enjoyed the first two sections.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciated the ambition and enjoyed parts of *Memory Piece*, particularly Giselle’s and Jackie’s sections, the book ultimately felt overstuffed and uneven. The dystopian future section lacked subtlety and character depth, detracting from the overall experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This book prioritizes atmosphere over a robust plot, centering on the experiences of three Asian American women—Giselle, Jackie, and Ellen—as they navigate technological and societal changes from the 1980s to around 2040. Giselle’s narrative stands out as the most engaging and thoughtfully developed, while Jackie’s storyline lacks excitement, and Ellen’s suffers from a disjointed time jump. Despite its potential, the book ultimately falls short in execution. It’s an average read that doesn't fulfill its promise.",
