Let’s call it speculative fiction and enjoy how weird it is.  \n- **Writing Style:** I’m obsessed with the fact that Pulley’s writing style is the same regardless of whether the book is set in the 1800s or the 2500s(?). It comforts me.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:** I’ve now read it twice, and I’m here to say I love it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is an unhinged fever dream that requires multiple reads to fully appreciate.

Its primary flaw is a superficial engagement with its themes. Beneath the surface-level condemnation of bigotry lies a troubling narrative that suggests racism can be justified and fascism has its merits. I don't believe the author intends to promote these ideas; rather, it seems she lacks a clear understanding of the implications of her work.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Publishing and Marketability:**  \n  I initially wondered why publishers didn’t eagerly pick up a Pulley book, but after reading *The Mars House*, I understand why UK publishers hesitated. It wasn’t just because it’s sci-fi; it’s because the book is incredibly incompetent and poorly executed to an embarrassing degree. Given how clumsily it engages with its central topics, I wouldn’t want it in my imprint either.  \n\n- **Expectations and Disappointment:**  \n  I started *The Mars House* with high hopes but ended up beyond disappointed—I was actively angry at the sheer stupidity of it while reading.  \n\n- **Handling of Sensitive Topics (Gender, Race, Colonialism):**  \n  Pulley often lacks tact when dealing with certain topics, especially gender, race, and colonialism. While I usually don’t dwell on this beyond an eye roll, this book is different. It explicitly tackles these subjects, and Pulley’s incompetence in handling them was so glaring that it left me wanting to scream off a mountaintop.  \n\n- **Character Development and Morality:**  \n  I don’t need characters to be paragons of moral virtue, but the passivity of everyone in this book was too much.  \n\n- **Use of Technology as Metaphor:**  \n  Using technology as a metaphor for social issues is common in sci-fi and usually an interesting method of exploration. The cages as a way to highlight inequality were initially intriguing—until they became a tool to suggest that oppression is good, actually. The main character wearing a cage around Gale 24/7 until Gale is comfortable rubbed me the wrong way. Thematically, it should have been about Jan actively confronting Gale’s bigotry, but I realized this isn’t that kind of book.  \n\n- **Themes and Underlying Messages:**  \n  This is ultimately a book about conservative policies and eugenics, handled with the kind of charming witticisms meant for historical fantasy, not nightmarish political scenarios. The book’s surface-level engagement with its themes is its main issue. Beyond the superficial “bigotry bad” message lies an underlying “racism can be justified” and “fascism is good” narrative. I don’t think this stems from ill intent on the author’s part—it’s simply because she doesn’t know what she’s doing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Mars House* was abysmal. Pulley’s incompetence in handling sensitive topics and the book’s problematic underlying messages left me deeply disappointed and angry. Pulley is no longer an auto-buy author for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "In this story, January, a former principal ballet dancer and Earthstrong refugee, embodies vulnerability beneath his physical strength. In contrast, Aubrey Gale, a politician pushing for forced naturalization, represents naivety and privilege. Their slow-burn relationship is both engaging and well-developed, adding depth to the narrative.",

The political dynamics within the Tharsis colony feel authentic, featuring a pro-independence party led by Gale and a pro-colonial faction represented by the current Consul. The crisis involving Earthstrong refugees and the Chinese government's efforts to reassert control add significant depth to the political intrigue. While I acknowledge the criticisms from Chinese readers regarding the representation of Asian people and cultures, I am not in a position to evaluate this aspect. The book also provided valuable insights into linguistics, though I remain mindful of the critiques.",

The ensemble cast features a diverse array of fun, deeply flawed, and outright awful characters, reflecting the complexity of human nature.",
            "This story features unique and imaginative world-building, effectively exploring how life on Mars diverges from that on Earth. The notion of fragile bones due to lower gravity and the use of cages for Earthstrongers is particularly intriguing. The societal structures and technological advancements, including the government system and solar power, are thoughtfully developed. Although some gravity-related concepts may lack scientific accuracy, they enrich the narrative and contribute to its depth.",

While the use of they/them pronouns and alterations of physical characteristics among the Mars people suggest a discussion of gender, it remains a secondary theme, serving more as a backdrop than a focal point."

Key themes include the miscommunication arising from the stark differences between Tharsis' gender-neutral culture and Earth’s gendered identity. The disparity in physical strength, rooted in the varying gravitational conditions, poses challenges for Earth arrivals. Additionally, January grapples with the costs and benefits of assimilation while navigating the risks associated with naturalization. The narrative delves into intricate political maneuvering among Tharsis politicians, highlighting the uneasy alliance between a Tharsis politician advocating for mandatory naturalization and January, who is striving to escape poverty and exclusion. Amid these tensions, the story hints at the potential for a difficult, budding romance.",

Their compelling enemies-to-lovers dynamic, intensified by a forced proximity storyline, allows them to bring out the best in each other. Gale reminds me of Lan Wangji from *The Untamed*, but set on Mars—no doubt about it! The well-developed secondary characters provide comedic relief and subtly hint at plot twists, enriching the story and beautifully complementing the main characters.",

It needed to be tested on multiple devices to ensure legibility before uploading to NetGalley.\n\n- **Genre and Themes:**  \n  *The Mars House* is a genre-bending sci-fi political work of art. It’s the most political novel in Natasha Pulley’s portfolio to date, offering an interesting reflection on the world we know today projected into the future. The book explores themes of strength, privilege, gender, and the give-and-take necessary to enact positive change while remaining hopeful. It’s a thought-provoking read that encourages self-reflection, even if it sometimes teeters on the edge of discomfort.\n\n- **Writing Style and Prose:**  \n  Natasha Pulley’s prose is masterful, and her ability to bring characters to life is unparalleled. Her writing has a distinct tone, grounded in meticulous research with a touch of the magical to keep it otherworldly. The use of footnotes to provide deeper insight into the world of Mars and January’s perspective was exceptionally well done. I now want footnotes in all her books!\n\n- **Main Characters:**  \n  January and Gale are phenomenal characters. January is lovable, a man stripped of his success who must rebuild his life from the ground up. His poignant sense of humor had me laughing aloud. Gale, initially an antagonist, evolves into a character I grew to adore. Their enemies-to-lovers, forced proximity dynamic was compelling, and they brought out the best in each other. Gale is like Lan Wangji from *The Untamed* but on Mars—no arguments there!\n\n- **Secondary Characters:**  \n  The secondary characters are strong and well-developed, offering comedic relief and subtle clues to the plot’s twists. They complemented the main characters beautifully and added depth to the story.\n\n- **World-Building and Technology:**  \n  The world-building is impeccable, with technology used to highlight society’s dependency on it and the potential detriments of over-reliance.

I don’t think I’m ever going to stop thinking about this book.  \n\n- **Author’s Approach to Themes:**  \n  Natasha Pulley trusts her readers enough to present difficult, controversial, even polarizing topics and not knock you over the head with the “right opinion”, which is where Babel failed for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Nuance:**  \n  I appreciated the nuance and the way certain things made me feel uncomfortable at times, enough to make me sit with my knee-jerk reactions and explore them. Also, her footnotes are Susanna Clarke level delightful.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  I’m a sucker for two idiots in love, and I will never tire of the way she writes them. Maybe one day we’ll be graced with a Pepperharrow-style love confession again, but I’m not complaining.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left a lasting impression on me, blending science fiction, nuanced themes, and delightful character dynamics.

            "In this novel, the queer romance, a recurring theme in the author’s works, was the least compelling aspect for me. The dialogue between January and Gale often felt awkward, leaving me questioning January’s attraction to Gale. Their connection seemed rooted more in loneliness than true compatibility. However, I was thoroughly engaged by the story, successfully predicting several clever plot twists. The narrative also addressed lingering questions, such as the fate of animals on Mars and the origin of their coffee, enhancing my enjoyment. The political storyline proved much more captivating than the romance. The author skillfully delves into the complexities of political compromises and moral ambiguity in a future where Earth is uninhabitable due to climate change and Mars grapples with anti-immigrant sentiment and resource shortages. January’s exclusion from Martian citizenship due to his “Earthstronger” status underscores themes of inequality and resource conflict.",
            "The world-building is vivid and captivating, with striking elements such as the profound consequences of the internet being turned off and the imaginative idea of 70-foot intelligent mammoths roaming Mars. However, certain details, like the use of water cannons on a water-rationed planet, are perplexing.",
            "I was curious to see how the author’s unique blend of whimsical and bleak elements would transition from historical fantasy to sci-fi in *The Mars House*. The setting, plot, and world-building captivated me, and her signature whimsy remained present throughout. However, the inclusion of sassy, editorial footnotes felt somewhat jarring."

It may not rival Kim Stanley Robinson’s *Mars Trilogy*, but it’s a fun and engaging addition to the genre.",

I found the setting, plot, and world-building fascinating, and the writing retained much of her signature whimsy, though the addition of sassy, editorial footnotes was jarring.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The queer romance, a common element in Pulley’s novels, was the weakest part of the book for me. The dialogue between the main characters, January and Gale, often felt cringe-worthy, and I didn’t understand what January saw in Gale. Their relationship seemed more driven by loneliness than genuine compatibility.  \n\n- **Political Plot and Themes:**  \n  The political plot was far more compelling than the romance. Pulley cleverly explores the complexities of political compromises and moral ambiguity in a future where Earth is uninhabitable due to climate change, and Mars struggles with anti-immigrant sentiment and resource shortages. The protagonist, January, faces exclusion from Martian citizenship due to his “Earthstronger” status, highlighting themes of inequality and resource conflict.  \n\n- **World-Building and Technological Details:**  \n  The world-building was vivid and engaging, with notable highlights like the profound impact of the internet being switched off and the imaginative concept of 70ft intelligent mammoths roaming Mars. However, some details, like the use of water cannons on a water-rationed planet, were baffling.  \n\n- **Plot Twists and Narrative Satisfaction:**  \n  I was gripped by the story and found it satisfying to predict several ingenious plot twists. The narrative also answered lingering questions, such as the fate of animals on Mars and the source of their coffee, which added to my enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Mars House* is a rich and effective allegory for inequality, resource conflict, and multiple axes of difference, wrapped in an exciting sci-fi thriller. While the romance subplot didn’t resonate with me, the political plot, world-building, and thought-provoking themes made it a compelling read. It may not rival Kim Stanley Robinson’s *Mars Trilogy*, but it’s a fun and engaging addition to the genre.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, framing these themes within a fake-dating romance feels incongruous and strange.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics and Romance:**  \n  The central romance involves an ultra-conservative politician who seeks to impose debilitating medical treatments on others.

The need for a happily-ever-after (HEA) ending means no one truly faces consequences for their actions, which undermines the gravity of the issues being explored.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Recommendations:**  \n  If you’re a fan of Natasha Pulley’s writing and her recurring theme of extreme power imbalances in relationships, I’d suggest exploring her other works instead. The Kingdoms and The Watchmaker of Filigree Street are stronger books with a more coherent perspective on attraction and moral ambiguity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile The Mars House attempts to tackle complex themes through the lens of a romance novel, the execution feels mismatched and unsatisfying.

Some problematic elements, particularly the right-wing politician's anti-immigration stance, remain unresolved by the conclusion.",

Nonetheless, his damaging views still hinder a complete understanding of his character. The romance between January and Gale is surprisingly gentle and kind, especially given Gale’s initial frosty demeanor and contentious political beliefs. Their evolving relationship adds depth to the narrative, although Gale’s opinions remain a notable challenge.\"",

While their evolving relationship feels genuine, it is somewhat hampered by unresolved issues related to their personal struggles with relationships and romance.",
            "The author's playful writing style, stemming from their transition from historical fiction to sci-fi, brings a refreshing energy to the genre. While the story unfolds slowly, the romance and tension keep it engaging despite its length. The plot is straightforward, featuring a predictable twist that is well foreshadowed. However, the strong character focus, particularly on January's experiences, adds depth and makes the narrative compelling.",
            "This book explores significant themes of morality, perspective, and the challenges of making impactful decisions. I appreciated how the character conflicts stem from societal and ethical dilemmas rather than personal vendettas. However, some themes, especially those concerning gender and identity, felt underdeveloped and lacked clarity.",
            "While I'm not typically a fan of sci-fi, the premise of this novel caught my attention. It’s a political sci-fi story incorporating the unique twist of a \"fake marriage\" romance, a rarity in the genre. The narrative is rich with thought-provoking ideas, such as the abolishment of gender and the evolution of Mandarin into a new dialect on Mars. Impressively, the book avoids the dry jargon that often hinders sci-fi, making it both accessible and engaging."

        "conclusion": "I enjoyed *The Mars House* for its unique premise, engaging characters, and exploration of moral and societal questions. However, I felt conflicted about its handling of gender and identity, which often flattened the complexity of these issues. While the relationship between the main characters was compelling, unresolved personal struggles and underdeveloped themes left me wanting more.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Genre:**  \n  I don’t usually enjoy sci-fi books, but I was intrigued by the premise of this one. It’s a political sci-fi novel that uses the romance 'fake marriage' trope, which I’ve never seen before. The book is packed with ideas, such as the abolishment of gender and the primacy of Mandarin as a language (and its evolution into a new Mars dialect). It avoids the dry explanations and terminology that often bog down sci-fi, making it more accessible and engaging.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  The writing felt playful, likely because the author has transitioned from historical fiction to sci-fi, giving the genre a fresh feel. The slow-burn romance and tension kept the story gripping, even though it was long. The plot itself was straightforward, with a main twist that was heavily foreshadowed and somewhat predictable, but the focus on characters, particularly January’s experiences, made it compelling.  \n\n- **Characterization and Perspective:**  \n  Most of the book is focused on January, an Earthstronger and outsider on Mars, which provides a unique perspective on the colony and its societal issues. The story delves into the complexity of the two main characters, January and Aubrey Gale, and their moral disagreements. Their evolving relationship is believable, though it’s hindered by unresolved issues around their personal struggles with relationships and romance.  \n\n- **Themes and Morality:**  \n  The book engages with big ideas about morality, perspective, and the difficulty of making decisions with far-reaching consequences. The conflicts between the characters are rooted in societal and ethical questions rather than personal grudges, which I appreciated. However, the handling of some of these themes, particularly around gender and identity, felt messy and underdeveloped.  \n\n- **Gender and Identity Representation:**  \n  The choice to make naturalised-to-Mars people agender, with gendered terms reserved for Earthstrongers and animals, was a major and stressful aspect of the book. As a non-binary person, I found it hard not to read into the author’s commentary on gender construction, which felt inconsistent and at times problematic. The removal of binary gender was sometimes framed as a negative effort to remove inequality, and the implications of this system weren’t fully explored. The book missed opportunities to address queer and trans experiences, both on Earth and Mars, and didn’t delve deeply into sexuality and romance in Tharsis, despite romance being central to the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI enjoyed *The Mars House* for its unique premise, engaging characters, and exploration of moral and societal questions. However, I felt conflicted about its handling of gender and identity, which often flattened the complexity of these issues. While the relationship between the main characters was compelling, unresolved personal struggles and underdeveloped themes left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

With compelling characters, a gripping plot, and inclusive themes, it’s a book I’ll undoubtedly read again.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n5 stars."

It started as early as page 2, with the main character fat-shaming someone who isn’t even fat. While I initially thought the author might be making a clever comparison between Earth and Mars experiences of weight and strength, the persistent fat jokes and associations with portliness and greed were problematic and hard to overlook.  \n- **Experiential Appropriation Trope:** The use of the trope where a white main character experiences something in a fictional world that POC experience in real life was another major concern. While it wasn’t as heavily relied upon as in other books I’ve read (e.g., *The Handmaid’s Tale*), it was still prominent in the beginning during the set-up and remained an annoying element throughout.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its strengths in world-building, characters, romance, and pacing, the novel was marred by issues of anti-fatness and the use of an experiential appropriation trope.

My initial misgivings didn’t subside; instead, they grew stronger as I read further. The anti-immigrant rhetoric and the portrayal of an agender society (which paradoxically still projected gender) felt out of place and ominous.  \n\n- **Prose and Style:**  \n  I genuinely adore Pulley’s prose and style. Her gentle way of introducing worlds and characters is something I appreciate. However, having that same style describe the unsettling rhetoric and societal constructs made the experience jarring.  \n\n- **Gender Representation:**  \n  As a nonbinary person, the way gender was introduced and projected on others didn’t sit well with me. The concept of 'agender' felt more like an erasure of the 'need' for gender rather than an embracing of all genders and identities. This left me feeling very uneasy, though I can’t fully articulate why.  \n\n- **Engagement and Completion:**  \n  I decided not to finish the book, stopping at 26% (Chapter 13). The discomfort I felt outweighed my appreciation for the writing style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I admire Pulley’s prose and storytelling style, the book’s ideology, rhetoric, and gender representation made me increasingly uncomfortable.

            "The science is simplified but presented in a way that enhances the story without being distracting. While this book feels more vibrant and entertaining compared to others by the same author, it does have some sluggish moments and may over-explain towards the conclusion.",
            "This story examines the fundamental theme of societal construction through the lenses of language, gender, and significant environmental shifts, such as those found on an alien planet. It thoughtfully delves into the experiences of individuals raised in a world dominated by implants and assisted functions, where the concept of a naturally developed human sense of direction may seem like a relic of the past.",
            "This is the most engaging book I've read in ages, meriting five stars despite its imperfections. I particularly appreciated the broad strokes of future politics, where Europe is portrayed as mere fringes of a dominant Chinese culture. The book resonated with my tastes through its British humor, clever language play, and the depiction of low-status individuals—those who underestimate their importance yet carry out essential tasks. While I've read other works by this author that didn't quite resonate, this one feels notably fresh and enjoyable. Despite its flaws, I will definitely be keeping an eye on her future projects."

The story intricately examines the complexities of immigration, highlighting the societal and physical ramifications of Earth's population relocating to Mars. It explores themes of strength, power, and the difficulties of integrating diverse groups, particularly focusing on the Earthstrong population, who are viewed as a potential threat because of their physical prowess.",

The whole book is filled with a deep love of linguistics and learning another language, and I’m just out here vibing with the entire concept of it.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  It explores themes like climate change, immigration, personal responsibility, and sacrifice. There’s also a romance woven into the story, which adds another layer of complexity.  \n\n- **Characters and Human Connection:**  \n  I love the characters, and I love that, like in all Pulley books, at the end of the day, it’s about human kindness in the face of horribly extreme circumstances.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is brilliant and insane, blending creativity, depth, and heart in a way that’s utterly captivating. Highly recommended!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This novel continues that trend, even with \"alien\" humans who have evolved into a very different species. It’s more fantastical than scientific, akin to *Translation State*, exploring the edges of what makes a person \"human\" and how to communicate across seemingly untraversable gaps.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The main mechanism for the big mystery was far too obvious. I figured it out by page 30, and it took the characters much longer to catch up, which made the reading experience frustrating. Many characters seemed overly oblivious, making them neither realistic nor bearable.  \n\n- **Characters and Representation:**  \n  I seem to have a different experience with Natasha Pulley’s characters compared to many reviewers. I love her female and feminine characters, and I disagree with the notion that writing a woman as unlikable, minor, or even evil is inherently misogynist.  \n\n- **Genre and Interpretation:**  \n  I read this novel not as allegorical sci-fi (commentary on current events) but as a \"let's build some rules into a world and see what happens\" thought experiment. It’s a variation of Pulley’s usual imaginative, fantastical take on history, moved into the future. I believe it takes significant contortions to read current social issues into it, and my interpretation would likely be the opposite of other reviewers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Natasha Pulley’s unique themes and imaginative world-building, the overly obvious mystery and oblivious characters detracted from my enjoyment.

Although some main characters display overt xenophobia, the narrative ultimately delves into the humanity of those with whom we disagree.

In such a polarized political world, it does a lot of good to consider that someone might have a different political view without actually wanting to hurt the people that they would hurt with legislation based on those views.  \n\n- **Execution and Writing Quality:**  \n  Did the author pull off the story she set out to tell?

            "January and Gale stand out as two of the author's finest characters—complex, endearing, and frustrating, yet thoroughly captivating. Their exploration as morally grey individuals challenges the norms of plot and character development, encouraging readers to engage thoughtfully with themes of morality and politics.",
            "I rounded up my rating to 4.75, despite a few instances of slightly repetitive phrasing. I would gladly see the entire publishing industry collapse for this author. As a non-native speaker of Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese, I can't fully evaluate the language representation. However, the author, who has lived in Japan and China for years and speaks both languages, skillfully explores the fluidity of language and its impact on social change, all while avoiding definitive statements about the nature of China.",
            "Israel is mentioned only once in this book, which was written well before the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The author could not have anticipated the current context. While the portrayal of an Israeli accent as “homely” may seem tone-deaf in light of recent events, it is unjust to hold the author accountable for developments that occurred after the writing. Furthermore, Pulley’s characterization of Bethlehem as a small town in the Middle East is a humorous nod to the novel’s timeline, set 3,000 years ago, when modern lore is sparse.",
            "This book's politics resonate with our current issues, igniting meaningful discussions about morality. Its powerful and thought-provoking ending (no spoilers!) leaves a lasting impact. The representation of gender and the exploration of a genderless society are groundbreaking; however, the decision to eliminate \"excessive gender traits\" raises some questions for me."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n  I rounded up from 4.75 due to a couple of passages with minutely repetitive phrasing. However, I would let the entire publishing industry collapse for Natasha Pulley.  \n\n- **Cultural and Historical Sensitivity:**  \n  Israel is mentioned only once, and it’s important to note that this book was written well before the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack. Pulley couldn’t have foreseen the current context. While the use of an Israeli accent as “homely” might feel tone-deaf now, it’s unfair to blame the author for events that occurred after writing. Additionally, Pulley’s description of Bethlehem as a small town in the Middle East is a joke rooted in the novel’s timeline, set 3000 years ago, where modern lore is sketchy.  \n\n- **Language and Representation:**  \n  As a non-native speaker of Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese, I can’t fully assess the language representation. However, Pulley lived in Japan and China for years and speaks both languages. She explores the mutability of language and its role in shaping social change, without making definitive statements about how China is.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  January and Gale are two of Pulley’s best characters—complex, loveable, hateable, and deeply compelling. The exploration of morally grey characters pushes the boundaries of plot and character development, prompting readers to think deeply about morality and politics.  \n\n- **Themes and Messages:**  \n  The book’s politics mirror our own, sparking meaningful discussions about right and wrong. The ending’s message is powerful and thought-provoking (no spoilers!). The representation of gender and the potential for a genderless society is groundbreaking, though the removal of “excessive gender traits” left me with some questions.  \n\n- **Non-Binary Representation:**  \n  Every character using they/them pronouns is consistently addressed and described with those pronouns. There’s even a moment where a character offers to share “the truth,” but neither the reader nor the other character asks for it—this is how non-binary representation should be done, without reducing it to gen*talia.  \n\n- **Memorable Moments:**  \n  The slow burn, the dog, Yuan, Swan Lake, the finger trailing across the glass, and the BATH!!! These moments are unforgettable and add to the book’s brilliance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is excellent. Natasha Pulley delivers complex characters, thought-provoking themes, and groundbreaking representation. Despite minor quibbles, it’s a masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.75 (rounded up)"

            "Gale is a problematic character, actively supporting genocidal laws against the Earthers, which makes it difficult to empathize with him. January, on the other hand, is a lackluster character, lacking depth and agency. His defense of Gale's actions feels unconvincing, further diminishing his character. The romance between Gale and January comes across as forced and lacks chemistry, relying solely on January's tendency to be drawn to those who show him kindness, which undermines their relationship.",

            "The worldbuilding in this story is underwhelming compared to the author's earlier works, which excel in historical fiction. The portrayal of gender raises more questions than it resolves, and the treatment of refugees is handled ambiguously. While the political and societal themes, influenced by Brexit and its effects on the NHS, are intriguing, they lack thorough development.",

            "The romance between January and Martian politician Aubrey Gale is a mixed bag. Initially, it feels goofy and unconvincing, with January fawning over Gale despite their political disagreements. However, it unexpectedly evolves into something more compelling. Still, the logic behind their high-profile political marriage never fully resonates. The novel begins strongly with an intriguing premise: January Stirling, a British man emigrating from a degraded Earth to Mars, finds himself in a society where Earthstrongers are viewed as a dangerous underclass. This inversion of the John Carter trope—where Earthborn individuals are typically seen as extraordinarily powerful in low gravity—adds a fresh and engaging twist.",
            "Aubrey Gale is a complex character, though some readers may find their initial depiction as a xenophobic fascist jarring, especially with the subsequent efforts to humanize them.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Concept:**  \n  The novel starts strong with an intriguing concept: January Stirling, a British man emigrating from a degraded Earth to Mars, encounters a society where \"Earthstrongers\" are treated as a dangerous underclass. This inversion of the John Carter trope, where Earthborn individuals are seen as extraordinarily powerful in low gravity, was fresh and compelling.  \n\n- **Genre and Tone:**  \n  Initially, the book seemed like a sci-fi story with a romance subplot, but it shifted toward being a full-on romance with sci-fi elements. The romance, at times, felt overly silly, with tropes like \"enemies to lovers\" and \"fake marriage\" that seemed more suited to fanfiction tags.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance between January and Martian politician Aubrey Gale was a mixed bag. While it started off as goofy and unconvincing (with January fawning over Gale despite political disagreements), it eventually became more compelling than expected. However, the in-universe logic of their high-profile political marriage never fully clicked.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Aubrey Gale is an interesting character, though some reviewers struggled with their initial portrayal as a xenophobic fascist and the subsequent attempt to humanize them. January, on the other hand, was less compelling initially, often coming across as overly infatuated with Gale. However, his character improved as he began to push back against Gale more assertively.  \n\n- **Themes and Subplots:**  \n  Despite the prominence of the romance, the book balanced it well with other elements, including political intrigue, a missing persons mystery, and an engineering battle against Mars itself. These layers added depth and kept the story engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has its flaws, particularly in the execution of the romance subplot, it does a lot of interesting things with its unique concept and layered storytelling. Natasha Pulley once again demonstrates her ability to make unconventional pairings compelling, and the book’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5 stars, rounding up."

The central issue revolves around the physical differences between Earth natives and Mars natives, with Earth natives being dangerous in Mars gravity and Mars natives being over 7 feet tall, making each party intimidating to the other.  \n\n- **Scientific and Cultural Elements:**  \n  As a geologist, I can’t speak to the scientific accuracy, but the physical differences due to gravity and the cultural and language barriers added layers of complexity. The original purpose of the Mars colony was to provide immigration options for Earth, but now, new refugees must either live in restrictive body cages or undergo a dangerous naturalization procedure.  \n\n- **Political Dynamics:**  \n  The political battle features two candidates: one who speaks with empathy but is corrupt, and another who is charming and brilliant but lacks empathy. This dynamic felt like a combination of Biden & Trump versus Obama & Musk, which was overwhelming.  \n\n- **Character Development (January):**  \n  January, a former ballet dancer forced to flee to Mars, became the heart of the story for me. His struggle, from working in a water plant to being imprisoned and caught in the political crossfire, kept me engaged. His situation became a focal point in the election, with both sides offering assistance in exchange for his cooperation.  \n\n- **Predictability and Engagement:**  \n  While January’s story saved the book for me, I found much of the ending predictable and considered putting it down multiple times.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel’s political complexity and scientific elements were overwhelming, but January’s personal journey provided a compelling anchor.

            "This novel marks a departure from the author's typical fantasy style, exploring a science-fiction setting. While she skillfully creates an otherworldly atmosphere with elements like floating gravity, talking mammoths, and misty solar power collectors, the need for scientific explanations sometimes falters. For instance, the portrayal of mist surrounding solar generators on arid Mars contradicts basic scientific principles, as warm air actually holds more moisture, not less. Although the world-building features intriguing concepts that enhance the plot, pacing, and tension, it frequently lacks scientific plausibility. The introduction of Harrison-Bergeron-like cages for Earthstrong individuals raises unexplained consequences, such as making falls more perilous despite their dense bones and strength. These inconsistencies undermine the overall credibility of the science-fiction framework.",

The author presents a nuanced political debate, showcasing valid arguments from both sides and steering clear of simplistic good-versus-evil dichotomies.

While she evokes otherworldliness effectively (e.g., floating gravity, talking mammoths, misty solar power collectors), the need to explain these elements within the constraints of the genre doesn’t quite work. For instance, the mist around solar power generators on arid Mars contradicts basic scientific principles, as warm air holds more moisture, not less.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n  The world-building contains evocative ideas that serve the plot, pacing, and tension but often lack scientific plausibility.

I like Pulley’s style, and she does provide some serious surprises.  \n\n- **Handling of Controversial Topics:**  \n  Given the somewhat controversial nature of the topic, you need to go in with a true trust-the-process mindset, as not all is as it seems.  \n\n- **Nuance and Depth in Storytelling:**  \n  There are elements of the story and thematic elements I felt could have been handled with a bit more nuance and delved into more deeply.  \n\n- **Portrayal of Gender and Society:**  \n  Pulley’s understanding of gender in society is tenuous at times. While the fully non-binary society makes for an interesting backdrop, it felt difficult to suspend my disbelief that a society would actually develop this way. It felt like an oversimplification of what gender means to people’s sense of self.  \n\n- **Parallels Between Gender and Earthstrong/Naturalized People:**  \n  The parallels between gender and Earthstrong/naturalized people felt tenuous at best and didn’t feel necessary to understand the Earthstrong conflict, which stands on its own. The culmination of the Earthstrong conflict felt a little underbaked.  \n\n- **Potential for Annoyance:**  \n  While these issues didn’t take away from my overall enjoyment of the story, I do see how they might prove more annoying for others.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some shortcomings in the handling of gender, societal development, and thematic depth, the novel delivered surprises and maintained my enjoyment, largely due to Pulley’s engaging storytelling style.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4 stars"

Based on the plot, the main character, January, and the love interest, Gale, shouldn’t even be together.  \n\n- **Character Motivations and Consistency:**  \n  Gale wants to force January and other refugees to undergo a dangerous procedure to naturalize to Mars' atmosphere, which January and the refugees oppose due to the potential loss of freedom and severe disabilities. This conflict is never resolved. Gale never changes their mind on the issue; they only back off because they can’t hurt January, but they don’t propose better solutions either.  \n\n- **Romance Dynamics:**  \n  January becomes so blinded by Gale’s charm that they stop caring about the political implications. Gale’s charm mostly comes from dialogue that feels forced and sitcom-like, such as, \"omg did that really just happen? Please don’t stab me with a pen, I’m innocent, haha.\"  \n\n- **Subplot Potential:**  \n  The most interesting subplot revolves around Gale’s ‘twin,’ whose background is explained in one chapter but is immediately killed off, leaving the potential unexplored.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has some intriguing elements, such as the setting on Mars and the subplot involving Gale’s twin, the overall execution falls short.

            "January Sterling and River Gale are an unlikely and tumultuous match. January possesses the power to crush River with a single touch, while River can dismantle January with just a word. Their marriage is a facade; they barely know each other, and their mutual disdain is palpable—January loathes River's beliefs, and River detests January's very essence. Yet, they are bound by this union. River is astutely intelligent, sharply perceptive, and, crucially, remarkably gracious, embodying a depth of care that is hard to comprehend for someone in their position. Aubrey Gale, while not a traditional woman in this narrative universe, is more than just a narrative foil to the central love story, though she ultimately falls into that role. No character since Grace Carrow has been explored with such thoughtfulness and nuance.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Writing Style and Tone:**  \n  Natasha Pulley's writing has a razor-sharp edge combined with warmth and wonder. The balance she achieves is delicate and unique, making her stories magical. The genre is secondary to the core of what makes her work compelling.  \n  - \"There is a razor-sharp edge, and an unbelievable warmth and wonder, to everything Natasha Pulley writes.\"  \n  - \"The genre was never important. And for the first time, the core of what makes her stories so magical feels like it has been (almost) fully realized.\"\n\n- **Character Dynamics and Relationships:**  \n  The power hierarchies and dynamics between characters are explicit and drive the plot. The relationship between January Sterling and River Gale is complex, fraught with tension, and deeply compelling.  \n  - \"January Sterling and River Gale are a terrible, impossible match. January could crush them (literally) with one touch, and Gale could crush them (figuratively, and absolutely) with one word.\"  \n  - \"The marriage was pretend, neither of them knew the other, he hated everything Gale thought and Gale hated everything he was—but they were married.\"\n\n- **Themes of Power and Fear:**  \n  The book explores different kinds of power, hierarchies, and the fear that comes with them. It questions how power should be wielded and who has the authority to restrict it.  \n  - \"Because this book is all about power. Different kinds of power, hierarchies of power, potential for power abuse versus actual power abuse, and what kinds of power can be wielded, and when.\"  \n  - \"What degree of fear gives us the right to restrict someone else's power? Who should be the authority on that?\"\n\n- **Character Development (River Gale):**  \n  River Gale is a standout character—sharp, intelligent, and impossibly gracious. Their care for others and their inability to understand why someone wouldn’t care is central to the story.  \n  - \"River is cuttingly sharp, world-changingly intelligent, and, most importantly, impossibly (for anyone in their position) gracious.\"  \n  - \"River Gale cares so much that they cannot even fathom why someone wouldn't.\"\n\n- **Themes of Love and Hope:**  \n  Love and hope are central to the story, driving the characters forward despite the uncertainty and challenges they face.  \n  - \"Love doesn't save the day, but it's the most important thing in the world. With love, and hope, people can roll up their sleeves and work towards something better.\"  \n  - \"Pulley love is knowing, slowly, and being known, and it is the kind of love story that is the most heartwrenchingly beautiful thing in the world.\"\n\n- **Character Development (Aubrey Gale):**  \n  Aubrey Gale is a deeply empathetic character, given thoughtful exploration, though they are ultimately relegated to a narrative foil.  \n  - \"Aubrey Gale is not a Pulleyverse woman in the traditional sense, they still succumb to the curse of being built up as so much more than a narrative foil to the central love story, only to be relegated to just that.\"  \n  - \"No one since Grace Carrow has been given more thoughtful and gentle exploration.\"\n\n- **Ending and Unresolved Questions:**  \n  The ending is bittersweet, with many loose ends left unresolved, reflecting the uncertainty of life and the need to live with it.  \n  - \"The ending is bittersweet at best, because all the loose ends from the beginning are still there, but, as is made clearer and clearer to both the characters and the readers, that is how it has to be.\"  \n  - \"A lot of things were left unfinished and unanswered at the end of this, some of them justified and thematically fulfilling, some of them not so much.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a profound exploration of power, fear, love, and hope, with deeply compelling characters and relationships. Natasha Pulley’s writing is as sharp and warm as ever, and while the ending leaves many questions unanswered, it is thematically fitting. This is, to date, my favorite book by Natasha Pulley.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

While I disagree with labeling Pulley as anti-immigrant or pro alt-right, the overtones in this book were troubling.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story started strong with a great opening 30%, but it became too long and convoluted, especially once the primary action moved to London. I couldn’t stay invested in the story despite liking the main character, January.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations:**  \n  As someone in the aerospace industry, I was intrigued by the science fiction elements and the creativity around Mars colonization. However, those seeking a swoony arranged marriage romance or satisfying political maneuverings will likely be disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I admire Natasha Pulley’s writing style and appreciate the complexity of her themes, *The Mars House* didn’t draw me in. The pacing faltered, the story felt overly long, and the portrayal of certain characters left me uncomfortable. Despite liking the protagonist, I couldn’t fully engage with the novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "January is a compelling character grappling with personal struggles, but the enemies-to-lovers plot feels forced. Gale lacks redeeming qualities; his obsession with demonstrating his political prowess overshadows potential depth. It takes over half the novel for any character redemption to surface.",
            "The premise is intriguing, with the first section set in a post-apocalyptic London being particularly engaging. The vivid details of the city captivated me, as did the characters’ struggle to survive rising waters. However, the transition to Mars felt overwhelming due to excessive world-building, which bogged down the plot with constant justification and unnecessary detail.",

        "conclusion": "While the novel had an intriguing premise and a strong opening in the apocalyptic London setting, the shift to Mars and the excessive world-building hindered the plot’s momentum. The characters, particularly Gale, lacked depth and redemption until late in the story. The themes and scientific details, though interesting, often detracted from the overall narrative.",

            "The political landscape is engaging, tackling a complex issue without straightforward solutions. Central to the narrative is the conflict between Earthborn and Mars-born individuals, particularly through laws proposed by Aubrey Gale that strip Earthborn of their bodily autonomy. A standout aspect is the evolving perspectives of January and Aubrey as they come to understand each other's viewpoints. However, the resolution hinges on predictable plot twists and questionable character decisions, which undermine the story's overall believability.",
            "The romance in this story is subtle and organic, steering clear of the sentimentality that often overshadows serious sci-fi narratives. This makes it an appealing choice for readers who typically shy away from romance, as it enhances rather than overwhelms the plot. The nonbinary identity of the Martians is a cultural aspect, with individuals born without genetic gender markers and primarily grown in vats. While this adds an intriguing layer to the worldbuilding, it doesn't quite fit the traditional notion of queer representation, as the Martians are alien and gender non-conforming rather than explicitly queer.",
            "The worldbuilding is impressive, presenting Tharsis as a richly developed Martian city that has undergone significant cultural and physical evolution over seven generations. The exploration of societal changes, including the absence of gender and religion, is thorough; however, the author does not endorse these policies, emphasizing their shortcomings. The scientific elements are accepted at face value, fostering intriguing dynamics and offering a fresh perspective on Earth’s future.",

It offers a fresh perspective on Earth's evolution in the face of climate change, positioning Russia, China, and Africa as emerging power centers while portraying the US as a nation of religious fanatics. The narrative is enriched by lessons on communication, including the fascinating concept of how mammoths converse, adding depth to the story."

The conflict between Earthborn and Mars-born individuals is central, with laws proposed by Aubrey Gale that remove bodily autonomy from Earthborn.  \n  - The shifting perspectives of January and Aubrey as they understand each other’s viewpoints are a highlight.  \n  - However, the resolution relies on expected plot twists and illogical character choices, which detracts from the story’s believability.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  - The worldbuilding is strong, with Tharsis as a well-developed Martian city that has evolved culturally and physically over seven generations.  \n  - The societal changes, such as the removal of gender and religion, are explored in depth, though the author doesn’t endorse these policies, highlighting their flaws.  \n  - The science elements are accepted at face value, allowing for interesting dynamics and a fresh perspective on Earth’s future.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  - The romance is understated and natural, avoiding the sappiness that can overshadow serious sci-fi narratives.  \n  - It’s a good choice for readers who don’t typically enjoy romances, as it complements rather than dominates the plot.  \n\n- **Representation and Identity:**  \n  - The nonbinary nature of Martians is a cultural choice, with people born without genetic markers for gender and most grown in vats.  \n  - While this is an interesting worldbuilding element, it doesn’t feel like queer representation in the traditional sense, as the Martians are portrayed as alien and gender non-conforming rather than queer.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a fascinating portrayal of a Martian colony with complex political dilemmas and rich worldbuilding. The understated romance and exploration of cultural change add depth, though the resolution of the plot falls short of its initial promise. It’s a thought-provoking read, particularly for fans of grounded science fiction and political narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- First half: 5/5  \n- Second half: 3/5  \n- Overall: 4/5"

            "The story opens with January losing everything in a flooded London and reluctantly accepting a move to Mars, where immigrants face second-class status. A political marriage proposal from Gale introduces a complex and addictive narrative rich with twists. Although the major secret is somewhat predictable, the plot remains engaging and emotionally resonant.",
            "The author masterfully crafts ambivalent yet deeply charismatic protagonists who evoke strong empathy, even when their actions are questionable. Gale, a xenophobic politician rumored to have murdered his younger brother and former fiancée, and January, a former ballet dancer turned laborer, exemplify this complexity. Their evolving relationship and shared experiences gradually transform their perspectives, culminating in an unexpected emotional connection. The romance between January and Gale is subtle yet powerful, forged through shared struggles and quiet moments rather than overt passion. The ability to convey profound emotion through a single longing glance or misunderstanding surpasses many more explicit romances.",
            "This book critiques discriminatory policies and the complexities of morality, illustrating how allies can still perpetuate evil while adversaries may act with goodness. However, the final message, which appears to villainize the Chinese, undermines the otherwise nuanced social commentary. Set in a genderless society on Mars, the novel delves into themes of discrimination, cultural clash, and societal norms. While the inclusion of mammoths and other surprising elements demands some suspension of disbelief, they ultimately enrich a fascinating and thought-provoking narrative."

I often found myself wanting to shake him, frustrated that he didn't express more anger about the plot's challenges—why not be a bit selfish and throw a fit like a normal person? He eventually does snap and gets into a fight, which had me glued to the pages, but it concluded in what I now recognize as the author's signature style. \n\nWhat I love about the author's romances is that they often read more like deep friendships.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  - I’ve always been a sucker for arranged marriage tropes as well as forbidden love tropes, and this book has both. The forbidden romance here is a REAL one—not just a casual “we shouldn’t be together,” but a “our interests cause direct and severe harm, personally, to the other, and we don’t see any way around it” kind of forbidden romance. It was so ever-looming that it gave me anxiety for much of the book.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - January is one of the most deeply empathetic characters I’ve ever read. I found myself wanting to shake him and yell about how this aspect of the plot definitely deserved some anger—why wouldn’t he be a bit more selfish and throw a fit about it like a normal person? He did eventually snap and get into a fight about it, which had me glued to the pages, but it ended in what I’m beginning to think of as classic Natasha Pulley fashion.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  - What I love about Natasha Pulley’s romances is that they could be mistaken for being about a friendship instead. She writes them like the development of a truly beautiful friendship—all about forming a deep bond, trust, and even admiration/respect for the other person. She makes me feel their love for each other without so much as a single mention of romantic desire. Even when the characters finally snap and fight about how they are fundamentally at odds, it ends gently and only serves to strengthen their bond.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n  - The author’s writing is far more character-driven than plot-driven. Not that there aren’t things happening, but she doesn’t rely on the cheap thrills of plot events to keep her readers engaged. The result is a book that feels like it has a slow pace, but I absolutely cannot put it down. It’s a refreshing feeling.  \n\n- **Ending and Sequel Potential:**  \n  - The ending, while complete, gave me hope for a sequel, so hopefully, there is more to come!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was everything I hoped it would be and more. I loved January, loved Gale, and loved their budding relationship so much. It’s a refreshing, character-driven story with a beautifully developed romance that feels like a deep friendship.

Additionally, the ending felt rushed and underwhelming, especially after the buildup of such significant drama.",

            "The plot was engaging, though some twists were predictable. The final three chapters felt rushed, leaving questions unanswered, particularly regarding Gale's reaction to January killing their twin and January's emotional response to the act. Additionally, the eventual conflict seemed somewhat contrived, as it could have been easily avoided if January had acknowledged the person in the orange jumper earlier.",
            "The evolving relationship between January and Gale is captivating, and the author masterfully captures the essence of longing. January's ongoing curiosity about Gale's intentions adds an intriguing depth to the narrative. What I appreciate most about this book—and the author's works in general—is the absence of clear heroes and villains. Instead, we encounter protagonists and antagonists with relatable and understandable motives, enriching the overall story.",
            "The exploration of language across all animal species, along with the technology of Tharsis, made for a captivating read.",
            "The book delves into several contemporary issues, including class systems, immigration, climate change, gender, and our reliance on social media. Although I believe some discussions could have been more thoroughly explored, I found the political elements to be quite compelling.",
            "This book invites diverse responses, particularly from readers of varying cultural and economic backgrounds. As a cis-white woman from the US, I recognize that my perspective may differ from others. I encourage readers to engage with and critique elements that I may not have questioned. It's possible to acknowledge a book's flaws while still enjoying it, or to dislike how certain issues are addressed yet appreciate the writing style.",

This approach made the book an utter delight, especially after hearing the author’s perspective in a recent interview.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The shifting dynamic between January and Gale was fascinating, and no one can pull off pining like Natasha. January’s constant wonder about Gale’s motives added a delicious layer to the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book explores a lot of contemporary issues—class systems, immigration, climate change, gender, and our dependence on social media. While I don’t think all these conversations were pushed as far as they could have been, I found the political aspects compelling.  \n\n- **World-Building and Technology:**  \n  The focus on language across all animal species (and language in general) and the technology of Tharsis made for a fascinating read.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The plot was engaging, though at times it was obvious what was actually going on. I found the last three-ish chapters rushed, leaving some questions unanswered, such as Gale’s reaction to January killing their twin and January’s emotional response to the act.  \n\n- **Conflict and Resolution:**  \n  The eventual conflict felt a bit ridiculous, as it could have been avoided had January acknowledged the person in the orange jumper at any point.  \n\n- **Character Morality and Depth:**  \n  What I loved about this book (and all the author’s works) is that there are no clear villains and heroes, but antagonists and protagonists with believable and understandable motives, making for a much richer story.  \n\n- **Reader Engagement and Critique:**  \n  With this Pulley book in particular, it’s important to recognize that readers from different cultural and economic backgrounds may respond in ways I didn’t. I want to see people engage with and critique aspects that, as a cis-white woman from the US, I may not have questioned. You can acknowledge a book’s flaws and still enjoy it, or despise the way issues were handled while appreciating the prose.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Mars House* was a delightful and thought-provoking read, despite some rushed moments and unresolved questions.

            "The story is quite predictable. While I enjoy the enemies-to-lovers trope, it falls flat here. It's evident that our strong, shy, and kind Thaniel will inevitably fall for the mysterious, powerful Mori with a soft heart. The reality TV angle feels excessive, and the reveal of the 'ghost' is painfully obvious. Additionally, the ending comes across as rushed.",
            "In this story, the characters feel like mere variations of the author's previous creations, particularly Mori and Thaniel, who echo Robin Hobb's Fitz and the Fool. The absence of female characters is striking—once again, the narrative lacks any significant representation of women. This raises questions about the author's choices, as she seems capable of deeper exploration. Additionally, the portrayal of Mars inhabitants as both sexless and genderless undermines the complexities of gender and sex, potentially aligning with TERF narratives. It's unclear if this was the author's intention.",
            "The writing style is, as always, exceptional. I particularly appreciate how she crafts her characters, embracing their quirks and making them truly unique.",
            "The sci-fi world-building is utterly nonsensical. While I have a fondness for the Mars mammoths, their presence is baffling. The science is flawed, the cage elements are confusing, and the resolution of these issues lacks coherence.",
            "This story touches on numerous political topics, including disability, gender, and parallels to the current refugee crisis, but none are explored with the depth they warrant. For instance, the portrayal of Bethlehem as part of Israel raises questions—it's located in Palestine. Is this intentional? Additionally, the presence of Russian elements in the narrative goes unexamined, with no mention of Ukraine. Why is this oversight present? It seems the author may not fully recognize the implications of these choices."

The resolve of this issue also made no sense.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  + I liked that they/them was used a lot for characters; I love non-binary characters.  \n  - All characters are just renditions of her other characters (Mori + Thaniel as the first ones) who are just renditions of Robin Hobb characters (Fitz & the Fool).  \n  - Pulley cannot or will not write any women. Again, another book with no women in it really. Why is that? I think Pulley is smarter than that.  \n  - Pulley destroys her post-gender society by forgetting that gender and sex are not the same. Making the Mars inhabitants all sexless and not only genderless plays into terf narratives. Not sure if that was her point.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story is pretty predictable.  \n  - While I love enemies to lovers as a trope, this doesn't work. It's crystal clear that our Thaniel-version (strong, shy, kind) is going to fall for the Mori-version (mysterious, powerful, soft heart).  \n  - The reality TV angle was a bit too much.  \n  - The resolve with the identity of the 'ghost' was SO obvious.  \n  - The ending felt rushed.  \n\n- **Themes and Political Commentary:**  \n  - Politically, lots of topics are addressed in this one, but none with the depth they deserve: be it disability, gender, or the parallels to today's refugee crisis. All feels plopped in.  \n  - Bethlehem is in Israel? UMMMMM. It's in Palestine! Is this on purpose too? Just like the tons of Russian in the novel and no mention (as far as I remember) of Ukraine? Why is that? How can she not see what she's doing there?  \n\n- **References and Easter Eggs:**  \n  + I liked the references to the other Pulley characters, even though she put it on thick (tone it down, come on!).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI feel like this could've been such a good novel, but as of now, it's all over the place, and the majority of stuff just made me mad. I thought Pulley knew and could do better. Oh well.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5-3 stars because parts were enjoyable, and I just love how she writes, even if it makes little sense."

Gale, however, felt truly genderless.  \n  - The story swept me up with its characters and ideas, though some parts were predictable and others less well-executed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Mars House* is my favorite read of the year so far. Despite some predictable moments and uneven execution, I absolutely loved the book as a whole for its innovative ideas, compelling characters, and engaging themes.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I appreciated the foundation of this story and found its political themes highly relevant. However, the pacing was a challenge; it took me three days to get through the first 30%, while I finished the rest in just one day. Once I overcame the slow and repetitive beginning, I was able to engage with the narrative more fully. Although there are intriguing twists that enhance the reading experience, the sluggish start and predictable plot points ultimately made it feel drawn out.",
            "In \"January,\" the immigrant protagonist navigates a challenging existence, confined to a literal body-cage and expected to be grateful while mastering three languages at the bottom of society. His resentment towards the naturalized citizens of Mars is palpable. One of the standout elements of the story is the contrast between January and Gale, as it’s rare to see a strong, white male portrayed as a refugee. This dynamic adds depth to the narrative and enriches the exploration of identity and belonging.",
            "I encountered significant issues with the footnotes while reading on my e-reader. Frequently, they would appear pages later, disrupting the flow of the story with red text. Additionally, the footnotes were often placed randomly in the middle of pages or at the end of chapters, rather than at the bottom or top. While I understand this is a publisher issue rather than an author one, it was still quite frustrating.",
            "The naturalized citizens of Mars, often descendants of families who have lived there for generations, have adapted to the low gravity and developed a unique language—a modified form of Mandarin. January finds herself immersed in a world of immense wealth, yet starkly unaware of the struggles faced by the Earth's overpopulated inhabitants.",
            "I genuinely hope that \"gays in space\" evolves into a new sub-genre, as I would wholeheartedly support it. The central narrative of the story evokes the essence of *West Side Story*."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Theme:**  \n  - I really hope gays in space are becoming a new sub-genre because I could definitely get behind that.  \n  - The main part of the story is like *West Side Story*.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - I loved the bones of this story and found the politics to be incredibly relevant.  \n  - This book was too slow for me, though. It took me three days to get through the first 30% and one day to finish it.  \n  - Once I got past that first third, I could just plow right through, but the first part was dull and repetitive.  \n  - There are some twists and turns that make this an interesting read, but the slow start and somewhat obvious plot points made it drag for me.  \n\n- **Characterization and Relationships:**  \n  - January, the immigrant, is trying to make the best of a bad situation. He's expected to not only be grateful to live in a literal body-cage most of the time but also know at least three different languages while living at the bottom of society.  \n  - Of course, he has anger towards the naturalized citizens of Mars.  \n  - The dichotomy of January and Gale was one of my favorite parts of this book. It's not often we see the strong, white, male be the refugee.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  - The naturalized citizens of Mars are often people whose families have lived on Mars for generations, and as such, their bodies have better adjusted to the low gravity, and they've developed their own language, a sort of modified Mandarin.  \n  - January is sucked into a world of unimaginable wealth and also ignorance of how the Earth strong population lives.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Formatting:**  \n  - I had a major issue with footnotes. I find this is a problem a lot when you're using an e-reader. Several times the footnote wouldn't continue until pages later, often with red text just interrupting the flow of the story.  \n  - Also, the footnotes weren't at the bottom or top of the page, but either randomly in the middle of pages or at the end of chapters. I know this isn't an author issue, but a publisher problem. It was still incredibly annoying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the political plot and the unique dynamic between January and Gale, which kept me engaged.

            "January, the principal dancer of London’s Royal Ballet, serves as a compelling protagonist. His fight for survival on Mars, his defiance against the perilous “naturalization” process, and his reliance on his physical prowess as a dancer enrich his character. Senator Aubrey Gale, an elite politician spearheading an anti-immigration campaign, is equally nuanced, transforming from a political foe to a partner in a marriage of convenience.",

The societal structure and cultural dynamics of the Martian colony are both well-developed and thought-provoking. Set in a future where Earth has been flooded due to climate change, the story follows January, the protagonist, as she navigates life in Tharsis, a Chinese colony on Mars that serves as a refuge for climate refugees. The low-gravity environment creates a societal divide between \"Earthstrongers\" (newcomers from Earth) and \"Natural people\" (those born and acclimated to Mars).",

I particularly enjoyed the quirky elements, like an artificial intelligence transporting a cat in a bucket. The idea of communicating with a mammoth through brainwaves was especially intriguing. The novel effectively explains the terraforming of Mars, detailing how a livable atmosphere and permanent population were established. I also appreciated that the story steers clear of the typical spaceship confinement cliché.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  The Mars House is a sci-fi novel set in a future where Earth has suffered a climate catastrophe, and settlers have established a colony on Mars. The story follows January, a ballet dancer turned refugee, who becomes entangled in political intrigue after a public disagreement with Martian Senator Aubrey Gale. This leads to an arranged marriage between the two, driving the narrative forward.  \n\n- **Genre and Style:**  \n  The novel blends sci-fi with literary fiction, drawing comparisons to KM Szpara's *Docile* and Everina Maxwell's *Winter's Orbit*. The heavy-handed messaging and transparent plot twists are reminiscent of *Docile*, but these elements worked well for me, as the parallels to real life were impactful.  \n\n- **Characterization and Representation:**  \n  I appreciated the queerness represented in the Martian agender society, particularly through Gale, who is agender. The exploration of different forms of strength and the linguistic details added depth to the characters and world-building. However, the emotional distance between the reader and the characters, especially Gale and January, slightly detracted from my connection to them.  \n\n- **Themes and Messaging:**  \n  The novel tackles themes of political maneuvering, societal strength, and the consequences of human actions. While the messaging was heavy-handed, it remained effective due to its clear parallels to real-world issues.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed *The Mars House* and found its blend of sci-fi and literary fiction compelling. The representation, world-building, and thematic depth were highlights, though the emotional distance from the characters kept me from giving it a full 5 stars. I look forward to exploring Natasha Pulley's other works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n4.5/5"

The intricate dynamics of this colony and its political factions are captivating, yet they serve primarily as a backdrop to the emotional core of the story.",

The complexity of this colony and its political factions is fascinating, though it serves as a backdrop to the emotional story.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  In every book by Natasha Pulley, I fall in love with her protagonists. The people she invents are fully human, with complex characteristics, memories, foibles, and passions.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The Noble House of Gale, a powerful family battling for the Consulship, controls the colony’s electricity supply and vast wealth.

            "January, the protagonist, embodies a wonderfully British charm, and his character arc is deeply rewarding. Observing him adapt to his unusual new life, forge connections with House Gale’s staff through witty banter, and experience love is both bittersweet and engaging. His growth, especially in standing up for others despite the power imbalance with Senator Gale, is particularly compelling.",
            "The setting was strikingly realistic, depicting the gradual encroachment of floodwaters in London and parts of the United States ablaze. This made the envisioned future feel entirely plausible. The Martian society, founded on the principle of No Gender, and the conflict between Naturals (Martian-born) and Earthstrongers (Earth refugees) provided a compelling and thought-provoking narrative.",

It was easy to imagine this as a plausible future. The Martian society, built on the principle of No Gender, and the conflict between Naturals (Martian-born) and Earthstrongers (refugees from Earth) was both juicy and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Research and Detail:**  \n  As a novice writer, I’m in awe of the amount of research and effort that must have gone into this book. The depiction of the environment and technology on Mars was impressive, but what I loved most was the linguistics aspect, especially as a polyglot.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  January, the protagonist, is wonderfully British, and his character arc is deeply rewarding. Watching him settle into his strange new life, bond with House Gale’s staff through banter, and fall in love was bittersweet. His growth, particularly in standing up for others despite the power imbalance with Senator Gale, was compelling.  \n\n- **Plot and Twists:**  \n  The twist took me by surprise and worked exceptionally well for the story. The culminating event of the book showcased the growth in January and Gale’s relationship, leaving me emotionally moved and ready to cry.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Attachment:**  \n  I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to characters like Songshu, House Gale, January, or even the mammoths. The emotional depth of the story made it hard to let go, and I’m already debating whether to re-read it immediately.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel left a lasting impression on me with its realistic world-building, meticulous research, and deeply emotional character arcs.

The enforcement of gender neutrality, where expressing gender is punishable, feels uncomfortable and not fully explored. The discussion often comes through Gale, whose opinions are easily dismissed as far-right. The concept is treated as a running joke rather than a significant plot point, which undermines its potential depth. As a non-binary person, the idea of enforced gender neutrality feels restrictive rather than freeing. The book could have delved deeper into this concept instead of using it as a backdrop for other conflicts.  \n- **Predictability:** The twin swap twist was guessed about a hundred pages before the reveal but dismissed as too implausible.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel is fun and engaging, with strong worldbuilding and compelling characters.

            "As a long-time fan since *The Watchmaker of Filigree Street*, which was one of my favorite reads upon its release, I've found that the author's subsequent works haven't quite resonated with me in the same way. However, her latest offering intrigued me, even though it explores a different territory. While the familiar whimsy and affection for wildlife remain, this book boldly ventures into the realm of space.",
            "The story unfolds in an uncertain future where Earth is devastated by fire, flood, and war. Centered in London, we follow January Stirling, a principal ballerina, as she witnesses the catastrophic effects of severe flooding. Following an evacuation, January faces a pivotal choice: to emigrate to a colony on Mars. This decision, made in haste and without a complete understanding of its implications, arises from her perception that there are no better alternatives.",
            "In \"January on Mars,\" the harsh realities of immigrant life are vividly portrayed. Earthborn individuals, or Earthstrong, possess a strength that poses a risk to naturalized or Mars-born citizens, leading to the requirement that they wear cages or face naturalization. The narrative thoughtfully examines complex themes such as immigration, the ethics of turning away those in need, as well as greed, gender, and cultural differences.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Author's Style and Evolution:**  \n  I’ve been a fan of Natasha Pulley since *The Watchmaker of Filigree Street*, which was one of the best books I read in its year of publication. While her later books didn’t quite resonate with me as much, this latest offering did, though it hit a different mark entirely. Pulley’s signature whimsy and love for wildlife are still present, but this book takes a bold new direction by venturing into space.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The story is set in the future, though I’m not entirely clear how far ahead. Earth is in a dire state, ravaged by fire, flood, and war. The narrative begins in London, where January Stirling, a principal ballerina, witnesses catastrophic flooding. After evacuation, January is offered the chance to emigrate to a colony on Mars, a decision made without fully understanding what it entails but seeing no better alternative.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  On Mars, January discovers that life for immigrants is far from ideal. Earthborn individuals, or \"Earthstrong,\" are significantly stronger than naturalized or Mars-born citizens, posing a risk of unintentional harm. To mitigate this, Earthborn must wear cages or risk naturalization. The book delves into complex themes such as immigration (can you turn away those with nowhere else to go?), greed, gender, and cultural differences and similarities. While these questions are thoughtfully explored, the narrative often leaves them unanswered, inviting readers to reflect.  \n\n- **Plot and Characters:**  \n  The story weaves together a fairytale romance and unexpected elements like giant mammoths, creating a unique and engaging narrative. January Stirling is a compelling protagonist, and the challenges faced on Mars add depth to the plot.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel combines Pulley’s signature whimsy with a bold new setting and thought-provoking themes. While it leaves some questions unanswered, it’s a captivating read that blends romance, social commentary, and imaginative elements like giant mammoths.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Scientific Rigor and Cultural Implications:**  \n  I appreciate how the book takes the science of space settlement very seriously, including its cultural implications, while still maintaining a strong focus on the characters and plot. Natasha Pulley has successfully balanced these elements, which is a rare achievement in science fiction.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Impact:**  \n  I was deeply affected by the scene where the ballet dancer, January Stirling, is placed in a movement-restriction cage. This moment reminded me of *Harrison Bergeron*, but with a more socially justified rationale, making it even more poignant.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  The book reminded me of Ian McDonald's moon trilogy, particularly *New Moon*, in its serious treatment of celestial bodies. However, this novel stands out with its unique approach to Mars. Additionally, while reading this, I started *A City on Mars*, a non-fiction book that offers a more pessimistic view of space settlement, yet its assumptions align somewhat with this novel’s themes.  \n\n- **Author’s Departure from Previous Works:**  \n  As Natasha Pulley mentions in the afterword, this book is a departure from her usual historical novels. Despite this shift, I found it equally compelling and would encourage readers to embrace this new direction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a rare gem in science fiction, blending rigorous scientific exploration with rich character development and emotional depth. Natasha Pulley’s departure from historical fiction to this space-themed narrative is a success, offering a thought-provoking and engaging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It’s almost impossible to explain without forgetting some important detail.  \n\n- **Themes and Exploration:**  \n  The book delves into power and hegemony, but not in the context of race or colonialism, which is unusual for Pulley, as she often explores those tensions. Instead, the focus is on the divide between Mars-born individuals (referred to as “natural” and agender) and Earth-born individuals (called “Earthstrong” and gendered). The society on Mars is depicted in a very black-and-white manner—either you’re “natural” or “Earthstrong,” either you’re wealthy or stateless and struggling.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  Despite the complex plot, the society Pulley creates on Mars feels flat and lacks depth.  \n\n- **Allegorical Interpretation:**  \n  Halfway through the book, it struck me that Mars could be an allegory for Taiwan. I’m not sure if this was intentional, but it’s an interesting thought.  \n\n- **Author’s Writing Style:**  \n  I LOVE Natasha Pulley and think her writing is genuinely some of the most beautiful and compelling stuff out there.

While I’m unsure of the scientific plausibility, the explanations seemed believable and made sense.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The core of the book revolves around political intrigue, with two opposing camps debating whether Mars, now seven generations old and home to greatly modified humans, should remain a colony of Earth or become independent. This debate is tied to the survival of the \"Naturals\" of Mars, as newcomers from Earth, who are much stronger, pose a physical threat to them. The main character, January, inadvertently becomes a media figure and ends up married to one of the Senators leading this political debate.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  January, a Royal Ballet dancer forced to flee Earth after London sinks, is a compelling protagonist. His journey and involvement in the political and social dynamics of Mars add depth to the story.  \n\n- **Social and Cultural Concepts:**  \n  A fascinating aspect of the novel is the abolition of gender on Mars. Biological sex is private, known only to the individual and their doctor. No one identifies as male, female, or anything else; they are referred to as \"they.\" Only newcomers from Earth exhibit and identify by gender traits, creating an interesting cultural contrast.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI greatly enjoyed *The Mars House* for its immersive world-building, thought-provoking political themes, and unique social concepts.

The sheer amount of DETAILS that went into making this a perfectly water-tight setting is one of the reasons why Natasha Pulley is da boss. DA BOSS.  \n\n- **Plot and Surprises:**  \n  There is SO much to say about this book, yet I feel like I don't need to put it all down here. I was perfectly happy going into it without any pre-conceived ideas or having read anything other than the summary, which didn't make much sense to me at the time anyway. Best to keep it a surprise. Because there WILL BE SURPRISES.  \n\n- **Resolution of Key Elements:**  \n  The whole cages thing was... unresolved at best. I was sure that by the end of the book they were going to be eliminated or at least hinted at that. But like... no? January still has to go to sleep in a cage? I mean, just HOW much better would the ending have been if instead of staring at the marks of his cage on Gale's chest when they wake up together, he marvels at how there AREN'T any marks and thus hinting that he has no more use for those cages? And putting Yuan in a cage was kind of a dick move too. Not impressed with that resolution at all.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Commitment to the Author:**  \n  This was a pleasure to read, and it has reaffirmed my determination to read everything Natasha Pulley ever writes. I bought the hard copy, ebook, and audiobook.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some unresolved elements, the book’s incredible world-building, surprising plot, and overall enjoyment make it a standout read. It has solidified my admiration for Natasha Pulley’s work.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nFive stars."

The notes included in the book are humorous and add to the experience.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The characters are not fully described, allowing readers to form their own mental images.

The pacing allows characters to take their time getting to know each other, which feels natural and engaging.  \n\n- **Themes and Subplots:**  \n  The novel tackles serious issues such as gender assumptions, immigration, political coups, economic struggles, internet overconsumption, colonial cities, and climate change. These themes are explored as subplots, offering a rich and layered narrative.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  The story is set on Mars and reflects political conflicts reminiscent of those witnessed on Earth in the last decade. The inclusion of Polar Bears and Mammoths adds a unique and intriguing touch to the world-building.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a gripping and thought-provoking SciFi novel that immerses readers in a complex, politically charged world on Mars.

I don’t think she has a firsthand account of these things necessarily, so some parts came off as kind of shallow.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Cultural Representation:**  \n  She seems to be in the linguistics field and a Mandarin speaker, so the use of Mandarin in worldbuilding seems solid; but that does not necessarily reflect Chinese culture, so basing things in the future on Mars was an appropriate choice.  \n\n- **Scientific Elements:**  \n  I enjoyed the science around living on Mars. I did a project with students last year where we imagined some problems with living on Mars and engineered solutions. I was happy to see Pulley came up with some of the same ideas. We didn’t come up with terraforming using mammoths and polar bears though.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Execution:**  \n  The plot was among the strongest and also weakest aspects. Some things were overexplained or not necessary as a full narrative (like the beginning, pre-Mars). I predicted some plot twists but others took me by surprise. Some of the plot-necessary motivations felt unlikely and evil, even though the political message was about nuance and separation of politics and person.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was okay. Fake marriage trope. The middle development of the relationship was my favourite part of it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I had mixed feelings about this novel.

The world-building felt weak upon closer scrutiny, and the plot didn’t go where I expected. It’s my least favorite Natasha Pulley book, though I still appreciate her writing style and wit. I hope her next book is stronger.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

It was a very entertaining story most of the time.  \n\n- **Cultural Representation:**  \n  The portrayal of Chinese culture in the novel felt inadequate. Tharsis, described as a Mandarin-speaking society, didn’t authentically feel Chinese, as highlighted in other reviews (e.g., Laura’s review and the ones she links to).  \n\n- **Themes and Ambitions:**  \n  The novel attempts to tackle multiple complex themes, including immigration/refugees, colonization, and environmentalism. However, it ends up addressing many of these inadequately.  \n\n- **Genre Blending:**  \n  The story blends multiple genres, such as romance, political thriller, mystery, and hard science fiction. While it doesn’t succeed in all of these (hard SF being the least successful), it still manages to create an engaging narrative.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The protagonist, January, a ballet dancer and \"Earthstronger,\" faces societal prejudice on Tharsis, where immigrants like him are viewed as threats due to their physical strength. This dynamic adds tension but could have been explored more deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a 3.5-star read for me.

There were good bits here and there (the mammoth section was kind of interesting) but a lot of it didn't work for me.\n- **Characterization:** I didn't find January and Gale's characterization to be very strong. I didn't understand how January went from absolutely hating Gale to accepting the marriage and pretty willingly doing all the \"political\" work at the Gale House.\n- **Romance Development:** The romance build-up was also so weak. Erm..stockholm syndrome??\n- **Dialogue:** And was it just me...or do some dialogue feel clunky and weird?\n- **Conflict Resolution:** Also, I found that the resolutions for some of the political issues and conflicts were too simple and unsatisfying.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  I couldn't get past the basic premise of the story. The idea of Earth people being placed in exoskeleton cages on Mars to prevent them from accidentally harming the fragile Martians felt illogical to me. My immediate thought was that Martians would encounter rocks or steel walls more often than Earth people, so the premise didn’t hold up. I also questioned how Martians would handle everyday actions like dealing with ice in their drinks, pressing buttons, or sitting on solid surfaces.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I was waiting to connect with January, the protagonist, a London ballet dancer who becomes a refugee after the city floods and takes a transport to Mars for a new chance. However, the premise overshadowed my ability to engage with his story.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Expectations:**  \n  I generally enjoy Natasha Pulley’s whimsical, strange, and tragic work, even though she has her flaws. This book, however, didn’t meet my expectations due to its unconvincing premise.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate Natasha Pulley’s unique storytelling style, the implausible premise of this novel made it difficult for me to connect with the story or the protagonist. The concept of Earth people in exoskeleton cages on Mars felt inconsistent and hard to believe, ultimately detracting from my enjoyment of the book.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In both instances, it often leads to stereotypes that reflect the authors' desires rather than authentic representations.",

The storyline feels predictable, especially for those familiar with earlier books. I hope the next installment introduces new main characters, as this one felt like a rehash of previous stories, which share too many similarities.",

The exploration of gender issues adds to the confusion, suggesting a lack of understanding of their complexities. Similarly, the treatment of cultural topics comes across as superficial.",

This part feels unnecessary and disrupts the flow compared to the rest of the book.  \n\n- **Themes and Intrigue:**  \n  The political intrigue between House Song and House Gale, the relationship between Mars' government and Earth, and the treatment of Earth’s climate refugees on Mars are far more compelling than the mystery surrounding Gale’s personal life before January.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential:**  \n  This is my first Pulley novel, and I liked it well enough that I will check out other works by the author.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its minor flaws, this is a strong sci-fi novel with engaging characters and intriguing themes.

I think the author just has lots of ideas and no way to execute them, plus a dollop of showing off her degree in presumably languages and nerding out.  \n\n- **Predictability and Ending:**  \n  I see the criticisms, but I really liked it anyway. Even when I saw the twist ending from 10 miles out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its flaws, including problematic themes and predictable twists, *The Mars House* captivated me with its beautiful prose, creative world-building, and unique ideas. Natasha Pulley’s writing style remains a draw for me, even when the execution of her concepts feels uneven.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Every time I finish one of Natasha Pulley's books, I have to read it again immediately and revisit all her other works to ease the separation anxiety. The same holds true for *The Mars House*.  \n\n- **Character Attachment:**  \n  I don’t always like the characters, but I am immediately attached to them. Despite their flaws, I find myself deeply invested in their journeys.  \n\n- **Plot and Rhetoric:**  \n  I find many aspects of the plot and rhetoric problematic, yet I can’t put the book down. It’s deeply uncomfortable, but I somehow can’t get enough of it.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  There are fundamental flaws in the world-building that should affect the plausibility of the plot. However, these issues are overshadowed by my emotional engagement with the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Morality:**  \n  The novel attempts to explore morality, human nature, and the real-world problems arising from climate change. However, it ends up propagating problematic tropes around refugees. Despite this, the part of my brain that is bothered by these issues is busy falling in love with the characters.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you enjoyed *The Kingdom* and *The Half Life of Valerie K*, you will probably also enjoy *The Mars House*. If you haven’t read any Natasha Pulley, start with *The Watchmaker of Filigree Street* and continue from there.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *The Mars House* has its flaws, particularly in its world-building, themes, and problematic plot elements, it remains an addictive and emotionally engaging read.

The author acknowledged alternative perspectives through the mammoth grandmother, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Presentation:**  \n  - I enjoyed the linguistic facts scattered throughout the novel and found the footnotes to be a nice touch.  \n  - However, I felt the editing was sloppy, as some contradictions in the text were left unresolved.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  - The enemies-to-lovers trope felt far-fetched, especially given the protagonist’s sudden transition from potential criminal to spouse of an aristocratic politician.  \n  - Two entire chapters dedicated to redundant flashbacks disrupted the pacing and felt unnecessary.  \n  - The twist was predictable, which diminished its impact.  \n\n- **Characterization and Romance:**  \n  - The romance subplot felt a bit too young adult (YA) for my taste, lacking the depth I expected.  \n\n- **World-Building and Creativity:**  \n  - I loved the inclusion of mammoths, which added a unique and imaginative element to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had many strengths, particularly in its thematic exploration and creative world-building.

If 1 in 250 immigrants were causing harm annually, it would justify addressing the problem, but this undermines the irrationality of racism and xenophobia.  \n\n- **Character Development (January):**  \n  I appreciated that January wasn’t portrayed as overly brave and instead sought options to ensure his safety. However, I disliked how permissive he was of cruelty, both in action and in thought. When faced with cruelty, January simply allowed it, rationalizing it by understanding people’s fear. While understanding and empathy are valuable, they are ineffective without accompanying action.  \n\n- **Political Commentary:**  \n  The novel effectively highlights the dichotomy between politicians’ actions and words, which I found compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n- **Readability:**  \n  Despite its thematic flaws, the book is very readable and engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel is readable and offers interesting character dynamics and political commentary, its metaphor for racism/xenophobia falls short by justifying these issues.

I couldn't help but envision Gale as Lan Zhan from *MDZS*, especially when he sported a white ribbon in his hair—I may have lost it a little at that moment.

The relationship between the main characters (MCs) plays a bigger part in the story, which I really enjoyed.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The book checked all my boxes, especially with the dynamic of an MC with little to no self-esteem meeting an MC with too much self-esteem.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I literally could not put it down.

However, it remains an entertaining read despite this lack of subtlety.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot Resolution:**  \n  I’m concerned that some poor reviews may have been left without the entire book being read. The final quarter of the book provides explanations for many of the characters’ actions and decisions, which adds depth and clarity to the story.  \n\n- **Accuracy and Misinformation:**  \n  One review mentioned Bethlehem being in Israel, so I specifically looked for that while reading. In my UK hardback copy, the only mention of Israel was that Tel Aviv was the capital. I wanted to clarify this misinformation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite its lack of subtlety and some on-the-nose themes, the novel is an entertaining read. The final quarter of the book provides important explanations for character actions, which may have been missed by some reviewers. Additionally, I found no evidence in my copy to support the claim about Bethlehem being in Israel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

However, the underdeveloped romance and the inclusion of difficult political and societal themes, such as anti-immigrant fear and a likable fascist character, may make it a divisive read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Set in a dystopian future plagued by environmental and geopolitical crises—London submerged, the US ablaze, and war raging between Russia and America—the story follows January, a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet. After a devastating flood forces her to flee, she is given the opportunity to escape to Mars. There, tension brews between Earth-born humans (Earthstrongers) and the native Mars-born (Naturals), who are evolving to adapt to their new environment. The narrative centers on an impending election, with one faction advocating for refugee acceptance while the other pushes for the Earthstrongers to undergo a life-altering naturalisation process. The story poignantly examines themes of responsibility, nationalism, and the intersection of personal and political conflicts.",
            "This book employs the classic Fake Relationship trope, a staple of romance fiction. The dynamic between January and the senator is intricate, filled with both physical and emotional risks. On Mars, gendering individuals is considered impolite, and all Naturals are referred to as \"they.\" Their appearance is intentionally gender-neutral, having been genetically modified to eliminate human sexual dimorphism. This choice prompts intriguing reflections on how readers interpret characters through the lens of their own socialization. While some reviews claim the author intentionally excludes women to avoid accusations of misogyny, I find this perspective somewhat misleading; the gender-neutral presentation does tend to default to a male perspective. Additionally, the book places a notable emphasis on weight, which I believe reflects January's background as a ballet dancer rather than the author's personal views. Ballet dancers often grapple with unique and sometimes unhealthy attitudes toward their bodies and diets.",
            "I adore the author's writing and will eagerly read anything she produces. Although she identifies as a historical fiction writer, her work frequently incorporates strong sci-fi elements, highlighting the limitations of genre classifications. This book is undeniably sci-fi, enriched by a swoon-worthy queer romance that is a signature aspect of her storytelling.",
            "The worldbuilding is impressively crafted, featuring intriguing elements such as mammoths and the linguistic evolution on Mars, where Mandarin, Russian, and English coexist alongside emerging dialects. The author's footnotes on language and culture enrich the setting, adding significant depth."

While she identifies as a historical fiction writer, her work often includes strong sci-fi elements, which shows how restrictive genres can be. This book is definitely sci-fi, and it also features romance, particularly swoony queer romance, which is a hallmark of her work.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The story is set in a dystopian future where Earth is in crisis—London is mostly underwater, the US is on fire, and there’s war between Russia and America. January, a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, is forced to flee after a severe flood and is offered a chance to escape to Mars. On Mars, tensions arise between Earth-born humans (Earthstrongers) and native Mars-born humans (Naturals), who are evolving to adapt to the planet’s conditions. The plot revolves around an upcoming election, with one side advocating for accepting refugees and the other pushing for Earthstrongers to undergo a life-limiting process called \"naturalisation.\" The story explores themes of responsibility, nationalism, and the personal versus the political.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding is wonderfully realized, with fascinating details like the mammoths and the linguistic evolution on Mars, where people speak Mandarin, Russian, and English, with developing dialects. Pulley’s footnotes about language and culture add depth to the setting.  \n\n- **Romance and Relationships:**  \n  The book features a Fake Relationship trope, which is quintessential romance fiction. The relationship between January and the senator is twisty, complex, and full of both physical and emotional risk.  \n\n- **Gender and Representation:**  \n  On Mars, it’s considered rude to gender people, and all Naturals are referred to as \"they.\" Their appearance is gender-neutral, and they’ve been genetically tweaked to avoid human sexual dimorphism. This leads to interesting reflections on how readers interpret characters based on their own socialization. While some reviews suggest Pulley avoids including women to sidestep accusations of misogyny, this isn’t entirely accurate, though the gender-neutral presentation does lean towards a default maleness.  \n\n- **Characterization and Personal Issues:**  \n  There’s a peculiar focus on weight in the book, but I believe this is more reflective of January’s character, given his background as a ballet dancer, rather than the author’s personal views. Ballet dancers often have unique and sometimes unhealthy attitudes toward their bodies and diets.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling blend of sci-fi, romance, and thought-provoking themes, set in a richly detailed world. Pulley’s writing continues to captivate, and the exploration of gender, identity, and societal tensions adds depth to the narrative. While there are some quirks in the portrayal of weight and gender, the story remains engaging and immersive.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story starts as a science fiction novel but effortlessly evolves into a political thriller, a whodunnit, and a romance. The protagonist, January, a former lead dancer at the London Royal Ballet, grapples with the physical challenges of Mars while being cynically exploited for optics in a political campaign. The central locked-room mystery further enhances the intrigue.",
            "The opening chapter skillfully establishes the setting and introduces January, whose background as a dancer complicates his adjustment to life on Mars. The book's immersive quality blurs the lines between genres, seamlessly balancing various narrative elements.",
            "Natasha Pulley, renowned for her historical fiction, seamlessly transitions into science fiction with this story. Her previous works have hinted at speculative elements, and here she skillfully weaves complex themes into a richly detailed world.",
            "This book delves deeply into the science of low gravity and its physiological effects on Mars. Earthlings must wear exoskeleton-like cages in public to manage their natural strength and speed, preventing them from overpowering the local Martians. The world-building is impressive, depicting a predominantly Chinese-speaking society on Mars that has evolved beyond traditional gender norms, rendering concepts like a male ballet principal outdated. Initially skeptical about the feasibility of Mars colonies, I found the setting captivating. Mars serves as a science fiction backdrop where selective hardships shape civilization, even if some elements are somewhat simplified. Set against the backdrop of Earth's ecological collapse, Mars offers free travel and lodging to refugees, provided they work off their debt. The low gravity has led to generations of smaller, weaker inhabitants with fragile bones, creating a striking contrast to the robust Earthlings.",
            "The immigration and refugee allegory is both clear and compelling. Assimilation on Mars necessitates surgery that physically weakens Earthlings, rendering their return to Earth impossible. The exploration of immigration politics is thorough, presenting a system that feels like a natural extension of oligarchies and authoritarianism reminiscent of China."

        "conclusion": "A City On Mars is an impressive and enjoyable book that combines science fiction, political intrigue, mystery, and romance. Its exploration of immigration, assimilation, and physical adaptation is thought-provoking, and the seamless genre shifts keep the narrative engaging. The world-building and character development are exceptional, making this a standout read.",

Mars offers a science fiction backdrop where selective hardships can be applied to civilization, with some aspects potentially handwaved. The story is set in a future where Earth faces ecological collapse, and Mars offers free travel and lodging to refugees and those in need, with the condition that they work off their debt. The low gravity of Mars results in generations of weaker, smaller inhabitants with fragile bones, creating a stark contrast to the robust Earthlings.  \n\n- **Science and World-Building:**  \n  The book engages deeply with science, particularly the physiological effects of low gravity on Mars. Earthlings must wear exoskeleton-style cages in public to counteract their natural strength and speed, ensuring they don’t overpower the locals. The world-building extends to Mars’s predominantly Chinese-speaking society, which has evolved beyond traditional gender norms, making concepts like a male ballet principal offensive.  \n\n- **Themes and Allegory:**  \n  The immigration/refugee allegory is clear and compelling. Assimilation on Mars requires surgery to physically weaken Earthlings, making it impossible for them to return to Earth. The politics of immigration are thoroughly explored, with a system that feels like a natural extension of oligarchies and Chinese authoritarianism.  \n\n- **Plot and Genre Shifts:**  \n  The story begins as a science fiction novel but seamlessly transitions into a political thriller, a whodunnit, and a romance. The protagonist, January, a former lead dancer at the London Royal Ballet, struggles with the physical challenges of Mars and becomes embroiled in a political campaign where he is cynically used for optics. The central locked-room mystery adds another layer of intrigue.  \n\n- **Character Development and Immersion:**  \n  The opening chapter effectively sets the scene and introduces January, whose background as a dancer makes his adjustment to Mars particularly challenging. The book’s immersive quality made me lose track of its genre shifts, as it successfully balances multiple narrative elements.  \n\n- **Author’s Style and Adaptation:**  \n  Natasha Pulley, known for historical fiction, adapts well to science fiction. Her previous works have hinted at scientific or speculative elements, and she handles this story with skill, embedding complex themes within a richly detailed world.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\"A City On Mars\" is an impressive and enjoyable book that combines science fiction, political intrigue, mystery, and romance. Its exploration of immigration, assimilation, and physical adaptation is thought-provoking, and the seamless genre shifts keep the narrative engaging.

I don’t think she has a strong enough grasp on the complexity of these issues, nor should she be the one exploring them as major themes. The treatment of these serious topics lacks the respect and depth they deserve, and they aren’t pulled together in a meaningful way.  \n\n- **Entertainment Value:**  \n  Despite its flaws, this was the most entertained I’ve been reading a book in a while.

            "*Mars House* centers on January, a former ballet dancer who relocates to a Martian colony to escape the climate crisis on Earth.

January enters a marriage of convenience with nationalist politician Aubrey Gale, only to uncover that Gale is not as straightforward as they initially seemed. Amidst this, the story unfolds with sabotage of Mars' infrastructure and the mystery of a missing person, adding layers of tension to January's journey.",

While I enjoy all her books, her last novel, *The Kingdoms*, left a bad taste in my mouth, and I was pretty sure she’d never recapture the magic of *Watchmaker*.  \n\n- **Plot and Premise:**  \n  *Mars House* follows January, a former ballet dancer who emigrates to a colony on Mars to escape climate disaster on Earth. On Mars, Earth immigrants face discrimination because, due to differences in gravity, they are many times stronger than “natural” Martian humans and can accidentally kill them. January ends up in a marriage of convenience with a nationalist politician named Aubrey Gale, but discovers Gale is not quite as they first appeared. Meanwhile, someone is sabotaging Mars infrastructure, and there’s a missing person looming over the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  Underneath the plot, the book explores themes of power—who has it, whether it can be used ethically, how it can be shared equitably, and the consequences of its misuse. The literal power crisis in the story serves as a thematic anchor.  \n\n- **Engagement and Immersion:**  \n  Despite the heavy themes, the book is far from dry.
