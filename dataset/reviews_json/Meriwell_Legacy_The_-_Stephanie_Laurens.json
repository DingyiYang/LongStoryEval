The plot keeps you guessing, especially as you try to figure out how and why the murderer committed the crime.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n  The ending includes a couple of convenient or \"pat\" moments, such as the lost son appearing just in time. While these moments felt a bit too neat, they didn’t detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  Penelope’s character is particularly engaging, and I loved watching her mind work through the problems and interactions with other characters. The progression of her life, including having her second child, adds depth and continuity to the series.  \n\n- **Series Continuity and Standalone Appeal:**  \n  While the book can be enjoyed as a standalone, reading the series in order enhances the experience, as it provides context for the characters’ development and the passage of time (over seven years since the first book).  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Escapism:**  \n  The novel is a very enjoyable read, offering a perfect escape into its world.
