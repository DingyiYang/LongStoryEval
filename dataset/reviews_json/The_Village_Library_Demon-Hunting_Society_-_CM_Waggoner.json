While I was initially drawn in by the premise, anticipating a dark thriller infused with suspense and satire, it ultimately unfolded as a cozy mystery with supernatural elements. The attempted blend of humor, suspense, and thrills fell flat, leaving the narrative feeling caught between genres without fully embracing either. As I continued reading, my interest dwindled. The story felt forgettable, reminiscent of other cozy mysteries like *How to Age Disgracefully* and *Queen of Poisons*, which did little to help it stand out. The lack of character depth and the genre confusion made it challenging to remain engaged.",
            "The librarian, as the main character, lacked sufficient backstory, which left me wanting more depth. The narrative would have benefited from exploring her early involvement in solving cases, the development of her romance, her friendship with the priest, and her awareness of the village's strange occurrences. Without this context, it was difficult to fully invest in her journey, her loss, and her battle against possession. While I appreciated the title, cover, and the concept's potential, I found myself wishing for a darker, more compelling take on the story. The book felt safe, likely aiming to appeal to a broader audience, but this approach didn't resonate with me."

However, the novel leaves some questions unanswered, such as the accountability of the murderers, which feels frustratingly vague.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book balances humor and absurdity, making it an enjoyable read. It’s particularly refreshing as it’s completely removed from reality, offering escapism. The inclusion of demon possession is handled with a light touch, described as \"just the right amount.\"  \n\n- **Miscellaneous Details:**  \n  The novel includes a fat marmalade cat named Lord Thomas Cromwell, who remains unharmed, adding a touch of charm to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for its clever subversion of the cozy murder mystery genre, its quirky protagonist, and its meta storytelling. While it leaves some thematic questions unresolved, it’s a delightful and escapist read, perfect for the current times.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It presents itself as a meta-text on the tropes and conventions of the cozy mystery genre, which I love as a concept.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite my appreciation for the concept, I didn’t enjoy the book much. However, I acknowledge that this is likely a personal preference rather than a flaw in the book itself.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  I found this book more successful in achieving its goals compared to its spiritual, sci-fi cousin, *The Midsolar Murders* series by Mur Lafferty.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  If you genuinely enjoy any of the subgenres mentioned—cozy mystery, cozy fantasy, or elderly characters solving crimes—I would recommend this book.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I appreciate the novel’s clever exploration of cozy mystery tropes and its unique blend of genres, it didn’t resonate with me personally.

While I don’t usually enjoy books about librarians, this one struck the right tone and reminded me of my wonderful colleagues and what makes librarians unique.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n  Thanks to NetGalley for providing the e-ARC.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the initial challenges with the shifting style, the book is an enjoyable, heartwarming read with charming characters and a delightful tone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It shifts from a lighthearted murder investigation to a more sinister narrative involving demons and a potential Hellmouth. A surprising plot twist reveals that the town of Winesap serves as a stage for murders orchestrated by a bored demon, adding depth and complexity to the story.",

Her grief over Alan's death compels her to confront her own self-deception and search for purpose. The demon's manipulation of the townspeople, along with Sherry's eventual acceptance of her role, enriches her character development. Additionally, Lord Thomas Cromwell, Sherry's cat, intriguingly embodies the spirit of the historical figure, adding another layer to the narrative.",

            "The pacing was reasonably good and kept my interest as Sherry followed up on clues and did research. The story took an unexpected turn when Sherry’s cat started talking to her, urging her to investigate. Things escalated when Sherry realized something more sinister, like demons, was at work. The demon interference parts felt a bit hokey, but the story wrapped up well, though the very last bits seemed unimportant unless there are more books planned. ",
            "I liked Sherry and her personal journey throughout the story. She enjoys solving mysteries and has had quite a run on solving town murders recently. Her sort of friend, Charlotte, asked her to investigate when her husband was killed, and Sherry successfully found the real culprit. Now, with her boyfriend murdered, she is unsure about investigating but feels compelled to protect herself and her friends. ",
            "The Village Library and Demon-Hunting Society wasn’t exactly what I expected. The library wasn’t very involved, except for Sherry working there and doing some research. There wasn’t much of a demon-hunting society either; mostly, it was Sherry with occasional help from her friends. "

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I liked Sherry and her personal journey throughout the story. She enjoys solving mysteries and has had quite a run on solving town murders recently. Her sort of friend, Charlotte, asked her to investigate when her husband was killed, and Sherry successfully found the real culprit. Now, with her boyfriend murdered, she is unsure about investigating but feels compelled to protect herself and her friends.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was reasonably good and kept my interest as Sherry followed up on clues and did research. The story took an unexpected turn when Sherry’s cat started talking to her, urging her to investigate. Things escalated when Sherry realized something more sinister, like demons, was at work. The demon interference parts felt a bit hokey, but the story wrapped up well, though the very last bits seemed unimportant unless there are more books planned.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building:**  \n  The Village Library and Demon-Hunting Society wasn’t exactly what I expected. The library wasn’t very involved, except for Sherry working there and doing some research. There wasn’t much of a demon-hunting society either; mostly, it was Sherry with occasional help from her friends.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator was new to me, but I was very comfortable with her performance. She was fantastic and suited to the main character, Sherry. Her voice sounded a bit older, but she handled other characters’ voices well, making them age-appropriate. I listened at my usual 1.5x speed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed Sherry’s character and her journey through the story. The pacing kept me engaged, though the demon elements felt a bit out of place. The narration was excellent and added to the experience. While the library and demon-hunting society weren’t as prominent as I expected, the story had a satisfying conclusion, leaving room for potential sequels.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story provided a satisfying resolution to the main mystery, with Sherry uncovering the truth behind the murders and the demonic activity. However, the very last bits of the ending felt unimportant unless there are plans for future books involving Sherry and more demon-hunting adventures. The story begins with Sherry investigating the murder of Charlotte’s husband, which she solves successfully. However, the plot thickens when her boyfriend is murdered, and she becomes a potential suspect.

            "The novel ends on a poignant note, with the town freed from the demon’s influence. However, the mention of vampires in another town hints at a potential continuation of the story, with Sherry’s friend setting off to confront this new threat, likely orchestrated by the same demon. The novel is an inventive and engaging read, perfect for autumn vibes. It revolves around Sherry, a librarian who assists the town detective in solving murders. The story takes a dark twist when Sherry’s boyfriend, Alan, is murdered, and she is compelled to uncover the truth. The plot reveals a demon orchestrating the murders as part of a twisted game, with the entire town seemingly hypnotized and isolated from the outside world. The concept is reminiscent of “The Truman Show,” with a supernatural twist. The murders are intricately woven into the plot, with each case revealing unexpected motives and connections. Sherry’s investigation uncovers Alan’s involvement in his son’s drug business and Alice’s theft, leading to her act of murder. The demon’s manipulation of the town and its inhabitants adds a layer of complexity to the mystery. The resolution is both shocking and satisfying, with Sherry sacrificing herself to rid the town of the demon. The detective’s cover-up, attributing the events to contaminated flour and a bus crash, provides a clever conclusion. ",

            "The story is set in Winesap, a small town in New York that inexplicably seems stuck in the 1980s, despite being a present-day setting. The high number of murders in such a small town is unusual, and Sherry, the protagonist, finds herself solving each one. As she becomes aware of the town's strangeness, including the sheriff's acceptance of her involvement, the murders strike closer to home, and the situation escalates. The plot takes a supernatural turn when her cat starts talking to her, though the cat plays a relatively small role in the story. The book starts off slow and is somewhat hard to get into, but it gradually becomes more engaging as the mystery deepens. The supernatural elements, such as the talking cat and the demon controlling the town, add intrigue, though some aspects, like Sherry’s delayed realization of the town’s 1980s lifestyle, feel underdeveloped. The conclusion is satisfying and ties the story together well. Despite some lingering questions, such as why Sherry didn’t notice the town’s outdated lifestyle sooner, the overall resolution makes for an enjoyable read. ",

The sheriff’s behavior, from demanding her help to arresting her, adds to the tension and mystery surrounding the characters. "

There were long stretches of investigation without overtly supernatural events, and I wanted a stronger, more threatening presence from the demon to raise the stakes.  \n- **Sequel Potential:**  \n  The setup for a sequel at the end was intriguing, and I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise that kept me engaged from start to finish.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Target Audience:**  \n  The book is described as a \"Chased occult cozy murder mystery for the middle school set, but aimed at adults.\" While the concept is intriguing, it doesn’t fully deliver on its promise. The attempt to blend adult content with a middle-grade style falls short of the quality expected in either category.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Depth:**  \n  The writing often feels superficial, with a restrained and meandering flow from paragraph to paragraph. The narrative hesitates to take risks, opting instead for a \"soft roundabout return to basic beige.\" This lack of boldness undermines the potential of the story.  \n\n- **Tone and Approach:**  \n  The book tries too hard to be inoffensive, which ironically becomes offensive by failing to fulfill its promise. Cozy genres like horror, mystery, or fantasy don’t need to be bland; they can challenge readers or embrace uniqueness without apologizing for it. The excessive focus on \"comfort\" misses the mark, as it avoids surprising or engaging turns, leaving the story feeling empty and middle-of-the-road.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  The comparison to Miss Marple highlights a key issue: while she might have worn \"basic beige,\" her personality was anything but. In contrast, this book’s characters and tone lack depth and distinctiveness, contributing to the overall sense of mediocrity.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has an interesting premise but fails to execute it effectively. Its overly cautious approach, superficial writing, and lack of bold choices result in a story that feels bland and unfulfilling. While it attempts to blend adult themes with a middle-grade style, it doesn’t meet the standards of quality for either audience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Genre Appeal:**  \n  The premise of the book struck me as a fun and spooky/paranormal mystery, which felt fitting for the season. To a certain extent, it delivered on this expectation.  \n\n- **Characterization:**  \n  I very much enjoyed the snark and sarcasm of Sherry, the protagonist. However, the other characters felt under-developed, and their relationships seemed random. I even had to check if I was reading the second book in a series because it felt like I was supposed to know more about these people and their small town.  \n\n- **Humor and Writing Style:**  \n  The Catholic humor was quite witty, and several lines made me audibly laugh. This was a highlight of the book for me.  \n\n- **Plot Structure and Pacing:**  \n  The plot felt untethered and scattered. There was too much happening—the demon, the murders, the possessed cat, and too many possible suspects—and some pieces felt disjointed. The solution to the murder was anticlimactic and unsurprising, which I found disappointing.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  The ending sets up very nicely for the next installment in the series, which honestly sounds much more intriguing than this one.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the protagonist’s humor and the witty writing, the under-developed characters, scattered plot, and anticlimactic resolution left me feeling disappointed. Despite not loving this book, I might give the second one a chance due to the promising setup for the next installment.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I absolutely adore Sherry. She embodies the kind of librarian I imagined I’d be. She describes others in terms of her favorite book characters, plants fairy gardens, and uses her knowledge of books to solve crimes. Her musings, like wondering if someone sees her as a fat old badger in a bonnet, are endearing and relatable, especially as a fellow librarian. Her quirky habits, such as turning to Tolstoy to cure insomnia, made me giggle and added depth to her character. ",
            "The call-backs to various stories, characters, and authors are delightful and enrich the narrative. The way Sherry’s world is intertwined with literature creates a charming and immersive experience. The line, I wanted a librarian. I had to look a long time to find you. A librarian who knows about the stories, perfectly captures the essence of her character and the story’s literary heart. ",
            "I’d describe this as a cozy mystery, reminiscent of my favorite series like the Atherton books and the Aunt Dimity stories. It also evokes the spirit of Christie’s adventures, though with a unique twist—like the demon element, which adds an unexpected layer of intrigue. The tone is warm, engaging, and filled with a love for storytelling. "

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Subplots:**  \n  - The mystery aspect of the novel was engaging, particularly the \"who killed ___?\" storyline involving two murders.  \n  - The \"demon problems\" subplot felt unnecessary and poorly integrated. The demon's motivations were unclear, and its actions seemed disconnected from the main mystery, making this subplot feel extraneous.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - Shelly, the protagonist, was well-developed. She started as a traditionally retiring and somewhat fluffy librarian but grew into a strong lead.  \n  - Her supporting group, referred to as her \"Scooby crew,\" also showed nice development throughout the story.  \n  - Shelly's gradual realization that Winesap is a town plagued by murder was a relatable and well-executed character arc.  \n\n- **World-Building and Continuity:**  \n  - The novel effectively conveyed a sense of history, suggesting that Shelly had solved previous mysteries, which added depth to the story.  \n  - The book also hinted at a future, creating a feeling of continuity and potential for further installments.  \n\n- **Tone and References:**  \n  - The book avoided overused tropes, such as directly referencing Jessica Fletcher from *Murder, She Wrote*, which was a refreshing choice.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel had strong elements, particularly in its mystery plot, character development, and world-building. However, the inclusion of the demon subplot detracted from the story's cohesion and lowered its overall impact. Without this subplot, the book could have been a much stronger read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars, rounded up."

Other memorable characters include a goofy priest who feels out of his depth, a \"grieving\" widow, and a semi-evil demon that decides to assist by possessing the main heroine’s house cat.  \n\n- **Series Potential:**  \n  I’ve heard there are going to be more books in this series, and I’m genuinely excited about that prospect.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a delightful modern twist on classic mystery storytelling, with a charming cast of characters and an engaging narrative style. It’s a perfect blend of humor, mystery, and the paranormal, making it a highly enjoyable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The author clearly understands that librarians work with people and don’t just shush others or read books all day.  \n- **Tone and Style:**  \n  The book had a cozy mystery vibe, reminiscent of *Murder She Wrote* or Granny from *The Looney Tunes*, which evoked a nostalgic feeling from my childhood.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this urban fantasy novel, particularly its engaging murder mystery, accurate portrayal of a librarian, and cozy, nostalgic tone. It was a refreshing read compared to another librarian-themed book I read recently.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There was barely any demon research or action, and it leaned more into the cozy mystery genre.  \n\n- **Genre Experience:**  \n  As someone new to the cozy mystery subgenre, I found it to be a quick and easy read, though it may not become my favorite genre.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  I appreciated the author’s writing style, which made the book enjoyable despite the genre mismatch.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was a fun and easy read, it didn’t meet my expectations of a demon-hunting story. The cozy mystery angle was unexpected, and though I enjoyed the writing style, the genre itself may not be my preference.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5"

Despite my usual commitment to giving a book 50 pages, I couldn’t get past page 13 because of how monotonous and uninteresting it was.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned, but the tone suggests a very low rating, likely 1/5 or 2/5."

The story felt more like a traditional cozy mystery rather than a fantasy-infused one.  \n\n- **Plot and Tone:**  \n  The plot was average and leaned heavily into the cozy mystery genre, which made it feel somewhat conventional and lacking in the unique twist I was hoping for.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the title hinted at a blend of fantasy and mystery, the novel fell short of delivering on that promise. It remained a standard cozy mystery without the intriguing paranormal or fantasy elements I anticipated.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nN/A (No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
