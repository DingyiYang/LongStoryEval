This location is linked to a paranormal event from 20 years ago, during which Talitha's family may still be trapped. The novel delves into themes of unreliable narration, with Talitha portrayed as a haunted and enigmatic figure, creating a compelling contrast between truth and perception. The author skillfully keeps readers on the edge of their seats, building suspense and intrigue throughout. The pacing ensures that readers remain engaged and guessing until the very end.",

Her former lover, Brett, is an intriguing character who breathes new life into derelict buildings but is understandably hesitant to return to the area. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Enid deepens the narrative, contributing to its Gothic and unsettling atmosphere.",

Her skill in delving into the not-so-distant past and the everyday horrors is both unnerving and reminiscent of Bentley Little. The novel carries a Shirley Jackson-esque quality, especially in the enigmatic character of Enid, which evokes the haunting atmosphere of “We Have Always Lived in the Castle.”",

It explores themes of reclaiming power, confronting past demons, and the unsettling horrors of everyday life, resulting in a gripping and suspenseful narrative."

Fans of *Archive 81* and Shirley Jackson’s works will particularly enjoy this story. Highly recommended.",

With its unreliable narrator, themes of reclaiming power, and a suspenseful plot, the novel keeps readers captivated from start to finish. Fans of *Archive 81* and Shirley Jackson’s works will particularly enjoy this story. Highly recommended.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This concept immediately caught my attention and felt like it could have been a great Twilight Zone episode.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Tone:**  \n  The book oozes atmosphere, creating an eerie and ghostly feel that kept me engaged. I often wondered how the outside world perceived the disappearance of the street, which added to the mystery and tension.  \n\n- **Themes and Elements:**  \n  The story incorporates a mix of mystery, horror (more psychological and eerie than gory), friendship, longing, a love story, family dynamics, and the feeling of being trapped. It also explores deeper issues such as trauma, guilt, and the effects of abuse/sexual abuse, which added emotional depth.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  Tabitha Velkwood is a compelling protagonist, haunted by her past, a promise she made, her feelings, and the street itself. I found her character fascinating and relatable. However, I wished there was more development for the character of Enid, who I found intriguing but underutilized.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The book evoked a range of emotions, from curiosity and fascination to unease and empathy. The exploration of trauma and guilt added a layer of emotional resonance that made the story more impactful.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and chilling read, blending mystery, horror, and emotional depth in a unique and atmospheric way. While I wished for more development of certain characters like Enid, the story’s eerie tone, intriguing premise, and exploration of complex themes made it a memorable and thought-provoking experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The plot is rich in symbolism and complexity, exploring abstract themes tied to a neighborhood haunting. While some symbols are impactful, others lack clarity. This narrative messiness reflects the challenge of processing memories and emotions, such as guilt, but can also render the story disjointed and difficult to follow.",

It examines the psychic residue left by sites of conflict and its impact on self-perception and worldview. The haunting serves as a metaphor for deeper human issues, particularly past traumas and social stigmas that entrap individuals in cycles of inadequacy, shame, and oppression.

The reasons behind the characters' departure from the neighborhood and the final revelations were both gripping and satisfying. However, the first 25-30% of the book felt slow and less engaging, making it somewhat of a slog.

In contrast, Grace feels underdeveloped; her adult fixation on the past and her quiet, boyfriend-focused teenage self are noted, but her backstory and motivations lack clarity, rendering her more of a secondary character. While Talitha's toxic family dynamic is hinted at, it is not explored as thoroughly as Brett's, leaving some gaps in fully understanding her character.",

The title hinted at a haunting, but I wasn’t sure if Velkwood referred to a city, a house, or a person. It turned out to be all three, which was intriguing.  \n\n- **Character Development (Talitha Velkwood):**  \n   - Talitha is a 40-year-old protagonist who feels stuck in life and haunted by her past. The book gradually reveals her backstory, leaving readers to wonder whether she did something wrong or if something was done to her. She’s a compelling character, down on her luck and undervaluing her life, which makes her decision to participate in Jack’s experiment believable.  \n\n- **Setting and World-Building (Velkwood Vicinity):**  \n   - The story is set in a small, mysterious housing complex named after Talitha’s family. The complex became a ghost town overnight when Talitha was a college freshman, with everyone presumed dead or missing. The street is now sealed behind a forcefield, accessible only to Talitha and her childhood friends, Brett and Grace. This eerie setting, known as the Velkwood Vicinity, is central to the story’s mystery.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters (Jack, Brett, Grace, and Enid):**  \n   - Jack and his team are intriguing but disturbing in how they insert themselves into Talitha’s life. Brett is a deeply traumatized character, and her fractured relationship with Talitha is both compelling and bleak. Grace, however, remains underdeveloped, and I didn’t form a strong opinion about her. Enid, though a minor character, stood out to me. She deserved more attention, and I wished the book explored her backstory further.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**  \n   - The writing is simple and easy to follow, with swift pacing that keeps the story flowing seamlessly from one scene to the next. It’s a cozy horror read with a paranormal lean, making it both engaging and accessible.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The book explores themes of trauma, mystery, and the weight of the past.

            "While the story had potential, I found the characters to be a significant letdown. I wished for a longer narrative to fully explore Talitha and Brett's dynamics and emotions. Much of their depth remained unexpressed for too long, leaving me wanting to delve deeper into Talitha's thoughts before the story wrapped up.",

The eerie atmosphere, particularly during the characters' visit to Velkwood, instills a persistent sense of unease.

The eerie and haunting atmosphere, especially once the characters visited Velkwood, created a constant feeling of something being slightly wrong. The gothic tone and societal horrors became more impactful as the history of the town was revealed. The creepy atmosphere never stopped overtaking me, making the story unique despite its familiar premise of a girl returning to her hometown to solve a mystery.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The mystery of how the events happened, how they would end, how the three friends escaped, and what caused the deterioration of their relationship was compelling. Each reveal tied the themes together more and more, adding depth to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I didn’t absolutely love the characters, which was the big let-down of the book for me. I wish it was longer so we could have explored more of Talitha and Brett’s characters. There was so much potential in their dynamics and emotions, but much of it remained unsaid for too long. I wanted to dive deeper into those feelings, especially in Talitha’s mind, before the story concluded.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the character-related shortcomings, I was very happily surprised by this book. The themes, atmosphere, and mystery made it a memorable and unsettling read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was both inspiring and horrifying, with a haunting atmosphere and well-woven themes that kept me engaged. While the characters could have been more developed, the eerie tone and societal horrors made the story stand out.

It felt reminiscent of *Twin Peaks* or *The Haunting of Hill House* but still managed to be wholly original.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  My only real gripe is that the main characters didn’t feel fully fleshed out. It was hard for me to buy into their chemistry, as they seemed more like sketches of themselves rather than fully realized individuals. This made it challenging to connect with them on a deeper level.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found the novel’s premise and atmosphere to be incredibly engaging and original, evoking a sense of eerie familiarity while standing out on its own. However, the lack of depth in the main characters and their relationships slightly hindered my ability to fully immerse myself in the story.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The way Velkwood pulls the characters—and the reader—into its world is masterfully done.\n   - The book’s length is perfect for the story, and the writing style is accessible even for readers new to the horror genre.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**\n   - The story is both creepy and emotionally resonant. I felt a sense of hopelessness and despair alongside the characters, particularly Talitha, as she navigated the haunting memories of Velkwood.\n   - The emotional depth of the characters and their struggles made the story more engaging and relatable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*The Haunting of Velkwood* is a captivating and eerie novel that blends horror, mystery, and emotional depth. Gwendolyn Kiste’s storytelling is immersive, and the well-developed characters and chilling setting make for a compelling read. Even as someone who doesn’t typically read horror, I found this book to be a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking experience. I would recommend it to all readers, especially those looking for a perfect introduction to the genre.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The story spends excessive time on Sophie, whose role feels tangential, detracting from the opportunity to develop Enid’s backstory or explore the pivotal incident that altered everything. While the emotional weight of the ghost story rests with Brett, the narrative disproportionately focuses on Talitha, who seems less integral to the core conflict. The plot centers on Talitha Velkwood, who is drawn back into her enigmatic past when she needs money. She is enlisted to assist a researcher in uncovering the secrets of the Velkwood Vicinity, a neighborhood accessible only to Talitha, her estranged best friend Brett, and Grace, who has briefly crossed its perimeter. The novel delves into themes of guilt, the haunting nature of the past, and the lengths people will go for love. With an intriguing premise that weaves together friendship, unresolved romantic tension, sibling bonds, and supernatural elements, the story holds promise but could benefit from a more focused narrative.",
            "In the beginning, Talitha reminded me of Camille from *Sharp Objects*, but that impression faded as the story unfolded. Brett, however, struck me as a blend of Stockard Channing and Haley Lu Richardson, emerging as the most vivid and memorable character. Talitha’s motivation to save her sister Sophie feels inconsistent; it takes her 20 years and a ghostly photo to take action, which undermines her sense of urgency. Sophie’s role seems unnecessary, primarily serving as a plot device to propel Talitha’s actions. Enid, a character with significant potential, is underdeveloped; while Talitha acknowledges her importance to the Velkwood Vicinity, her backstory remains largely unexplored. Similarly, Grace feels underutilized and like an afterthought, despite her role in the story’s resolution. In contrast, Brett emerges as the emotional core of the narrative. Her suffering and glimpses into her past reveal the true heart of the ghost story, making her feel like the rightful protagonist rather than Talitha.",
            "The novel masterfully contrasts the past and present, vividly depicting the Velkwood neighborhood with a nostalgic 90s aesthetic, while the present feels bleak and sterile, intensified by the presence of researchers. This palpable sense of longing throughout the story makes me root for a happy ending for Talitha and Brett."

        "conclusion": "*The Haunting of Velkwood* is a haunting and atmospheric novel with a strong premise and emotional core, particularly in Brett’s story. However, it suffers from underdeveloped characters, inconsistent motivations, and a narrative focus that doesn’t fully align with its most compelling elements. While the story is engaging, it leaves me wishing for more depth and exploration of its secondary characters and pivotal events.",

She is pulled back into the mystery when researcher Jack offers her compensation to return and uncover the truth. The discovery of a photograph that seemingly features her sister Sophie compels Talitha to seek closure.",

Her relationship with Brett is compelling; they are opposites yet share a profound connection. The bond between Talitha and Sophie is particularly poignant, driving much of the narrative. Initially, Jack, the lead researcher, appears suspicious but ultimately reveals himself to be genuine and empathetic toward Talitha’s struggles. In contrast, the faceless, horde-like researchers embody soulless bureaucracy and corporate greed, making them detestable.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n  The premise of the story is intriguing, focusing on a unique paranormal phenomenon called The Velkwood Haunting, where an entire street becomes a ghost town. The idea of houses shimmering with an otherworldly quality and the mystery of nothing coming in or out is compelling.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Talitha is a deeply endearing character, shaped by grief, longing, and guilt over the past twenty years. Her emotional struggle, particularly her inability to move on from the loss of her sister, is well-portrayed. She is a character with a heart full of love, but her fixation on the past has caused her to forget how to live.  \n\n- **Themes:**  \n  The novel is a study in grief, longing, and guilt, exploring how these emotions shape Talitha's life and relationships. The emotional depth of the story is a strong point, though it sometimes overshadows other elements.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The story is relatively short, which prevents it from becoming overly bogged down. However, the pacing is slow, with more emphasis on Talitha's internal thoughts and relationships than on action or plot progression.  \n\n- **Horror and Atmosphere:**  \n  For a horror novel, the book lacks a strong sense of fear or atmospheric tension. The haunting itself takes a backseat to the emotional and relational aspects of the story, which is disappointing for readers expecting a more traditional horror experience.  \n\n- **Enjoyment and Overall Impression:**  \n  Despite its shortcomings in the horror genre, the book is still an enjoyable read, particularly for those who appreciate character-driven stories. It’s a slow but engaging exploration of grief and guilt, though it may not satisfy readers looking for a truly scary experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel offers a unique premise and a deeply emotional exploration of grief, longing, and guilt through the lens of Talitha's character. While it falls short as a horror story due to its lack of scares and atmospheric tension, it remains an enjoyable read for those who appreciate introspective and character-focused narratives.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The impenetrable fog barrier adds a layer of mystery and intrigue, making the town a hotspot for various groups like occultists, scientists, and conspiracy theorists.\n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The story focuses on three women—Talitha, Grace, and Brett—who are drawn back to Velkwood Street, the place they once called home. Talitha, in particular, is a compelling protagonist. Down on her luck and with no clear future, she accepts an offer to return to Velkwood and report on its condition in exchange for money. The dynamics between the characters and their shared history add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Tone and Emotional Impact:**  \n  While the book has a haunting premise, it leans more toward emotional depth than outright horror. The ghosts in the story are not terrifying but rather sad reflections of regret and unfulfilled lives. This emotional core made the story more poignant than scary, and I found it deeply moving.\n\n- **Originality and Themes:**  \n  The novel explores themes of regret, unresolved pasts, and the haunting nature of memories. It stands out for its unique blend of supernatural elements and emotional storytelling, offering a fresh take on the haunted house trope.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Haunting of Velkwood* is a captivating and emotionally resonant novel that blends supernatural intrigue with heartfelt storytelling. While it may not be a traditional horror story, its exploration of regret and the ghosts of the past left a lasting impression on me. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and immersive experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The issues I noticed were incredibly minor—so minor that they don’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. I don’t even have specific examples to point to; they were that insignificant.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite the minor nitpicks, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The narrative was engaging and compelling, and the small imperfections didn’t detract from my overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I noticed a few tiny flaws in the editing and language, they were so minor that they didn’t impact my enjoyment of the novel.

Despite the underdeveloped scientific angle, the story’s human elements and emotional depth make it a memorable read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Premise and Concept:**  \n   - The novel revolves around Talithia Velkwood, who carries her fear and childhood trauma with her, influencing her personal and professional decisions.  \n   - The story is set in Velkwood Vicinity, a ghost town named after her family, which disappeared along with its people.  \n   - The premise is intriguing: a ghost town filled with ghosts that only allows Talithia, Brett, and Grace to enter. The longer they stay, the more they feel compelled to remain, as the ghosts seem to need them as much as they might need the ghosts.  \n\n- **Themes and Symbolism:**  \n   - The story explores themes of confronting the past, making amends, and the possibility of moving on.  \n   - The author, Gwendolyne Kiste, draws clear parallels between the women and the neighborhood, both of which are stuck and unable to move forward.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Talithia is portrayed as a deeply flawed and traumatized individual with no close friends, having left behind Brett and Grace, who share similar experiences.  \n   - The dynamics between Talithia, Brett, and Grace are central to the story, as they collectively face the ghosts of their past.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Execution:**  \n   - The author’s reiteration of the parallels between the women and the neighborhood felt tedious at times.  \n   - Despite this, the book is well-written and concise, making it a good, short read.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Resolution:**  \n   - The story raises questions about whether confronting the past will be freeing or if it will trap the characters in a cycle of reliving the same day forever.  \n   - The emotional weight of the narrative is palpable, as the characters grapple with their shared trauma and the pull of the ghost town.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a compelling story about confronting the ghosts of the past, both literal and metaphorical. While the reiteration of certain themes felt repetitive, the novel’s intriguing premise, strong character dynamics, and emotional depth make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

Despite its potential, the story didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐⭐.5 stars  \nWould I recommend it? 🚫 No."

            "The novel presents a captivating premise centered on time loops, ghosts, and a haunted neighborhood accessible only to the main characters.

Additionally, the absence of explanation regarding the origins of the haunting detracted from my overall experience.",

While the novel addresses themes of grief and trauma, it often lacks the depth and emotional resonance I hoped for. Certain plot elements, such as the time loop in Velkwood, show promise but are not fully explored or utilized.",

Her feelings for Brett are intertwined with shame and unresolved issues, resulting in a portrayal that feels stale and incomplete. The lack of meaningful communication between Talitha and Brett, despite their long history, undermines the potential for a deeper exploration of their relationship. \n\nAs the narrator, Talitha comes across as stagnant and underdeveloped; her life over the past 20 years is barely explored, leaving her character feeling flat. Her emotional numbness and lack of reaction to significant events—such as encountering ghosts or reuniting with her sister—make it difficult to connect with her or the story. In contrast, Brett is more fleshed out, while Talitha’s narration lacks depth and fails to effectively convey the passage of time.\n\nAdditionally, Jack, a key character introduced early on, is abruptly removed from the story, which feels jarring and unsatisfying. Grace, the third friend, serves little purpose and is underutilized, while Enid, a magical and intriguing character, is not given enough significance in the plot, despite her potential to add depth and complexity."

While some readers might appreciate this predictability, it was too straightforward for my taste.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel presents an interesting and unique concept with its haunting premise, but the predictability of the plot lessened its impact for me. It may appeal to readers who enjoy knowing how a story will unfold, but it fell short of my expectations for a more surprising and engaging narrative.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The metaphor of emotional ghosts and shadows was overused, diminishing the impact of the ending, which could have been more powerful with better development. While the idea of a neighborhood detached from time and space was intriguing, the execution did not live up to its potential. The supernatural elements, including Enid’s unexplained powers and the bugs, were captivating but underdeveloped. Ultimately, the story's promise was overshadowed by its focus on less compelling characters and relationships.",

Brett, her love interest, comes across as unrealistically patient, while Grace lacks clear motivation and depth. Enid, the most intriguing character, is underdeveloped, representing a missed opportunity for a stronger protagonist. The supporting characters, especially Enid, have more compelling arcs that remain unexplored. Additionally, the subplot involving Grace’s brothers and the witchy resurrection of Enid feels rushed and insufficiently explained.",

However, my high expectations led to greater disappointment when the story didn’t resonate with me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Narrative Voice**  \n   - The author's prose didn’t vibe with me, and the YA-ish first-person narrative of the protagonist, Talitha, made it hard to connect with her. The writing style felt mismatched with the story’s tone and themes.  \n\n- **Character Development and Empathy**  \n   - Talitha, the protagonist, was difficult to empathize with. She felt like a passive character who was dragged along by the plot rather than driving it. Brett, her love interest, was overly patient to the point of being unrealistic, and Grace’s character lacked clear motivation or depth. Enid, the most intriguing character, was underdeveloped and felt like a missed opportunity for a stronger protagonist.  \n\n- **Setting and Time Period**  \n   - The story felt misplaced in time. Despite being set in the '90s, the characters' struggles and societal dynamics seemed more fitting for the '50s, which created a disconnect.  \n\n- **Themes and Execution**  \n   - The themes of childhood trauma and its persistence into adulthood were neither subtle nor well-executed. The resolution relied on a predictable \"power of friendship\" trope that felt unearned. The portrayal of trauma and societal indifference lacked depth and nuance.  \n\n- **Plot and World-Building**  \n   - The concept of a neighborhood detaching from time and space was fascinating, but the execution fell flat. The supernatural elements, such as Enid’s unexplained powers and the bugs, were intriguing but underdeveloped. The story’s potential was overshadowed by its focus on less compelling characters and relationships.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Subplots**  \n   - The supporting characters, particularly Enid, had more interesting arcs that were never fully explored. The subplot involving Grace’s brothers and the witchy resurrection of Enid felt rushed and unexplained.  \n\n- **Pacing and Resolution**  \n   - The pacing was uneven, and the resolution felt unsatisfying.

            "The story effectively explores the theme of confronting past trauma, but the explanation for the supernatural events feels forced and unsatisfying. The revelation that Enid used her powers to create the ghostly street to conceal the murder of Brett's abusive stepfather complicates the narrative unnecessarily. The story would have been stronger if the supernatural elements remained unexplained, with the street's issues arising spontaneously from the characters' complicity, intolerance, and unresolved trauma. Additionally, the ending—particularly Talitha's acceptance of Enid's role in Sophie's death—feels unrealistic. Given that Enid was directly responsible for Sophie's death, it strains credulity to believe Talitha could accept it so easily. A more spontaneous manifestation of the supernatural events, akin to a natural disaster, would have made Talitha's acceptance more believable.",

While their love story is central to the narrative, I found it difficult to connect deeply with the characters or their romance.",

It is very different from many in the genre, where you jump into the speculative elements right away.  \n   - The author did an excellent job creating a creepy, unsettling atmosphere, which I enjoyed.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Although the main characters have fully-fledged backstories, they still felt hollow and, ironically, like ghosts.  \n   - We don’t get to know enough about them in the present, which made it hard for me to connect to the story.  \n\n- **Romantic Subplot:**  \n   - I never understood or liked how the protagonist talks about the male researcher (whose name I’ve already forgotten) and whether she wants to or should sleep with him.  \n   - This thought occurs immediately upon meeting him and several times throughout the book, but nothing ever happens, making it feel like unnecessary filler.  \n   - The jealousy from Brett later in the story also felt unimportant and baffling. I never understood why Talitha doesn’t just clarify that nothing happened.  \n\n- **Themes and Narrative Focus:**  \n   - It’s clear that the author set out to write a literary novel about homophobia, abuse, small-town bigotry, and growing up \"haunted,\" using the haunted town premise as a metaphor rather than the main focus.  \n   - The speculative elements, such as the hows and whys of the haunting, are flimsily explained and inconsistent.  \n   - I question many of the characters' choices and wonder if they were odd or bad, or if I just don’t relate due to not experiencing that kind of bigotry growing up.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Impact:**  \n   - I think this book may be very impactful for some people, particularly those in the LGBTQIA+ community, and I hope it finds its audience.  \n   - I would love to see more reviews and opinions from the LGBTQIA+ community to better understand their perspectives.  \n\n- **Personal Preference:**  \n   - Personally, I wanted the haunted story to be the focus rather than a plot device or metaphor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book left me conflicted.

            "The story primarily revolves around contempt—both for the homophobic and abusive individuals and their disdain for the main characters. This dynamic feels unbalanced. While there is a change of heart at the end, it lacks credibility due to insufficient character development leading up to that point. The characters suddenly express concern for abuse they had previously ignored, which comes across as forced.",

It didn’t make sense how they were still hung up on each other after 20 years of minimal contact.  \n   - One character is determined to move on with her life, yet she’s the one clinging to the MC, which felt inconsistent and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Writing and Themes:**  \n   - There are some well-written moments and powerful statements about abuse, homophobia, and the impact of neglectful or harmful parents.  \n   - However, the book didn’t deliver the emotional punch it should have, given its heavy themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel touches on important and poignant themes like abuse and homophobia, it falls short in execution. The lack of emotional connection, underdeveloped characters, messy plot, and unconvincing romance made it difficult to fully engage with the story. Despite some well-written moments, the book didn’t deliver the impact it promised.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I was invested in seeing their issues resolved, which ultimately happened. However, as the story progressed, Talitha, the first-person narrator, became less engaging.

However, Talitha, the first-person narrator, felt boring over time.

I was more drawn to the ancillary characters like Grace, Brett, and Enid, and wished they had been the focus of the story.  \n\n- **Plot Pacing and Tension:**  \n  The plot started strong, especially after Talitha’s first visit to Velkwood, which was extremely tense.

            "Talitha's self-sacrificing nature was off-putting; I would have preferred her primary motivation for staying to be her sister. Her desire to save everyone else felt illogical, especially considering how poorly they treated Brett and her insistence that she was the only one who cared. While Talitha's life was undeniably sad, it seemed she made little effort to improve her situation. Even when she did try, her goal was merely to be \"normal\" rather than embracing her true self and finding happiness. I felt for Brett, who appeared to be waiting for Talitha while reliving her own trauma due to Talitha's need for money and desire to return home—Brett deserved better. Grace was unlikable in both the past and present, likely due to her limited presence and portrayal through Talitha’s perspective. Enid, too, was treated unfairly; not only did she die, but she was also burdened with responsibilities that weren't hers. None of the girls, including Talitha, were truly her friends, and in the end, she was left to care for her little sister instead of living her own life."

The story follows the female main character as she seeks answers about her neighborhood and the fate of her mother and younger sister from 20 years ago.

The author presents intriguing ideas but struggles with execution, particularly in crafting a satisfying climax.",

While her journey was compelling, it was also difficult to witness, given my own experiences.  \n\n- **World-Building and Logic:**  \n  - The portrayal of scientists, researchers, and the surrounding zone felt underdeveloped and somewhat silly. The lack of scientific rigor, containment protocols, or involvement of agencies like the military, DHS, or NSA made the setting feel amateurish and unconvincing.  \n\n- **Originality and Uniqueness:**  \n  - Despite its flaws, the book stands out as a unique take on a ghost story. I haven’t encountered anything quite like it, and it offered an interesting and fresh perspective on the genre.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book has its strengths, particularly in its exploration of queer longing and its unique approach to a ghost story, certain elements—such as the lack of explanation in the magical realism and the underdeveloped scientific aspects—detracted from my overall enjoyment. The emotional weight of the story, while impactful, was also personally challenging to navigate.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- 3 stars (with the potential for 4 stars for readers who enjoy unexplained magical realism)."

Despite its brevity, it offers many messages and themes to unpack, making it a great choice for a literature class.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excels in its writing style and thematic depth, the repetitive plot and lack of stronger horror elements detract from the overall experience. It’s a thought-provoking read with a surprising twist, but it doesn’t fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 stars"

It was engaging and held my interest for the majority of the story.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending was disappointing to me. It was the type of conclusion I just don’t like, and it left me unsatisfied.  \n\n- **Themes and Depth:**  \n  I wish the novel had explored certain themes more deeply, such as isolation, coping with trauma, and complex relationships. These elements felt underdeveloped and could have added more richness to the story.  \n\n- **Comparison to Similar Works:**  \n  While I disliked the writing style of *The September House* by Carissa Orlando, I feel that it handled the themes of isolation and trauma more effectively than this novel did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed most of the novel, but the ending and the lack of depth in exploring key themes left me wanting more. While it had potential, it fell short in comparison to similar works.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It also shares thematic similarities with *Model Home* by Rivers Solomon, though my initial excitement for it didn’t fully hold up.\n- **Personal Connection:** The book served as the soundtrack to the first spread of my own writing project, which made it a meaningful companion during that creative process.\n- **Overall Enjoyment:** While I initially had high expectations, my enthusiasm for the novel waned somewhat by the end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel is a unique mix of nostalgic, paranormal, and surreal elements, drawing comparisons to *Home Video* and *WandaVision*. It resonated with me during a specific creative period, though my overall enjoyment didn’t quite match my initial excitement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

There’s a significant plot point involving the girls’ ability to perform a pivotal supernatural act, but it lacks explanation. No one ever explains how, why, or where this ability comes from—they just do it, and that’s mostly that. This lack of detail makes it feel like chapters are missing, leaving the plot feeling incomplete.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I enjoyed the book and found it engaging, the lack of explanation for key plot elements and the feeling of missing chapters made it seem more like an outline than a fully developed novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The concept has a strong Night Vale/Alice Isn’t Dead vibe, which I loved.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - The pacing felt off from the start. There wasn’t enough time to get to know the characters before diving into the action. More backstory about the street and the surrounding town upfront would have helped. Excerpts from newspaper articles could have been an effective way to provide context.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - The relationship between Talitha and Brett felt unnatural and lacked depth. It seemed more like a plot device than a genuine connection. I couldn’t understand why they fell in love.\n   - The two brothers were never referred to by name until the very end, which was confusing. Either naming them earlier or consistently calling them “Grace’s brothers” would have been better.\n\n- **Writing Style and Details:**\n   - The word “sallow” was overused, which became noticeable and distracting.\n   - Brett’s name was misleading; I kept thinking she was a guy, which caused confusion about her character.\n   - The stepdad being named Samuel and the kids’ favorite toy being named Sam was unnecessarily confusing. One of those names should have been changed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the premise was cool and the book had a strong Night Vale/Alice Isn’t Dead atmosphere, the execution fell short for me. Issues with pacing, character development, and some distracting details made the storytelling less effective than it could have been.

            "The first-person perspective limited the storytelling, rendering it abstract and disconnected. Initially intriguing reveals ultimately fell flat, lacking the anticipated impact. While the sapphic romance between Talitha and Brett was a positive element, it felt underdeveloped and introduced too late in the narrative. Establishing their relationship earlier and giving it more attention could have enhanced its emotional depth. The main conflict involving Talitha's mother and Brett's stepdad was weak and poorly executed; the story would have benefited from a deeper exploration of abuse and homophobia, with Talitha and Brett taking more decisive actions. Additionally, the redemption arc for Talitha's mother felt unearned and out of place. Although the novel presented an interesting premise, it ultimately felt like a rough draft in need of further development, leaving the story feeling thin and underexplored, especially given its short length of fewer than 250 pages.",
            "While Talitha and Brett were well-developed, most other characters felt flat and underdeveloped. Jack came across as a one-dimensional ghost researcher, Sophie seemed to exist solely for rescue, Grace felt irrelevant, and Enid added confusion as a magical element. The story would have greatly benefited from a deeper exploration of Talitha and Brett's relationship and backstories.",

While the relationship between Brett and Talitha is central to the story, Brett's family dynamics feel extraneous and detract from the overall plot.",

Furthermore, while the female characters are meant to be in their 40s, their behavior often feels immature. This may have been an intentional choice to highlight their lack of growth, but it ultimately added to my frustration with the narrative.",

Its residents, ghosts trapped in a time loop, endlessly relive their pasts, while time itself behaves oddly within the town's borders. The pervasive shadowy darkness that follows the characters enhances the eerie atmosphere, making for a compelling read."

The idea of a town inaccessible to everyone except three women who escaped when the town was covered by a veil is intriguing. The town's residents are ghosts stuck in the past, doomed to repeat their days endlessly, and time behaves strangely within its boundaries. The shadowy darkness that follows the characters adds to the eerie atmosphere.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding and Explanation:**  \n  While the worldbuilding is unique and filled with sci-fi elements, the execution falls short. The rules of the town and the mechanics of the veil are not clearly explained. There needed to be a more fleshed-out explanation for why the town is under the veil and how its strange phenomena work. The explanations provided were too thin and generalized, leaving many questions unanswered.  \n\n- **Character Development and Behavior:**  \n  The story spends a significant amount of time focusing on the relationships of the female main character (FMC), Talitha, but this comes at the expense of exploring the town's mysteries. Additionally, the FMCs are supposed to be in their 40s, but their behavior doesn't reflect their age. While this might have been intentional to show they \"never grew up,\" it added to my frustration with the story.  \n\n- **Plot Focus and Pacing:**  \n  The plot heavily emphasizes the FMC's personal journey and relationships, which detracts from the potential to fully explore the town's backstory and the reasons behind its haunting state. This imbalance left me wanting more depth and clarity about the town itself.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel has a fascinating and unique premise with its eerie, inaccessible town and ghostly residents. However, the execution struggles with underdeveloped worldbuilding, insufficient explanations, and a focus on relationships that overshadows the town's mysteries. While the concept is strong, the lack of clarity and depth in key areas made the story frustrating to read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.75/5 – Points for the unique \"weird town\" concept."

It felt like the author wasn’t sure which direction to take the story, which made the pacing uneven.  \n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I think the book could have been stronger if it focused more on the town and the haunting, fleshing out those elements further. Instead, the story seemed to lose its way.  \n\n- **Character Behavior:**  \n  The behavior of the researchers and Jack felt unnatural, to the point where I expected a big twist that never materialized. This made their actions seem out of place and unsatisfying.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n  The romance felt forced and detracted from the main ghost story. It didn’t add much to the narrative and took away from the atmosphere and tension.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some promising elements, such as its thematic depth and initial writing quality, it ultimately fell short due to uneven pacing, underdeveloped plot points, unnatural character behavior, and a forced romance subplot.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Title and Theme:**  \n  The book should be titled *'The Lesbian Relationship of Velkwood'* because the story primarily revolves around the relationship between the characters Brett and Talitha. The supposed haunting or supernatural element is entirely absent.  \n\n- **Plot and Content:**  \n  The plot was disappointing and lacked the promised haunting or ghostly elements. Instead, it focused on a group of kids who committed a murder and their infatuation with each other. The story felt shallow and unengaging.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Brett and Talitha, were unlikable and unrelatable. I found myself wishing they would disappear along with the neighborhood, as they added no value to the story.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  Reading this book felt like a waste of time. The story failed to deliver on its premise and left me frustrated. I would strongly advise others not to invest their time in it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a letdown, focusing on a shallow relationship rather than the haunting or supernatural elements it seemed to promise. The characters were unlikable, and the plot was unengaging, making the entire reading experience feel like a waste of time.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The plot felt underwhelming, and by the 40% mark, there was little to engage with. Although it included elements of magic and touched on themes like strained parental relationships, these aspects weren't enough to captivate my interest.",
            "The author vividly describes Brett and Talitha, leading me to envision them as wrinkled, saggy old women, despite their likely average age of 40. In contrast, characters like Enid and Grace feel underdeveloped, coming across more as acquaintances than close friends of Talitha. Overall, the story suffers from a lack of substantial character development.",
            "While I recognize that some readers may appreciate the story and the author's writing style, it ultimately didn't resonate with me.",
            "The story centers on a street where all the residents mysteriously disappear, leaving only three girls behind. One of them returns 20 years later to conduct a research project. While the premise is intriguing, it ultimately didn't resonate with me."

Retrospectively, it sounds like an interesting concept, but it didn’t resonate with me personally.  \n\n- **Character Descriptions and Development:**  \n   - The author’s descriptions of Brett and Talitha were vivid enough that I pictured them as \"wrinkly, saggy old women,\" even though they are likely average 40-year-olds.  \n   - Other characters, like Enid and Grace, felt underdeveloped and could have been portrayed as mere acquaintances of Talitha rather than close friends. There was a lack of heavy character development overall.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The plot was underwhelming, and by the 40% mark, there was still very little to hold onto.  \n   - While there are elements of magic and hints of other themes, such as strained parental relationships, these aspects weren’t enough to make the story engaging for me.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Appeal:**  \n   - I acknowledge that some readers might enjoy the story and the author’s writing style, but it didn’t work for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has an intriguing premise and some vivid descriptions, the lack of character development, slow pacing, and underwhelming plot made it difficult for me to connect with the story.
