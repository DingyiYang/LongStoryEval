            "Autumn is a multifaceted character—strong, kind, naïve, wise, and a trauma survivor. Her purple hair and distinctive markings set her apart as an outcast among her people, yet she possesses untapped power and limitless potential. Her bond with Raven’s coven is natural and endearing, as they fiercely protect her and seek revenge against those who have harmed her. Ariel steps into a big sister role, adding depth to the narrative. Autumn’s seamless integration into Rain’s coven is gratifying. In comparison to Isobel, Autumn is a more engaging character. While Isobel does become more relatable, there's a sense that Rain deserves a better coven.",
            "This story is a wonderful addition to the Ariel Kimber universe. Raven and his coven are the ideal protectors for a forest witch."

Her journey from being an outcast to finding safety and belonging with Raven’s coven is both compelling and heartwarming. The forest witches’ lore is intriguing, and the relationships between characters are well-developed. While Isobel’s character didn’t resonate as strongly, the story as a whole is deeply satisfying and a must-read.",

            "Wow! This book is an amazing addition to the series and quickly became one of my favorites. The author consistently captivates me, and this story is no exception. It follows Autumn, a forest witch mistreated by her peers. When Rain sends Raven and his coven to investigate troubling reports, they discover Autumn barely clinging to life. They rescue her and bring her back to their home, where she forms a bond with Raven and his group. I’ve been rooting for them to find a girl since we first met them, and I’m thrilled they finally did! Although Autumn starts off shy and reserved, she gradually comes out of her shell.",

            "In this story, Autumn is deeply influenced by her community's strict rules, leading her to believe she must return to them and that communicating with those trying to rescue her is a betrayal. Initially overwhelmed by basic necessities, she quickly embraces simple comforts like food and hot water. Rain's intensity, while strong, stems from a place of genuine care. From the moment they discover her, her newly formed coven is fiercely protective. Interestingly, while I typically associate the name Raven with girls, I find it more fitting as a boy's name in this context.",
