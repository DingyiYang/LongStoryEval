The heist itself is also very simplistic, which could have been less of an issue if the writing had been more elaborate.  \n\n- **Romance Development:**  \n  The romance was a disappointment. While I typically enjoy best friends-to-lovers stories, this one lacked depth. We don’t learn much about the main characters’ history as best friends beyond how they met, and since the story takes place over a few days, there’s little room for development in the present timeline.

Esme’s longing for a serene cottage life with her cats, the Moulin Rouge-inspired club, the enchanted fae kingdom, dragons, and the heartfelt queer representation all stood out. However, the narrative occasionally felt more focused on ambiance than on substantive plot development.",

I loved the imagery of Esme and Sybil living in a clock tower surrounded by books, old clocks, and cats. Esme’s desire for a quiet cottage life with her cats, the Moulin Rouge-inspired club, the magical fae kingdom, dragons, queer representation, and the mutual queer pining were all highlights.

The setting, which includes a journey through Fae, is vividly portrayed and adds depth to the story.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The character development exceeded my expectations for a 300-ish page book. Sybil, the poster thief, and Esme, her roommate with a penchant for taking in strays, are intriguing and mysterious characters. Their growth throughout the story was well-executed and added to my enjoyment.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The prose is beautiful and enhances the storytelling. Fans of well-crafted writing will appreciate the way the story unfolds and the journey it takes you on.\n\n- **Plot and Resolution:**  \n  While the book is a standalone, there were a few plot points that I felt could have been tied up more neatly. However, this did not significantly detract from the overall storytelling or my enjoyment of the book.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I had a very enjoyable time reading this story. The combination of a sapphic friends-to-lovers romance, a fantastical world, and well-developed characters made for a compelling read.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis sapphic friends-to-lovers romantasy offers a beautifully described world, intriguing characters, and engaging prose. While a few plot points could have been resolved more thoroughly, the overall storytelling and character development made for a highly enjoyable reading experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "I picked up this book initially drawn in by its beautiful cover art and sapphic representation. While the cover remains stunning, the portrayal of the relationship between the main characters, Esme and Sybil, fell short for me. Esme felt overly submissive, often allowing her love for Sybil to overshadow her own needs, which was frustrating. Sybil, in contrast, came across as impulsive and reckless, frequently acting without considering the consequences, leading to numerous conflicts. Their dynamic felt toxic, as Sybil alternated between blaming Esme for her brother’s loss and internally professing her love without ever expressing it outwardly. \n\nThe plot was further undermined by questionable character decisions. For example, despite being warned by Lucien (Sybil’s brother) about Maeve’s deceit, Esme still handed over the jewels, only to be shocked when Maeve’s true intentions were revealed. This lack of critical thinking made the characters feel unrealistic and frustrating.",
            "The romantic tension between Esme and Sybil often felt excessive and poorly timed, particularly during critical moments. For instance, while one of them was bleeding out from a fatal wound, thoughts of longing like, “I really want to kiss her,” came off as jarring and inappropriate. While romantic pining can be endearing, this portrayal was ultimately off-putting."

            "The plot feels loose and lacks substantial conflict, with events unfolding too conveniently to be believable. For instance, it's hard to accept that two seventeen-year-old girls could steal a Fae queen's jewels in under two days. While I appreciate heist novels and am open to suspending disbelief for enjoyment, this particular story fell short for me.",
            "The romance was enjoyable but ultimately forgettable. The recurring theme of \"I want to kiss her, but I don't want to ruin our friendship\" felt repetitive and overused. While the characters were generally likable, they could have benefited from deeper development. I appreciated the explicit bisexual representation in Sybil and interpreted Esme as autistic, though I'm uncertain if that was the author's intention.",
            "This novel beautifully captures the whimsy and glamour of 1890s Paris. The seamless integration of magic and Fae creates a captivating world that I would love to explore. The vibes are immaculate, and the author excels at bringing this enchanting aesthetic to life."

The incorporation of magic and Fae into this setting is seamless, creating a world I’d love to visit and spend time in. The vibes are immaculate, and the author has done a fantastic job of bringing this aesthetic to life.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The plot is loose and lacks significant conflict. Many events happen too conveniently and coincidentally, making them hard to believe. For example, it’s unrealistic that two seventeen-year-old girls could successfully steal a Fae queen’s jewels in less than two days. While I enjoy heist novels and am willing to suspend disbelief for fun, this plot didn’t work for me.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was fine but not particularly memorable. The recurring theme of “I want to kiss her but I don’t want to ruin our friendship” became repetitive and felt overused throughout the novel.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were mostly fine but could have been more developed. I appreciated the explicit bisexual representation in Sybil and interpreted Esme as autistic, though I’m unsure if that was the author’s intention.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Absinthe Underground* is a cozy sapphic novel with a strong aesthetic and setting but a plot that ultimately falls flat.

            "In this story, the primary characters, Sybil and Esme, are hardworking individuals with contrasting personalities—Sybil is reckless, while Esme is overly cautious. Their relationship unfolds from friendship to romance, marked by subtle affection and stolen glances. Though there are charming moments, their compatibility can feel inconsistent. Additionally, both characters lack substantial growth, both as individuals and as a couple. The supporting character, Lucien, adds intrigue, leaving me wanting to see more of him.",

The comparison to Holly Black’s works in the pitch is also well-deserved, adding to the immersive atmosphere.  \n\n- **Tropes and Themes:**  \n  The sapphic friends-to-lovers trope is a highlight, and I find it to be doubly underrated in fiction. The dynamic between the characters, including a year of mutually oblivious pining before the events of the book, feels authentic and relatable, especially within sapphic relationships.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book moves quickly, often feeling shorter than its four hundred pages. This is likely due to the fact that all but the last chapter take place within a span of about forty-eight hours. The fast pacing enhances the slow-burn nature of the romance, making it even more compelling.  \n\n- **Ending:**  \n  The ending felt a bit too much like a Deus Ex Machina for my taste. While it made sense upon reflection, it wasn’t a choice I initially liked. However, the extensive presence of cats in the story more than made up for this, adding charm and enjoyment.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite my minor critique of the ending, I would definitely recommend this book for its engaging atmosphere, well-executed tropes, and delightful elements like the cats.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating blend of magical atmosphere, authentic sapphic romance, and fast-paced storytelling. While the ending may feel a bit contrived, the overall experience is highly enjoyable and memorable, making it a book I’d readily recommend.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story comes across as juvenile, and the writing style fails to convince me that the characters could realistically partake in a heist within the world of Fae. The rapid sequence of events hampers immersion in the fairy elements, and I struggled to envision a gullible fairy, which further diminished my engagement with the narrative.",
            "Esme serves as an excellent point-of-view character and love interest—pragmatic and level-headed. However, her overwhelming loyalty to her cats and Sybil often lands her in difficult situations. I found Sybil less appealing as both a character and a point-of-view. Though she is cunning and cares for Esme, her impulsive decisions and naivety about working for a living are frustrating. Despite her quick wit, it’s surprising that she still lacks basic understanding after a year of independence.",
            "The belle époque-inspired setting of the Parisian city, Severon, captures the desired atmosphere, but it could benefit from further development.",
            "I appreciated the concept of art nouveau style posters being highly sought after and even stolen for profit."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The book had an intriguing premise and setting, but the execution fell flat for me. While Esme was a strong character, Sybil’s flaws and the juvenile tone of the story made it hard to fully enjoy. The pacing and missed opportunities for plot twists further detracted from my overall experience.",

However, her loyalty to her cats and Sybil felt excessive and led her into sticky situations.  \n  - I didn’t particularly like Sybil as a character or POV. While she’s cunning and cares for Esme, she’s rash in her decisions and clueless about working for a living. Her lack of understanding after a year of independence was appalling for someone described as quick-witted.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story felt juvenile, and the writing style didn’t convince me that these girls could be part of a heist in the world of Fae.  \n  - The sequence of events happened too quickly, making it hard to immerse myself in the fairy aspect.  \n  - I found it difficult to imagine a gullible fairy, which further hindered my engagement with the story.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n  - The cat that snuck into fairy land and turned out to be ordinary felt like a wasted opportunity for a plot twist.  \n  - Sybil’s mother was a significant part of the plot, but the open-ended and nonchalant ending regarding her role was unsatisfying.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had an intriguing premise and setting, but the execution fell flat for me. While Esme was a strong character, Sybil’s flaws and the juvenile tone of the story made it hard to fully enjoy.

Conflicts were resolved too conveniently, resulting in a disjointed recounting of events rather than a cohesive narrative. The lack of depth and resolution left me wanting more. Additionally, the characters often acted without critical thinking; for example, handing over the magic jewels to a suspicious nightclub owner, despite warnings about her deceitful nature, felt unrealistic and frustrating.",

The side characters came off as caricatures, making unrealistic appearances to propel the plot. For instance, Lucien's off-screen escape from the fae led to a dramatic but unearned entrance, while Chloe, a seemingly random human, was able to infiltrate the fae and assist the protagonists without any proper groundwork, ultimately finding herself trapped in a realm she wanted to avoid.",
            "The captivating description and stunning cover initially drew me in. Set in a fantastical version of Paris, the story follows two girls in love who struggle to acknowledge their feelings while embarking on a quest to steal fairy jewels for a nightclub owner. The richly imagined setting raises intriguing questions about the city's districts, the peculiar economy centered on stolen posters, the posters' desire to be collected, and the nature of the fae world. Unfortunately, these questions remain unresolved, leaving the world-building feeling incomplete and unsatisfying."

The story is set in a fantasy version of Paris, where two girls in love with each other but refusing to admit it steal posters to make rent before being drawn into a quest to steal fairy jewels for a nightclub owner. The setting raised many intriguing questions, such as the districts in the city, why the economy seems to run on stealing posters, why the posters want to be collected, and the nature of the fae world. However, none of these questions were answered, leaving the world-building feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\n- **Plot Development:**  \n  The plot felt like it was constantly teetering on the edge of something bigger but never fully delivered. Every hurdle was solved too conveniently, making the story feel like a disjointed recount of events rather than a compelling narrative. The lack of depth and resolution in the plot left me wanting more.\n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The relationships in the book felt underdeveloped. Esme and Sybil’s romance was weirdly sexualized and forced, with excessive internal monologuing about their attraction. The side characters were caricatures who appeared at opportune times to unrealistically advance the plot. For example, Lucien breaking out of the fae off-screen for a dramatic entrance, and Chloe, a random human girl who managed to disguise herself in the fae and help the main characters without any buildup, only to end up stuck in the fae where she didn’t want to be.\n\n- **Logic and Consistency:**  \n  There were several moments where the characters’ actions lacked critical thinking. For instance, the decision to hand over the magic jewels to a suspicious nightclub owner without questioning her motives, especially after being warned about her deceitful nature, felt unrealistic and frustrating.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had an intriguing premise and a beautiful cover, it fell short in execution.

While I understand the pining-for-your-best-friend trope, the lack of tension and buildup made their relationship feel underwhelming. I almost cared more about their dream cottage and cozy life than their actual romance.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was fast-paced and low-stakes, which I enjoyed. However, everything wrapped up a little too neatly, leaving me with unanswered questions about the world-building.

The rich descriptions of Esme and Sybil's apartment, along with the magical ball where humans and creatures dance beneath the stars, are truly captivating. The book's cover is equally striking. As the reader's first venture into Fae literature, they appreciated the unique portrayal of fairies, particularly Queen Mab’s powerful and intimidating presence.

The story would have benefited from additional setbacks and twists to elevate the tension and stakes.

They are caught by the club's owner, Maeve, who reveals herself as a Green Fairy and proposes a deal: steal the Faerie Queen's crown jewels before the Spring Equinox. The setting of Belle Époque France, along with the illustrated posters and the Absinthe Underground club, is beautifully crafted and immersive.",

The setting of Belle Époque France, the illustrated posters, and the Absinthe Underground club were all beautifully crafted and immersive.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  I loved the pining between Sybil and Esme, especially as it was a queer relationship. However, I would have liked to see their feelings develop more gradually, with a clearer exploration of why and when they fell for each other. This would have made me more invested in their relationship.  \n\n- **Pacing and Development:**  \n  While the different stages of the heist were great, I felt they could have been more developed. The story could have benefited from more setbacks and twists to heighten the tension and stakes.  \n\n- **Potential for Expansion:**  \n  I would love a sequel, particularly one centered around Hyacinth and Chloe. The Fae world feels rich with potential, and I believe the author could explore it even further.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a captivating read with a unique premise, a beautifully crafted setting, and engaging characters. While I would have liked more development in the heist and the romantic relationship, the story left me eager for more, especially in the form of a sequel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The stakes are high, yet the overall tone remains relaxed and lighthearted. The story follows a faerie imprisoned in the human world who enlists Sybil to steal the Crown Jewels from the Fae in exchange for her freedom.",
            "Sybil's selfishness and immaturity are tempered by her backstory, which sheds light on her behavior. However, her consistent disregard for Esme's preferences and safety is a significant concern. In contrast, Esme is a richly developed character, exuding depth, selfless charm, and a quiet demeanor. The slow-burn, sapphic friends-to-lovers dynamic between Sybil and Esme is filled with mutual pining, adding a delightful sweetness to the narrative.",
            "This novel is delightful, featuring a cozy and whimsical atmosphere enhanced by the presence of charming cats.",
            "This story beautifully blends a 1920s aesthetic with whimsical, cozy fantasy elements."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *The Absinthe Underground* is a cute, simple fantasy novel with a cozy, whimsical tone and a slow-burn sapphic romance. While Sybil’s character could have been more developed, Esme’s depth and the charming atmosphere make it an enjoyable read, especially for fans of Emily Wilde.",

I really enjoyed getting the thoughts and feelings of both protags while the story went, and you don’t get their inner thoughts in the opposite mc chapter.

While the relationship between Esme and Sybil was endearing, it became repetitive due to the constant “I want to kiss her, but it will ruin everything” refrain until the conclusion.

The characters appeared quite young, yet references to Sybil’s numerous “dalliances” felt inconsistent and jarring. Lucien, Sybil’s brother, came across as more of a plot device than a fully realized character, and their sibling relationship lacked depth. Overall, there was minimal character development or growth throughout the story.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Concept and Characters:**  \n  I wanted to like this book, but I couldn’t connect with it. The concept and characters had potential but felt shallow. The characters seemed quite young, yet there were references to Sybil’s many “dalliances,” which felt inconsistent and threw me off. Lucien, Sybil’s brother, seemed like a plot device rather than a fully developed character, and their sibling relationship lacked depth. Overall, there was little to no character development or arcs.\n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was simple, and any challenges the characters faced were resolved too quickly. It felt like an early draft of a story that could have been much deeper and more engaging. The relationship between Esme and Sybil was sweet, but it became repetitive with constant “I want to kiss her, but it will ruin everything” moments until the very end. I would have loved more detail about their current lives and feelings for each other.\n\n- **Atmosphere and Coziness:**  \n  I did enjoy the atmosphere, and there were cozy moments that I appreciated. However, I wished there had been more depth and coziness throughout the story.\n\n- **Cover and Unique Plot Element:**  \n  The cover was appealing, and I found the poster-stealing plot intriguing. It inspired me to search for history books on the subject.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had some charming elements, such as the atmosphere and the unique poster-stealing plot, it fell short in character development, depth, and emotional engagement. The repetitive relationship dynamics and shallow characters made it difficult to fully enjoy the story. It felt like a promising draft that needed more refinement.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n2.5 stars rounded up to 3."

The fact that they’re both women has nothing to do with them not getting together yet, which I appreciate seeing in this kind of book.  \n\n- **Representation and Setting:**  \n  A lot of books that are reminiscent of olden-day time periods will have societies that are more homophobic towards queer main characters, but not this one.  \n\n- **World Building:**  \n  The book was missing world building. There was a lot that wasn’t explained.  \n\n- **Character Development (Supporting Characters):**  \n  There was a lack of character development for the other characters.  \n\n- **Villain Depth:**  \n  The villain’s motivation was super typical and just about wanting power for no actual reason, which is where the story fell flat.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some shortcomings in world building, character development for supporting characters, and the villain’s depth, this book was an enjoyable and engaging read with a refreshing take on queer representation and a delightful dynamic between the two main characters.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This made the story feel less challenging for the protagonists.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt that both main characters lacked significant growth or development throughout the story. However, I appreciated Esme’s bravery in stepping out of her comfort zone, especially given her initial reluctance to leave her apartment filled with cats.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was enjoyable and felt more like a cozy fantasy than a high-stakes adventure. It was a pleasant read, though not particularly groundbreaking.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel excelled in creating an immersive setting and offered a refreshing take on fae lore, the plot’s convenience and limited character development held it back from being exceptional. It was a cozy and enjoyable read, but not without its shortcomings.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The heist feels underdeveloped. Although there are four items to steal, most are acquired too easily and quickly, which diminishes the stakes. The concept of a pre-Faerie heist could have been streamlined to focus solely on Lucien's journal, as the execution lacks depth and energy.",
            "The story showcases immense potential, with a compelling concept and well-crafted characters. While Sybil and Esme are vibrant and engaging, I found myself wanting to explore their pasts—both together and apart—to better understand the depth of their devotion to one another.",
            "The setting aims to evoke the charm of Paris, referencing artists like Mucha and Toulouse. However, these details occasionally feel misplaced, altering the overall impression. The transition to Faerie is too abrupt, and the introduction of the courts seems superficial, possibly because readers who haven't immersed themselves in the author's previous book may find the magic system underexplained.",

The characters are vibrant and fun to read about, but I wanted to know more about Sybil and Esme's past, both with and without each other, and what led them to be so devoted to each other.\n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The setting tries to evoke Paris, with name-drops like Mucha and Toulouse, but the detail sometimes feels out of place, shifting the perception. The transition to Faerie feels rushed, and the setup of the courts comes across as shallow, possibly due to not having read Pacton's previous book, which likely elaborated on the magic system.\n\n- **Heist Plot:**  \n  The heist feels underdeveloped. While there are four items to steal, most are obtained too easily and quickly, making the stakes feel low. The idea of a pre-Faerie heist could have been simplified to just Lucien's journal, as the execution lacks depth and energy.\n\n- **Imagery and Creativity:**  \n  There are enjoyable elements, such as the imagery of the setting, the concept of absinthe made from Fae gems, and the doors between worlds. However, I wish more had been done with these creative ideas to fully realize their potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel has a strong concept, vibrant characters, and creative imagery, it falls short in execution. The setting feels inconsistent, the heist lacks depth and stakes, and the characters' backstories are underexplored.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Engagement and Relatability:**  \n  The book starts with a nod to Oscar Wilde, which immediately caught my attention. I was engaged from the beginning and found Esme, the protagonist, highly relatable. Like me, she’s a homebody who prefers reading and cuddling her cats over grand adventures. Her journey, sparked by a charming thief named Sybil, felt like a cozy yet intriguing call to adventure, reminiscent of Bilbo Baggins’ transformation.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The story was incredibly easy to read, with a plot that chugged along without delay. However, the stakes felt low, almost making it a cozy fantasy. While this made for a pleasant read, I think a bit more drama or tension could have kept me more invested.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Repetition:**  \n  The writing was accessible, but there was a lot of repetition, particularly with words like “clock” and “cat.” This became noticeable and slightly distracting. Additionally, a few spelling errors and formatting issues occasionally pulled me out of the story.  \n\n- **Representation and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated the inclusion of wlw (women-loving-women) pining and relationships in a fantasy setting. It’s a niche that needs more representation, and I’m glad this book exists. I hope it finds its way to readers who will love it deeply.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable, easy-to-read fantasy with a relatable protagonist and a cozy, low-stakes plot. While it could have benefited from more drama and less repetition, its charm and representation make it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

            "The romantic tension between the two main characters came across as cheesy and unrealistic, especially in the context of their life-threatening situations. Their interactions often undermined the plot's stakes. While the heist concept had great potential, the execution felt rushed, with complications resolved too quickly, rendering the stakes almost nonexistent. This pacing issue detracted from what could have been a captivating blend of world-building and action. Additionally, the antagonists were cartoonish, and the plot twists predictable, which ultimately diminished the story's overall impact.",

I love this immersive fantasy world inspired by 1890s Paris.  \n  The Fae elements felt both magical and otherworldly, which I find I really like as well. The magic elements were used in very cool ways in connection with the plot.\n\n- **Characterization and Dynamics:**  \n  The chapters alternate point-of-view, flipping back and forth between Esme and Sybil’s perspectives. Esme is organized and orderly. Sybil is pure creative chaos, but somehow, the pair really works. I liked the differences between them and watching them navigate those differences in their friendship and as participants in a dangerous heist.\n\n- **Romantic Arc:**  \n  The girls pine for one another a lot throughout the story, which was okay, but sometimes felt a little bit distracting from the other elements. The romantic arc progressed perfectly, though. I loved that– it’s so sweet.\n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  All in all, this is another hit for me with this author. I think fans of Julie Kagawa’s Iron Fae series or Roshani Chokshi’s The Gilded Wolves books will very much enjoy this one.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a captivating and immersive fantasy with a richly built world, compelling character dynamics, and a sweet romantic arc. Fans of similar fantasy series will likely find this book highly enjoyable.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)  \n\n**Note:** I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

There, she meets Esme, a working-class girl who invites her to stay, sparking a fast friendship and unspoken romantic feelings between them. Their adventures include stealing posters, encountering magical green fairies, attending a Spring Equinox ball in the Fae lands, and befriending charming companions like dragons and a kitten named Oliver.",
            "Sybil and Esme are endearing protagonists, and their heartfelt longing for one another is palpable. The alternating perspectives enrich their connection, but the romance and many supporting characters come across as one-dimensional, lacking deeper development.",

            "The story had the potential to explore the Moulin Rouge-esque vibe it promised. I longed for more vivid descriptions of Severon and the club, which could have captured the wild, drunken, and slightly eerie atmosphere of a crowded party where the line between human and fae blurs. The La Belle Époque setting, the clock tower apartment, and the promise of a heist initially captivated me.",

The stakes felt low, as characters often escaped precarious situations through sheer luck and timing. Certain elements, such as the museum heist, demanded a significant suspension of disbelief.

Her relationship with Esme is particularly complex; while Sybil insists that Esme loves her, she frequently involves Esme in unwanted situations, raising doubts about the authenticity of their bond. Sybil's deception regarding her past further complicates their dynamic. The book excels in its queer representation, adding a refreshing twist to the familiar themes of faeries and magic.

            "The heist plot was enjoyable, but I wished for more early tension. The characters faced only minor setbacks, which made the story feel more like it was catering to their desires than being driven by their choices. While this is a common issue in YA/teen literature, it didn't significantly detract from the experience. The twist at the end was a nice surprise, leaving me eager for more, as there’s great potential for continuation.",
            "The sapphic friends-to-lovers storyline was both tender and charming, adding a heartfelt dimension to the narrative. I found this development to be one of the book's strongest elements. However, the first 20% of the book was a struggle for me. Sybil came across as insufferable and oddly cruel to Esme, despite professing her love. This felt less like a character flaw and more like poor writing, as if the author intentionally portrayed the characters in a comically negative light to emphasize their growth later. The beginning also felt like filler, making it difficult to engage with the story. Fortunately, after the 20% mark, the book improved significantly. The characters became more nuanced and compelling, and I finally began to root for Sybil and Esme.",
            "The settings in this story are breathtakingly vivid and intricately detailed. I never found myself needing to reread passages due to misunderstandings, a common issue I encounter with other fantasy novels. The author masterfully transports readers from one vibrant location to another, especially during the first visit to the Absinthe Underground. The portrayal of the 1890s club scene is particularly memorable and immersive, engaging all the senses.",
            "I believe this book would have benefited from a different marketing approach. The emphasis on supposed similarities to Moulin Rouge and Holly Black is misleading and does a disservice to the story. At its core, it's a captivating heist narrative featuring portal magic that transports readers to a vibrant fae world, along with a charming sapphic friends-to-lovers romance. I entered with different expectations and was pleasantly surprised, though I recognize that others may not share my experience."

The characters became more fleshed out and interesting, and I finally started rooting for Sybil and Esme.  \n\n- **World-Building and Descriptions:**  \n  The settings were breathtakingly vivid and incredibly detailed. I never had to reread passages because I’d imagined something wrong, which often happens to me with other fantasy books. The author did an excellent job of transporting readers from one vibrant setting to another, especially during their first visit to the Absinthe Underground. The depiction of the 1890s club scene was particularly memorable and immersive, engaging all the senses.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The heist plot was enjoyable, though I would’ve liked more tension early on. Things seemed to go right for the characters at every turn, with only minor, inconsequential setbacks. This made the story feel like it was molding to the characters’ desires rather than being shaped by their choices. However, this is a common issue in YA/teen books, so it wasn’t a major drawback. The twist toward the end was a nice touch, and I found myself wishing for a sequel, as there’s so much potential for continuation.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The sapphic friends-to-lovers storyline was tender and cute, adding a heartfelt layer to the story. I really enjoyed how it developed and felt it was one of the book’s strongest aspects.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite a rough start, this book grew into an incredible story with vivid world-building, engaging characters, and a sweet romance. The beginning could have been stronger, but the majority of the book was well-crafted and immersive. The twist at the end left me wanting more, though it works well as a standalone.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.25 ⭐️"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Characters:**  \n  I almost instantly loved Sybil and Esme. They had fun personalities and worked well together. It was easy to believe they were real friends, not just friends because they roomed together. I rooted for them to be together long before they actually were, which is rare for me in friends-to-lovers stories. Pacton writes characters so well that you can tell she loves them and had fun writing their journey, making it easier for me to like them too.  \n  - **Comparison to Previous Work:**  \n    With *The Vermillion Emporium*, I took a while to like the characters, but with this book, I connected with them almost immediately.\n\n- **Friends-to-Lovers Trope:**  \n  I’m not mad that it’s friends to lovers! I usually have to either really like the author or the trope has to be done well for me to enjoy it, and both applied here. I appreciated how the transition from friendship to romance felt natural and believable. I don’t like how the trope often suggests that friendships are bound to be ruined by crushes, but this book handled it well.  \n  - **Trope Preference:**  \n    Most of the friends-to-lovers books I’ve read are m/f relationships, so maybe that’s the issue (or the solution: don’t read m/f friends-to-lovers haha).\n\n- **World-Building and Descriptions:**  \n  The descriptions made me feel like I was in the book, which is something I always hope for but don’t always get. Pacton is amazing at this, and it’s easy to feel immersed in her novels. I wanted to spend more time in this book—in either realm—so I was sad when it ended. The descriptions elevated the plot, making it impossible not to be entranced by the story.\n\n- **Plot and Writing Style:**  \n  Pacton doesn’t slack when it comes to her plots. The story was well-written, and I wasn’t bored while reading. The descriptions added depth to the plot, making it even more engaging.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  I’ve really begun to like Parker’s narration. You can tell she’s passionate about the characters and the story, even when sped up. That’s what I look for in audiobook narrators—I want to hear that they’re enjoying it and that it’s not just a job for them. I’m excited to explore more of her work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a sweet and enjoyable book that excelled in character development, world-building, and the friends-to-lovers trope. Pacton’s writing and Parker’s narration made the experience immersive and engaging. I was sad when the book ended and would love to spend more time in its world.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The world-building in both 1800s France and the Fae Kingdom fell short for me.

The Fae realm felt underdeveloped and failed to enrich the narrative.

Sybil's manipulation of Esme into risky situations feels more abusive than endearing. The absence of clear character development and nuance hampers any emotional connection with them. The sapphic friends-to-lovers trope, which held promise, ultimately falls flat due to a lack of genuine chemistry and depth.

            "The romance between Sybil and Esme unfolds as a slow burn—soft, sweet, and ultimately rewarding. This gentle aspect of the story enriches the characters and their journey. However, Sybil's penchant for keeping secrets felt more distracting than impactful. While I recognize that these secrets were intended to create tension and delay the romance, they lacked the necessary weight to enhance the narrative.",
            "This book is a beautifully crafted work, featuring vibrant and intricate writing that complements its stunning cover artwork. The lush descriptions bring to life everything from The Absinthe Underground nightclub to the enchanting Fae realm and its Equinox celebrations. Even the small, dusty apartment in a clock tower feels authentic and lived-in, while the misty streets of Paris are so vividly depicted that you can almost feel the dampness on your coat hems.",
            "I believe the book would have been more effective as an adult fantasy rather than a teen one. The characters felt more like young adults, and the narrative tone seemed better suited for a New Adult audience. However, this is a subjective perspective, and there may well be a niche for cozy fantasy aimed at teens."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this is a great addition to the cozy fantasy genre, with a gentle romance and immersive world-building that will comfort readers. While it may not meet expectations for a heist story or resonate perfectly with a teen audience, it’s a lovely and enjoyable read.",

The descriptions are lush and beautiful, from The Absinthe Underground nightclub to the Fae realm and its Equinox celebrations. Even the small, dusty apartment in a clock tower feels real and lived in, and the misty streets of Paris are so vividly portrayed that you feel like you're there, getting the hems of your coat drenched.  \n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance between Sybil and Esme is a slow burn, soft, and sweet, and it pays off immeasurably. It’s a gentle and comforting aspect of the story that adds depth to the characters and their journey.  \n\n- **Character Development and Secrets:**  \n  Sybil’s tendency to keep secrets didn’t add much to the story for me. While I understand it was meant to create doubt and delay the romance, the secrets didn’t feel weighty enough and ended up being more distracting than impactful.  \n\n- **Target Audience and Tone:**  \n  I personally felt the book might have been better suited as an adult fantasy rather than a teen fantasy. The characters didn’t feel like teenagers to me, and the narrative tone seemed more aligned with a New Adult audience. However, this is a subjective feeling, and there may be a niche for cozy fantasy aimed at teens.  \n\n- **Genre Expectations (Heist Story):**  \n  While the story involves stealing precious gems, it’s not a traditional heist story. There’s no elaborate plan, high stakes, or precision schemes—just two girls fumbling around. I appreciated the introspective storytelling focused on the characters, their world, and their emotions, but readers expecting a magic heist might be disappointed.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this is a great addition to the cozy fantasy genre, with a gentle romance and immersive world-building that will comfort readers.

            "This novel seamlessly blends historical France with magic and queer culture, centering on best friends Sybil and Esme as they explore their feelings for one another while participating in a heist led by Maeve, an exiled Fae. The plot revolves around stealing the Crown Jewels from the queen of faerie, adding an exciting twist. Although the depiction of the Fae realm feels familiar, echoing *The Cruel Prince*, the story remains engaging and enjoyable.",
            "The friends-to-lovers trope shines through with the mutual pining between Sybil and Esme, but the romantic tension felt less convincing than I had hoped. While Esme's hints at her feelings were often recognized by Sybil, they seemed to fade from memory too quickly. On a positive note, the story bypasses the coming-out phase, centering instead on the romance itself, which is both refreshing and wholesome. This approach is a welcome change from narratives that dwell on the initial realization of queer identity.",
            "The author's writing style is both compelling and accessible, making the story engaging for readers of all ages. However, the world-building, especially in Severon—the primary setting—felt insufficient. While additional notes at the back of the book offered some context, I would have preferred this information to be woven into the narrative itself."

        "conclusion": "*The Absinthe Underground* is an engaging novel that blends historical France, magic, and queer romance. While the world-building and romantic tension could have been stronger, the story’s approachable writing style and refreshing take on queer representation make it a worthwhile read. It’s a book I enjoyed, even if it didn’t fully meet my expectations.",

The story involves stealing the Crown Jewels from the queen of faerie, which adds an adventurous element. While the land of the Fae doesn’t break new ground and feels reminiscent of *The Cruel Prince*, it was still enjoyable.\n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  Jamie Pacton’s writing style is compelling and approachable for readers of all ages. It makes the story easy to engage with, though the world-building, particularly of Severon (where most of the story takes place), felt lacking.

They were well-introduced, and I got a good sense of who they were from the start. However, I felt their relationship could have been developed further, especially to show more of their dynamic before meeting Maeve. This would have reduced the impression that Sybil took Esme’s friendship for granted.  \n\n- **Setting:**  \n  The setting was one of the strongest aspects of the book. The descriptions of the 1890s city, the glittering Absinthe Underground club, and the cozy clock tower apartment were vivid and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Plot:**  \n  The plot was okay but felt rushed and convenient in places. Some parts seemed more like a first draft than a finished version. The book’s length might have contributed to this, as an additional 50 pages could have allowed for better development of Esme and Sybil’s relationship and a less rushed plot. The timeline felt unbalanced, with most of the story taking place over two days, while the beginning and end covered more extended periods.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I would still recommend this book to those interested in a sapphic friends-to-lovers urban fantasy set in the 1890s. I also appreciated that nothing bad happens to any of the cats in the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book has a compelling concept and strong setting descriptions, but it could benefit from further character and plot development.

Despite multiple opportunities, she chose not to open up to Esme, which made it seem like she didn’t trust her, despite them being best friends.  \n  - I loved the tension in their relationship—how Sybil is impulsive and relies on Esme for backup, while Esme is cautious but always follows Sybil to ensure her safety.  \n\n- **World-Building and Fae Lore:**  \n  - The Fae were intriguing, and I appreciated the establishment of the three main Fae courts and some of the lore/myths surrounding them.  \n  - However, I wish the characters had explored more of the Fae realm, as it felt underexplored.  \n  - I enjoyed the depiction of the Fae as both beautiful and monstrous, which added depth to their portrayal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the plot was predictable and the stakes lacked urgency, I still found the book to be a fun and quick read. The slow-burn romance between Sybil and Esme was a highlight, despite some frustrations with Sybil’s secrecy. The Fae lore was intriguing, though I wished for more exploration of their realm. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, especially for fans of Fae stories and slow-burn romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The plot suffers from significant issues, particularly the implausibility of the characters' actions. Despite their intelligence, Esme and Sybil fail to question the poorly conceived plan to steal the Queen’s Crown Jewels in the Fae realm, which feels unrealistic. While the synopsis hints at an intriguing heist to save the Green Fairy, the execution in the book falls flat. The Fae's sob story and the offer of magic-infused alcohol to persuade the girls come across as seedy and questionable, yet the girls accept it without hesitation. The main plot lacks depth, especially in the first half, which ultimately led me to DNF (Did Not Finish) the book.",

And it was very much worth it!  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n  I absolutely loved the first chunk of the book, especially getting to see the relationship developing between the two main characters and how they live their life. The characters were definitely the highlight of the novel for me. Esme is so relatable, and honestly I just want to BE her. I also really liked Lucien! I loved his personality and I wish we had gotten to see more of him. He was probably my favorite character.  \n\n- **Supporting Characters and Unresolved Arcs:**  \n  There were also some other characters that I wish we’d seen more of. For instance, towards the end of the novel, there is a character named Chloe who I really wished we’d gotten to learn more about, and it felt like her part in the story was left unresolved. I’m really hoping this was intentional by the author and that we might get a book about her in the future.  \n\n- **World-Building and Setting:**  \n  I also really liked the setting! The world was so fascinating and magical, and I wish the author had gone more into the details. I will definitely be reading *The Vermillion Emporium* soon because it’s set in the same world, and I cannot get enough of it. I also believe there is a character in that book that appears in *The Absinthe Underground*, and I just HAVE to know who it is.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I will say that the climax felt a little short-lived, and overall, it felt like the stakes weren’t quite high enough, and the characters were able to get away with things unrealistically easily. But honestly, these didn’t really take too much away from the experience.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n  Overall, this was a fun read. If you’re looking for a cozy sapphic fantasy with compelling characters and a magical world, I definitely recommend this!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book lived up to my expectations and delivered a delightful, magical experience with relatable characters and an enchanting world.

While the conclusion works, it comes together too quickly, leaving out some details that could have added depth to the story’s ending.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed the distinct worlds and the charming dynamic between Sybil and Esme. The romance is sweet, though it relies heavily on pining, and the plot’s conclusion felt a bit rushed. Despite this, the story is engaging and well-crafted, with unique elements that keep it fresh.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The pacing of the story felt off, which was surprising given its brevity. The plot followed a linear trajectory—complete this task, then that one, find this item, speak to that person—without any subplots to introduce complexity. The lack of conflict rendered the narrative uneventful, even during the characters' journey to another world. The resolution to the main conflict was overly simplistic, with the primary obstacle being a character's brief imprisonment that conveniently led to a timely rescue. Overall, the limited conflict throughout the story left it feeling underwhelming. The absence of external challenges or subplots diminished the tension and stakes, and even the romance, which could have provided emotional depth, remained largely internal and failed to generate excitement.",
            "Initially, the two main characters, Sybil and Esme, come across as one-dimensional. As the story unfolds, they seem to shift to fit the author's needs, making it challenging to discern their individual voices. The romance, while present, lacks depth; Sybil and Esme begin as friends already in love, so the narrative centers more on their admission of feelings than on the journey of falling in love. This internal conflict drives the romance but ultimately feels somewhat flat.",

The idea of two roommates, Sybil and Esme, navigating their crushes on each other while struggling to make ends meet in a fantasy setting was intriguing. However, the execution didn’t live up to the potential of the premise.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The two main characters, Sybil and Esme, felt one-dimensional at first. As the story progressed, they seemed to morph into whoever the author needed them to be at any given moment. Their voices were very similar, making it difficult to distinguish whose point of view I was reading at times.\n\n- **Romance:**  \n  The romance was okay but lacked depth. Sybil and Esme start off as friends who are already desperately in love with each other, so the story focuses more on them admitting their feelings rather than falling in love. This internal struggle was the primary driver of the romance, which felt somewhat flat.\n\n- **Pacing and Plot Structure:**  \n  The pacing felt off, which was surprising for such a quick read. The plot followed a very linear path (do this, then this, find this, talk to this person) with no subplots to add complexity. The lack of conflict made the story feel uneventful, even when the characters entered another world. The resolution to the main conflict was too easy, with the most significant obstacle being a character getting thrown in jail—a situation that conveniently led to meeting someone who saved the day.\n\n- **Conflict and Tension:**  \n  There was limited conflict throughout the story, which made it feel underwhelming. The absence of external challenges or subplots meant the narrative lacked tension and stakes. Even the romance, which could have provided emotional conflict, was mostly internal and didn’t add much excitement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *The Absinthe Underground* didn’t meet my expectations.

The fae realm, though intriguing, comes across as a generic fantasy world rather than the unique setting I had hoped for.

Their deep bond and willingness to do anything for each other drive the narrative forward.\n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n  The story revolves around a heist orchestrated by Maeve, a fairy who enlists Sybil and Esme to steal moonstone crown jewels from Queen Mab in the Fae realm.

The romance between the characters appeared tacked on, lacking organic development and integration into the narrative, which was disappointing. The ending struck a mean-spirited and odd note, particularly with Esme’s empathy for Maeve’s strained relationship with her mother being introduced and then abruptly dropped. Maeve’s mother’s harsh claim that Maeve would be made “less than nothing” felt jarring and thematically inconsistent. Furthermore, the resolution with Sybil missed an opportunity to delve into deeper emotional and thematic connections, such as Queen Mab's acceptance of Maeve.

The author captured the depictions of teenagers exploring their queer feelings, as well as the conflict between their desire for friendship and their desire for more. However, the character of Maeve felt like a two-dimensional Disney villain, and I really wanted more depth and intensity from her.  \n\n- **World-Building:**  \n  I loved the land of Fae, but I wish more time was spent exploring this world. I’m hoping the author might write another novel or even a novella about Sybil and Esme’s future adventures in Fae. While the story was fun, I sometimes wanted more depth in the world-building and character interactions.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Editing:**  \n  The story was written quite simply, which made it accessible, but I did notice some issues with formatting and editing. I read the novel on Kindle, and the text was all over the place, with sections of a new chapter appearing on the wrong page. There were also some grammar and punctuation issues, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed with another pass from an editor.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I really enjoyed this book for its cozy vibes, likable characters, and engaging queer fantasy heist plot. While there were areas where I wanted more depth—particularly in world-building and Maeve’s character—it was still a fun and heartwarming read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The challenges they faced felt too easy, and it was hard to believe that two inexperienced girls could transition from stealing posters to stealing from a powerful Fae.  \n\n- **Pacing and Plot Complexity:**  \n  After a slow start, the story lacked the intensity or difficulty I expected, especially in the heists and schemes. There were hints of other stories and themes that could have led to amazing plot twists, but they weren’t explored.  \n\n- **Ending and Potential for Future Books:**  \n  The ending is open, leaving room for future books to explore unresolved themes. However, I’m not holding out hope because it’s uncertain whether these will be addressed.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Romance:**  \n  The writing surrounding the yearning and romantic elements was really good.  \n\n- **Target Audience:**  \n  This book is great for readers looking for quick fantasy reads or those who prefer minimal world-building.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I’d recommend this book for its strong gaslamp fantasy atmosphere, engaging romance, and accessibility for readers seeking a quick fantasy read. However, the lack of character depth, overly easy challenges, and unexplored plot potential left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their mission: to steal Queen Mabh's crown jewels from the land of Faerie to produce fairy absinthe. However, the story suffers from a lack of depth and background, with crucial information and plot points only superficially integrated into the narrative. As a result, the plot fails to generate intrigue or foster a genuine investment in the characters' journey.",

Sybil and Esme, the protagonists, are drawn into a scheme involving a nightclub called The Absinthe Underground. They are tasked with stealing the crown jewels of Queen Mabh from the land of Faerie to create fairy absinthe, though a deeper plot unfolds. However, the story lacks depth and background, with key information and story points merely \"sprinkled\" into the narrative. The plot failed to create a sense of intrigue or investment in what would happen next.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Sybil and Esme, the main characters, remain underdeveloped throughout the novel.

While the plot involves a magical heist in the land of Fae, the conflicts felt somewhat superficial. I never felt the characters were in real danger, and most issues were resolved quickly.  \n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  The relationship between the two main characters is cozy and predictable, with little tension. Their bond is heartwarming, and it’s clear where their relationship is headed. The dual POVs allow readers to connect with both characters.  \n- **World-Building and Descriptiveness:**  \n  The book excels in its vivid descriptions, particularly of pastries, clothing, and jewels. These details bring the world of Fae to life and add a layer of charm to the story.  \n- **Tone and Appeal:**  \n  The novel is easygoing and lighthearted, making it a great choice for readers seeking a feel-good story to lift their spirits.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I enjoyed this book for its cozy relationship, charming descriptions, and lighthearted tone. While the conflicts lacked depth, it’s a delightful read for anyone looking for a comforting and magical escape.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Character Depth:**  \n  The character depth was severely lacking. Esme and Sybil both had one key characteristic in common: a hard background (one as a poverty-stricken orphan and the other as a rich girl who ran away from home after her mother's death) that was never really explored for either of them. Esme's other two personality traits were being a quiet homebody and loving cats, clocks, and tea, while Sybil's was simply being \"adventurous!\"  \n  Their relationship was never explored, and their key moments together were either fully cut out or mentioned only in passing. Many of their interactions felt out of character, which is surprising in a book of less than 300 pages where the reader knows the characters less than the author does.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The adventure plot was fun (which is why I’m giving this three stars instead of two), but it was very oddly paced. The story ended with several loose ends, leaving me unsatisfied.\n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  The lesson from this book is to never judge a book by its cover because, while the cover is gorgeous, the writing is far from it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the adventure plot had its enjoyable moments, the lack of character depth, poorly explored relationships, odd pacing, and unresolved loose ends significantly detracted from the overall experience. The beautiful cover was misleading, as the writing did not live up to expectations.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3/5 stars."

            "The unresolved fate of Chloe is a major concern. After her failed escape, she remains trapped in the Fae world, and the characters who promised to return for her never do. The ending feels incomplete; while Sybil and Esme hint at a possible return to the Fae world, they deliberately avoid Queen Mab’s palace, leaving Chloe’s fate hanging in uncertainty.",
            "Sybil's potential as a half-fae character is underdeveloped. I anticipated her journey would reveal more about her fae heritage or unlock hidden powers, but her abilities are confined to summoning a dragon. This lack of deeper exploration into her fae identity represents a missed opportunity for both character growth and plot development.",
            "This delightful sapphic novel offers a cozy fantasy where two girl roommates harbor secret crushes on each other. The dynamic between Sybil and Esme is captivating, leaving me utterly obsessed with their relationship and eager for more."

        "conclusion": "While the novel excels in its sapphic romance and cozy fantasy setting, it falls short in resolving key plot points and fully developing Sybil’s character. The unresolved fate of Chloe and the lack of deeper exploration into Sybil’s fae heritage detract from an otherwise enjoyable story. I remain hopeful for a sequel to address these gaps and further explore the captivating relationship between the characters.",

Their friends-to-lovers dynamic was central to the story, but I wanted more romance—there was WAY more pining than actual romance.

However, I found myself wanting more out of multiple components. I feel like if the author explored this world more, I’d still be inclined to read it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I did actually enjoy this book.

I rooted for Esme and Sybil from page one, and their dynamic (along with their plethora of cats) was endearing.  \n- **Representation and Relatability:**  \n  Esme and Sybil will remind every queer woman of themselves in some small way—whether it’s questioning if feelings are reciprocated, deciding whether to stay friends or pursue something more, or grappling with how long to wait before admitting who you really are.  \n- **Aesthetic and Setting:**  \n  The novel captures the aesthetic of the 1920s, with homages to Mucha and his fellow artists. It blends historical urban fantasy with Fae elements, creating a unique and whimsical world. However, I wished for more grounding in the setting of Severon, with richer descriptions and exploration before diving into the Fae world.  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  While the story was engaging, I felt the plot rushed slightly in the latter two-thirds of the book.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Personal Connection and Inspiration:**  \n  The story of these two sapphic poster thieves has lived in my head for over a decade, and I still can't believe it's actually a book! I was deeply inspired by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings in the Le Lit series for some scenes in the book. This book is a love letter to roommates who adore each other and girls who are best friends but dream of a future together. It's also a love letter to this time of decadence and delight that has always captured my imagination.\n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  *The Absinthe Underground* is solidly fantasy, featuring a green fairy, a heist in fae, fairy palaces and balls, and dragons. However, it also draws a lot from real-world historical elements, which I discuss in detail in the Author's Note.\n\n- **Historical and Cultural References:**  \n  The book includes glittering nightclubs (with a nod to the queer nightclubs) in 1890's Paris, authors, artists, and famous people who consumed far too much absinthe at their own peril, and poster dealers and thieves. It also highlights queer relationships that history has often left out of the narrative but that have always been here.\n\n- **Dedication and Message:**  \n  This book is a small hope for all the queer kids out there now, who, as I say in the dedication, \"deserve the happiest real-life stories, always.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*The Absinthe Underground* is a deeply personal and imaginative fantasy novel that blends historical elements with a love letter to queer relationships and the decadence of a bygone era. It’s a celebration of friendship, love, and the enduring spirit of queer stories.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Genre and Expectations:**  \n  - I didn’t realize this was a YA novel when I requested it, so I adjusted my rating rubric slightly to account for that. It’s been about a year since I last read YA.  \n  - While I expected more of a \"romantasy\" (which I assume means more romance than plot), this didn’t quite fit that mold.  \n\n- **Overall Experience:**  \n  - This was a fantastical and cozy read, perfect for winding down at night. It served as a comforting contrast to the tense thriller I was reading at the time.  \n  - While it was a fun read, it wasn’t showstopping. I’d consider it a comfort read and recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy fantasy to enjoy in the evening.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n  - The pseudo-Paris setting was rich with atmosphere and felt incredibly cozy. I wished we could have stayed in that world longer, especially after the vivid opening scenes.  \n\n- **Romance (Sapphic Relationship):**  \n  - The sapphic romance was sweet and a highlight for me, though it wasn’t as central to the story as I expected.  \n  - I struggled to be convinced by Sybil and Esme’s romance. Since they both started out in love with each other, I never got to understand why or how they fell in love. The lack of pining made their relationship feel less compelling, and I wish we could have seen them falling in love rather than being told about it from the start.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  - The story felt cozy and small, with some action near the end. However, the final action sequence felt rushed, and Sybil and Esme seemed more like onlookers than heroes in their own story.  \n  - Some things felt too easy, which made the read relaxing but didn’t align with the urgency the characters seemed to feel.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a cozy, comforting fantasy with a charming setting and a sweet sapphic romance. While the romance and plot had some shortcomings, it was an enjoyable read overall, perfect for a relaxing evening.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

Still, it’s a comforting and enjoyable read with strong potential.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 rounded up.  \n\nThank you NetGalley and Peachtree Teen for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest review."

The repetitive inner dialogue of \"I want to kiss her, but I don’t want her to hate me!\" made it hard to keep track of which POV we were in.

While the heist story was okay, it didn’t fully deliver on its potential.  \n\n- **Potential for Sequels or Spin-offs:**  \n  I would read a sequel or side-story about Hyacinth and Chloe.

I felt misled by the promotional material.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was cute and light-hearted.
