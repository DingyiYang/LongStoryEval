            "The story was overwhelmed with plot elements, leaving little room for development, which hindered my enjoyment. The pacing felt rushed, and I craved more depth and detail for a satisfying experience. However, the epilogues stood out, presenting a realistic yet hopeful progression for the characters. Conversely, the fiancé's infidelity and the flower note about Everett’s sexual prowess introduced unnecessary drama and discomfort.",
            "I found it difficult to connect with the characters. Dahlia's grief over her mother's death was poignant, particularly when she reaches for her phone to call her mom, only to remember she can't. I appreciated the authentic depiction of grief and mental health struggles. The inclusion of secondary characters like Leo, Everett's best friend, and Dahlia's aunt Gertrude added depth to the story. However, the second-chance romance felt unbalanced; Everett moved on and got engaged while Dahlia remained emotionally tethered to him. I was uncomfortable with Everett professing his love for his fiancé while Dahlia struggled to let go. The disparity in their past experiences—Everett's reputation versus Dahlia's celibacy—made their romance feel less credible. I also felt secondhand embarrassment when Dahlia quickly agreed to dinner with Everett, despite his condescending behavior.",
            "The absence of ages for the main characters was frustrating, particularly given the significant time gap in their relationship. Additionally, the lack of a discussion about STDs was a major oversight, especially considering that Everett's fiancé was cheating with multiple partners. The scene where Dahlia slaps the condom out of Everett's hand felt both irresponsible and unrealistic.",
            "I appreciated the realistic depiction of grief, mental health, and infertility struggles. The epilogues offered a hopeful yet grounded outlook for the characters, which I found appealing. However, the imbalance in their romantic experiences and the rushed resolution left me wanting more.",
            "The reason for their breakup—Dahlia's miscarriage and struggles with infertility—was both understandable and heartbreaking, particularly as she endured her pain alone while Everett moved on. I wished for greater emotional depth and resolution regarding their past and the way they reconnected."
        ],
        "conclusion": "While the book had some emotional moments and realistic themes, the rushed pacing, uneven romantic dynamics, and lack of character development made it hard for me to fully enjoy. The second-chance trope didn’t work well for me, and I felt the story needed more depth and balance to be satisfying.",

It was truly so good and felt like the best second-chance romance I've read in a while, even though second chance isn’t typically my favorite trope.  \n\n- **Character Chemistry and Dynamics:**  \n   - From the start, the tension between Dahlia and Everett was palpable, and their chemistry far surpassed that of Everett and his fiancée. I found it hilarious how it seemed like Everett was just trying to forget Dahlia throughout the novella.  \n   - When they reunited, it was obvious that they still had so much love for each other, and it felt inevitable that they would get back together.  \n\n- **Emotional Depth and Character Development:**  \n   - By the end, I was really happy with their reunion, but I wished we could have seen more of their thoughts and emotions, especially during their struggles with trying to get pregnant.  \n   - While it was cute that they communicated through letters, I think delving deeper into their feelings during those hard times would have added more emotional weight to the story.  \n\n- **Trigger Warnings:**  \n   - The novella includes sensitive topics such as miscarriage and pregnancy problems, which readers should be aware of.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novella was a delightful read, with strong chemistry between the main characters and a satisfying second-chance romance. While I enjoyed the story, I felt it could have explored the emotional depth of the characters more, particularly during their struggles with pregnancy. Overall, it’s a heartfelt and engaging read, though readers should be mindful of the trigger warnings.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

As someone who loves flowers (I even have about 14 tattoos of them!), these details resonated with me.  \n\n- **Tone and Style:**  \n   - The story was sweet and a bit cheesy, with some insta-love/reunion elements.  \n   - It wasn’t too intense, just the right amount of cringe, which I found amusing.  \n\n- **Memorable Lines and Dialogue:**  \n   - Favorite lines:  \n     - “First of all, I was never in relationships with any of those girls. It was purely physical.”  \n     - “Be still my beating heart.”  \n     - “The audacity. The gall. The disrespect. This woman had some f****** nerve.”  \n     - “Then are you cheating?” “I’ve told you to stop psychoanalyzing me.” “Because if you are cheating, best friend or not, I’ll be forced to rip you to shreds.”  \n\n- **Symbolism and Themes:**  \n   - The name Arbor, short for Arborvitae, symbolizes an evergreen tree that’s hardy and viable through all seasons. It’s one of the few trees capable of living forever, which adds a layer of depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel was short and predictable, its charm lay in its sweet, slightly cheesy tone, memorable dialogue, and the delightful floral touches that resonated with me personally.

Their history adds depth to their characters and makes their dynamic engaging.  \n- **Plot Structure:**  \n  The plot of how Everett and Dahlia cross paths again is entertaining. The story is quick and fun, though I felt it could have been longer and more developed to fully explore its potential as a novel-length narrative.  \n- **Pacing:**  \n  For a short read, the pacing works well, keeping the story light and enjoyable. However, I would have appreciated a more detailed and extended exploration of the characters and their journey.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a quick and fun read with an engaging premise and likable characters. While I enjoyed the story, I felt it had the potential to be expanded into a more developed novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."
