            "This book offers authentic representation of transracial adoptees, making me feel truly seen. It beautifully captures the sensation of being a misplaced jigsaw piece—someone who doesn’t quite fit—and delves into the complexities of familial love that transcends blood ties. The representation is seamlessly woven into the narrative, enhancing multiple aspects of the story rather than serving as a mere detail. Unlike many apocalyptic or magical reckoning tales featuring marginalized characters, which often lack depth, this book confronts issues of identity, prejudice, and feelings of alienation head-on, even amidst an apocalypse. It recognizes that these emotions are deeply rooted in memories and relationships, rather than resolving them through magical means. The characters are quirky, authentic, and richly detailed. The author skillfully establishes a profound understanding of Sid and her family, highlighting their nuances, memories, and the love that defines them. Each character is distinct and well-developed, adding to the story's richness.",

It serves as a formidable force, shaped by both the presence of zombies and the dramatic changes unfolding within the story. This dynamic backdrop adds significant depth and intensity to the narrative."

            "The plot was engaging and paced briskly, but the town's history and the origins of the magic felt underdeveloped. Additional details would have enriched the setting and made it more immersive. While the concept of the fault line was intriguing, it ultimately lacked depth and impact. Additionally, the story began to lag, and trimming about 50 pages could have helped maintain its momentum.",
            "In this story, the main character, Sid Spencer, is relatable, which effectively draws the reader in. Most characters are introduced gradually, allowing for deeper connections, but some are hurriedly presented during action scenes, making it challenging to differentiate between them. Brian's family, along with several minor characters, often blends together, leading to confusion about their significance in the narrative.",

As a strong female protagonist, Sid navigates the complexities of life while confronting existential threats.",

While some aspects of the story, like the Sid/Nell/Finn dynamic, were a bit unclear, the overall character development and emotional depth left me wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

Having read numerous Marvel comics with similar themes, I found it less engaging than I might have if I were new to the genre. At times, I wondered if the story might have been better suited as a comic book series rather than a novel."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Initial Engagement and Writing Style:**  \n  The novel started out really strong with a fun and quirky female main character (FMC). The writing was funny and witty, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\n- **Genre and Plot Development:**  \n  Apocalypse and post-apocalypse stories are right up my alley, so I was excited to dive into this ARC. However, after the halfway point, the story began to feel like a typical superpowered teenagers in a magical apocalypse narrative. Having read many Marvel comic books with similar themes, I found it less engaging than I might have if I were new to the genre. At times, I even thought the story might work better as a comic book run rather than a novel.  \n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook narrator, Eunice Wong, was a standout for me. She brought the story to life with her expressive delivery, especially during emotional dialogue and intense scenes. I was genuinely impressed and became a new fan of hers. While I wasn’t a fan of a previous hard sci-fi book she narrated, she did an amazing job with this one.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential and Representation:**  \n  Despite this book not fully working for me, I’m still eager to read more of Robin Wasley’s work. It’s rare to see transracial adoptee ownvoices stories, and I’m excited to follow her career and see what she creates next.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel started strong with a quirky protagonist and witty writing, it eventually fell into familiar tropes that didn’t fully captivate me. However, the audiobook narration by Eunice Wong was exceptional, and I remain enthusiastic about the author’s future work due to her unique perspective and representation.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Genre:**  \n  - The book started as a YA romance but quickly shifted into a mystery/magical world/zombie survival novel, which was unexpected.  \n  - A significant portion of the book focused on zombies (referred to as \"shells\"), which I initially thought would deter me from enjoying it.  \n  - The zombie survival elements eventually took a backseat to the larger, more magical plot, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Magic and World-Building:**  \n  - The magical elements were cool and creative, adding depth to the story.  \n  - The world-building presented numerous obstacles for the main characters to overcome, keeping the narrative engaging.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - There were characters I grew to care about and root for, as well as villains I genuinely loathed (in a good way).  \n  - The inclusion of found family dynamics and cute relationships added emotional depth and charm to the story.  \n\n- **Personal Enjoyment:**  \n  - Despite my initial hesitation about the zombie theme, I ended up thoroughly enjoying the book.  \n  - It was a fun and entertaining read, even if it didn’t become one of my all-time favorites.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this novel surprised me in the best way. While the zombie elements initially made me hesitant, the creative magic, engaging characters, and evolving plot won me over. It was a fantastic and entertaining read, and I’m glad I stuck with it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

A central theme is the strong bond among family members, who are willing to risk everything—even confronting zombies—to protect their loved ones.",

I found myself moved to tears on several occasions, an unexpected reaction for a story centered around zombies.",

            "The story unfolds at a rapid pace, spanning over 500 pages with lengthy chapters. Its primary focus is on thwarting evil and defending against imminent threats, leaving little space for subplots or character-driven narratives. Centered around the dual nature of magic—both wondrous and destructive—the plot is set in a town that has closed its gates to magic and established doubtful guardians. The protagonist, Sid, along with her family, faces a significant challenge when her brother begins to exhibit strange behavior and is selected as a guardian of magic. The tension escalates when someone starts uncontrollably opening the gates to magic, instilling fear and danger in the townspeople.",
            "In this story, 17-year-old Sid, a highly intelligent protagonist, is charged with safeguarding her world from magic. While the side characters, including Sid's brother, contribute depth to the narrative, their development feels somewhat underwhelming.",
            "The title *Zombie (podobno) są martwe* (Zombies Are (Supposedly) Dead) is somewhat misleading, as zombies have a minimal presence in the story. While the book offers light entertainment and serves as a welcome break from heavier themes, it may fall short for those seeking depth or originality. Although marketed as a young adult novel, it also appeals to adult readers by steering clear of typical YA tropes, such as immature protagonists or the pursuit of magical powers. Instead, the narrative focuses on protecting the world from magic rather than exploring it, which may disappoint readers hoping for a more in-depth examination of magical elements."

While the protagonist, Sid, is a standout character, the story falls short in developing side characters and subplots.

The inclusion of zombies in the title intrigued me, but there was too little of that element for my taste, especially as a fan of \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The protagonist, Sid Spencer, is a 17-year-old Korean adoptee living in America.

This might be due to the YA genre, which I don’t typically read much of anymore. However, I still liked the book and would recommend it to others, particularly my students.\n\n- **Audiobook Narration:**  \n  The audiobook fell short for me. The narrator’s voice felt too mature for the story, more suited for an adult novel with characters potentially in their 30s. Despite the narrator’s awards, the voice didn’t align with the teenage characters, and there wasn’t enough variation in tone for different dialogues. I even played a short clip for friends who agreed the voice didn’t match the characters. A younger narrator or a full character cast might have worked better.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  I would recommend reading the physical or ebook version of the book, especially for fans of fantasy and apocalyptic settings. However, I wouldn’t recommend the audiobook due to the mismatch between the narrator’s voice and the story’s tone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Dead Things Are Closer Than They Appear* is an engaging and entertaining read, particularly for fans of YA fantasy.

The plot thickens when the fault line is opened by nefarious individuals, unleashing true horror. Sid is forced to team up with a group of friends to save her town and potentially the world.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  Sid and her ragtag group of friends are well-developed and far from the usual teen character tropes.

A standout character is Chad, a lovable and beat-up female cat who accompanies the group.  \n\n- **Dialogue and Writing Style:**  \n  The dialogue is truly great, adding depth and humor to the story. The writing style keeps the reader engaged, blending adventure with emotional moments seamlessly.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n  The narrator, Eunice Wong, delivers a fabulous performance. Her narration enhances the story, making it a highly enjoyable listening experience.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  The novel is perfect, with a well-crafted plot, memorable characters, and a satisfying mix of adventure and emotion. I would love to read or hear more about their adventures in the future.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a captivating and well-executed dystopian adventure with a unique premise, relatable characters, and excellent narration. It’s a story that balances teen angst with thrilling action and leaves the reader wanting more.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNot explicitly mentioned in the review, but the tone suggests a highly positive rating, likely 5/5."

While there are \"zombies\" in the book, they aren't the main focus.  \n\n- **Magic System:**  \n  The magic system was a standout element.

I enjoyed seeing how characters experimented with their powers to help them grow and evolve, without the stress of getting spells \"right.\"  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The side characters were a highlight for me. Many of them were pragmatic and dealt with their situation realistically, especially when facing someone hunting them. However, I didn’t connect with the main character. She felt like a mix of \"poor me\" and the voice of reason, often looking down on herself, which made her a bit difficult to relate to.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I really enjoyed the book overall.

            "At first, the book appeared to be primarily plot-driven, which initially left me feeling disconnected, as I typically prefer character-driven narratives. However, as I delved deeper, I discovered that it was indeed character-driven, albeit in a subtle manner that only became apparent around 70% through the story. The main character's intentional emotional distance, both from others and herself, initially gave the impression of a surface-level narrative. Yet, as the plot unfolded, it revealed a profound journey of self-discovery. While the characters may not be my favorites, I greatly respect the skill with which they were crafted and developed."

I loved it.  \n\n- **Plot vs. Character-Driven Narrative:**  \n  Initially, the book seemed very plot-driven, which is fine, but my personal preference leans toward character-driven stories. Because of this, I didn’t feel an immediate connection to the book. However, as I continued reading, I realized that it was, in fact, character-driven—just in a very subtle way. This subtlety made it hard to recognize until about 70% of the way through.  \n\n- **Character Development and Depth:**  \n  The main character was intentionally closed off, both to others and to herself. At first, this made the story feel surface-level, but as the narrative progressed, it became clear that we were on a journey of self-discovery together. While the characters aren’t my favorite, I have a lot of respect for how they were written and developed.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Persistence:**  \n  Despite not connecting with the characters right away, I’m so glad I kept reading. The story was really good, and the payoff was worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am excited to read more from Robin Wasley.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a clever and well-written book that initially seemed plot-driven but revealed itself to be subtly character-driven.

Fragments of the system are unveiled gradually, just in time to be useful.  \n\n- **Romance Subplot:**  \n   - The romance serves as a nice B-plot that complements the main action without overshadowing it.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - The focus on the main character’s insecurities and neuroses adds depth and ties the novel together effectively.  \n\n- **Narration (Audiobook):**  \n   - The narrator does an incredible job of making the main character’s voice distinct while also providing complexity and depth to other character voices and the narrative voice. The narration is engaging and easy to listen to.  \n\n- **Standalone Potential and Desire for More:**  \n   - The novel stands well on its own, but I would love to see more stories set in this universe. I’m also eager to check out the author’s previous works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful surprise, blending genres seamlessly and offering a unique magic system, well-developed characters, and a satisfying balance of action and romance. The audiobook narration enhances the experience, making it a highly engaging read. I highly recommend it and look forward to exploring more from this author.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

There were too many new characters being introduced as the action was ramping up, and I didn't really understand what they brought to the story.  \n\n- **Worldbuilding:**  \n  The worldbuilding was lukewarm, lacking depth and immersion.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Aside from a few characters (including the MC and the love interest), I didn't really connect with any character in the book. All the characters seemed to have the exact same sense of humor, which I found jarring.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  The writer had a fresh, funny voice, which I appreciated.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I would maybe read something else by this author, but this book wasn't for me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had a strong start and a unique writing style, it struggled with pacing, character development, and worldbuilding.
