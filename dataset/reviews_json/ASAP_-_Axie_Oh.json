            "This book offers significantly more character development than *XOXO*, particularly with Sori. Her growth in relationships, especially her cautious re-entrance into a romance with Nathaniel, feels both realistic and relatable. Nathaniel emerges as a deeply compelling character; his patience and willingness to sacrifice for Sori are heartwarming, and his emotional moments, particularly when faced with her rejection, resonate strongly. \n\nOne welcome improvement is the increased emphasis on family dynamics. Sori’s relationship with her mother evolves beautifully, especially by the end, adding depth to the narrative. Her dedication to both her mother and Joah makes her character even more endearing. \n\nHowever, Hyeming's role often feels more like a plot device, occasionally frustrating me with her lack of depth—she mainly serves to advance the story without adding substantial value. Additionally, familiar characters from *XOXO*, like Gi-Taek and Angela, barely make an appearance, while Jenny is relegated to offering sporadic encouragement. Though I still love Jenny, I found myself missing the presence of the other characters.",
            "The writing style maintained the consistency of its predecessor, *XOXO*, while showing improved pacing that made it more refined and engaging overall.",
            "I absolutely loved this book, and the sequel exceeded my expectations. It may just be my favorite read of the year. The slow-burn storytelling captivated me, and I enjoyed every moment.",
            "I appreciated the second-chance romance in this book more than the insta-love trope in *XOXO*. The interactions between Sori and Nathaniel felt genuine and included some truly heartfelt moments. The mermaid scene with Nathaniel was especially memorable—it made me gasp, and despite being a common trope, it was executed beautifully."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Despite some minor flaws, *Sorinate* was an incredibly enjoyable read. The improved pacing, deeper character development, and heartfelt romantic moments made it a standout sequel. If you’re a fan of cheery rom-coms with emotional depth, this book is definitely worth reading.",

It might be my new favorite read this year. The slow-burn nature of the story was captivating, and I enjoyed it immensely.\n\n- **Writing Style and Pacing:**\n   - The writing style felt consistent with the previous book, *XOXO*, but the pacing was better and an improvement overall. It felt more refined and engaging.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - There was more character development in this book compared to *XOXO*. Sori’s growth, especially in her relationships, was well-executed.

His patience and willingness to sacrifice for Sori were heartwarming. His emotional moments, like when Sori rejected him, were impactful and made me feel for him.\n\n- **Romantic Elements:**\n   - I preferred the second-chance romance storyline in this book over the insta-love trope in *XOXO*.

Gi-Taek and Angela were only briefly mentioned, and Jenny only appeared to give Sori pep talks. While I still love Jenny, I missed the presence of the other characters.\n\n- **Critiques and Unresolved Questions:**\n   - The book had some logistical problems, and a few of my questions were left unanswered. However, these issues didn’t detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite some minor flaws, *Sorinate* was an incredibly enjoyable read.

These experiences felt like fate connecting me to the narrative."

            "The novel centers on a Korean protagonist, a Korean-American love interest, and a biracial (Korean, white) side character, all crafted by a Korean-American author, which lends authenticity to its cultural representation. Sori's character arc is compelling as she grapples with her parents’ expectations, her personal desires, and her evolving relationship with her mother. Her transformation from aspiring idol to a mentor for Hyemi is well-developed and relatable. Nathaniel’s evolution is equally significant as he seeks to establish his place in the music industry, transitioning from performer to music producer. \n\nThe second-chance romance between Sori and Nathaniel is rich with tension and chemistry, drawing on their shared history and strong on-screen connection to evoke a profound sense of longing. The loaded glances and subtle interactions effectively heighten the romantic suspense. Supporting characters like Jenny, Jaewoo, Hyemi, and Nadine enrich the narrative, with their dynamics providing depth and enjoyment. Hyemi’s ambition to debut reflects Sori’s own past aspirations, reminding her of the joy she once experienced in the industry.",

Sun’s protective older brother dynamic with Sori was intriguing, and I appreciated how he looked out for her in his own way. Their similar backstories added depth and gave off chaebol k-drama vibes.  \n\n- **Writing and Storytelling:**  \n   - Axie’s writing skills have leveled up. The storytelling felt more tightly woven, the beats sharper and cleaner, and the characters even more personable.  \n   - I loved seeing the growth in her writing, and while I enjoyed *XOXO*, I enjoyed *ASAP* even more.  \n\n- **Themes and Genre Appeal:**  \n   - This book is perfect for fans of k-dramas, k-pop, fluffy second-chance romance, forced proximity, and sassy, strong yet soft female main characters.  \n   - The song cameos made my second-gen k-pop-loving heart happy and nostalgic, and the book left me longing to return to Korea.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**  \n   - This was an easy 5-star read for me. I loved Sori and Nathaniel’s love story and can’t wait for a potential third book featuring Sun or Youngmin’s happily ever afters.  \n   - I highly recommend preordering *ASAP*—it’s a must-read!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*ASAP* is a delightful, heartwarming read that builds on the charm of *XOXO* while showcasing the author’s growth in storytelling. With relatable characters, adorable romance, and a nostalgic k-pop/k-drama vibe, it’s a book that will leave you smiling and eagerly anticipating more from the series.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5 stars)"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed the established friendships and the new ones that developed throughout the story. Nathaniel was incredibly sweet and understanding, even amidst his heartbreak, and I loved their chance to reconnect. I also appreciated Sori's mom; I initially expected her to be problematic, but she turned out to be a well-meaning character striving to do her best in a challenging world. In contrast, I absolutely loathed Sori's father—his character was so terrible that I could easily write an essay on his flaws.",
            "This book explores the unfair challenges faced by idols, largely driven by tabloids but primarily stemming from fans' toxic adoration and obsession. It vividly illustrates the negative backlash idols encounter when they enter into relationships, forcing them to conceal their personal lives as if their careers hinge on it—a reality that often rings true. Additionally, it highlights the troubling expectation for idols to apologize for finding love, a burden they should never have to bear. I partially attribute this toxic culture to the idol companies that perpetuate such dynamics.",
            "I absolutely adored this book! It was charming, slightly dramatic, and contained everything I cherish in a story. As a fan of K-drama and K-pop, it truly delighted my heart. I'm thrilled to revisit the world and characters I loved in *XOXO*.",
            "Revisiting this story in March 2024 was just as delightful as the first read. I eagerly anticipate the audiobook version to experience it once more."

        "conclusion": "This book was a delightful read, blending heartfelt relationships, social commentary on idol culture, and emotional depth. It was both cute and dramatic, making it a perfect fit for fans of K-dramas and K-pop. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this world and its characters, and I’m excited to experience it again through the audiobook.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n   - I really enjoyed the friendships that are already established and the new ones that form as the story progresses.  \n   - Nathaniel was super sweet and understanding, even though his heart was breaking. I loved that they got a chance to reconnect.  \n   - I appreciated Sori's mom in this one. I thought she would be problematic, but she wasn’t. She was just trying her hardest to do her best in a difficult world.  \n   - I HATED Sori's father. He was so terrible, and I could write a whole essay about how awful he is.  \n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n   - The book delves into the unfairness that idols suffer, partly due to tabloids but mostly because of fans who have a highly toxic adoration or obsession with their favorite idols.  \n   - It highlights how negatively fans react when their idol is in a relationship, forcing idols to hide and guard their relationships as if their careers depend on it (which they sometimes do).  \n   - The book also touches on how idols often apologize to fans for being in a relationship, which is something they shouldn’t have to do.  \n   - I partly blame idol companies for perpetuating this toxic culture.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n   - I loved this book so much. It was cute, a little dramatic, and everything I love in a story.  \n   - It made my K-drama and K-pop-loving heart happy.  \n   - I’m so glad to be back in this world with the characters I loved from *XOXO*.  \n\n- **Re-readability and Anticipation for Future Formats:**  \n   - Re-reading this in March 2024 was just as enjoyable as the first time.  \n   - I can’t wait to get my hands on the audiobook version so I can experience it again.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful read, blending heartfelt relationships, social commentary on idol culture, and emotional depth. It was both cute and dramatic, making it a perfect fit for fans of K-dramas and K-pop. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this world and its characters, and I’m excited to experience it again through the audiobook.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- No specific numerical rating was mentioned in the review.

Nathaniel perfectly complements her character, being ready to give up everything for her, which creates a compelling dynamic reminiscent of a villain falling for an antihero.

Young-min remains my favorite, and I would love to see a book focused on his charming antics and friendships.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact and Writing Style:**  \n   - The quote, “Let me be your second, third, and fourth love,” alone was enough to make me want to read the book.  \n   - Axie Oh’s writing is beautiful and heartfelt, with phrases like “I feel my heart tumble in my chest” and “The balloon in my chest pops” that perfectly capture emotions.  \n   - The story made my heart break alongside Sori and Nathaniel’s, but also allowed me to fall in love with them.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n   - Sori is a perfect main character with her soft heart and tough exterior, willing to sacrifice everything for her people.  \n   - Nathaniel complements her perfectly, as someone willing to give up everything for her, creating a dynamic akin to a villain falling for an antihero.  \n   - The return of favorite characters like Jenny, Jaewoo, Sun, Angela, Gi Taek, and Young-min was exciting. Young-min remains my favorite, and I’d love a book dedicated to his adorable shenanigans and friendships.  \n   - Sun’s character development was a pleasant surprise; I went from thinking he was a jerk in *XOXO* to becoming a fan. His older-brother dynamic with Sori was endearing, and I’d love to see him find love in a future story.  \n\n- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  \n   - The book perfectly blends glamour (variety shows, K-dramas, K-pop) with quiet, intimate moments, creating a K-drama-like experience in the best way.  \n\n- **Sequel and Continuity:**  \n   - As a sequel to *XOXO*, this book did not disappoint. It delivered the heartfelt and beautiful storytelling I expected, while expanding on the world and characters I already loved.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*ASAP* is a stunning sequel to *XOXO*, filled with emotional depth, captivating characters, and a perfect blend of glamour and intimacy. Axie Oh’s writing shines, making the reader feel every heartbeat and heartbreak. The return of beloved characters and the introduction of new dynamics left me wanting more—especially for Young-min and Sun. This book is a must-read for fans of *XOXO* and anyone who loves a heartfelt, K-drama-inspired story.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "Sori's quest to save her mother's company was truly a standout moment. Her mother’s encouragement for Sori to pursue her own career path was empowering, and when she defended Sori against her father, it was a powerful display of strength.",
            "Sori resonated with me as a character, caught between her desire to support her mother and pursue her own life. Initially fearful that her mother would restrict her choices, Sori found unexpected freedom when her mom empowered her to choose her profession and date whomever she wished, even in front of her father. Although she did not formally divorce him, Sori's mother prioritized her daughter's happiness and aimed to provide the stable family environment she never had.",
            "Nathaniel's moments were truly heartwarming, particularly when he surprised his family at home, only to find a nostalgic surprise waiting for him in his bed with his childhood bear. His commitment to Sori was evident when he assured her he would always answer her calls, and his concern for her well-being shone through when she fainted. Nathaniel's confession of loving Sori since he was 14 added depth to their relationship. Ultimately, he chose not to let Sori stay in his family home, wanting to keep her all to himself."

            "The plot was entertaining, humorous, and engaging, featuring delightful elements such as variety show appearances, bandmate banter, and drama filming. The maknaes, Hyemi and Youngmin, were charming additions. However, the ending felt rushed and anticlimactic. I wished Sori had communicated with her mother sooner, though I understood her hesitation. Some subplots, like Sun's occasional odd behavior, seemed unresolved, yet I was generally satisfied with their outcomes.",
            "I enjoyed Sori and Nathaniel's romance more than I anticipated. Their love, built on a rich history of mutual respect, kept me rooting for them throughout the story. Their chemistry was delightful, and despite the ups and downs, their feelings for each other remained unwavering. It was difficult to view either Nathaniel or Sori as flawed characters; they were both well-developed and genuinely good people who avoided unnecessary drama. Sori stood out as a beautiful, confident, intelligent, and talented character. Reading from her perspective was engaging, and she felt relatable despite her extraordinary life. Nathaniel was equally compelling, and their dynamic felt authentic and mature. I also appreciated the depth of Sori's relationship with her mother, which was realistic and heartfelt, even in her mother's frequent absence.",
            "The writing was enjoyable and light, though it lacked depth. While it effectively conveyed the story, it didn't particularly shine. There were a few minor grammatical errors, such as unnecessary commas, but they did not significantly impact the overall reading experience.",
            "As a Korean American, I appreciated the deliberate use of Koreanisms in the writing, which added authenticity to the story. Terms like SNS (social networking sites) were seamlessly integrated without explanation, creating an immersive experience. The exploration of idol culture and the social expectations surrounding dating in Korea was intriguing, although I found myself unclear on why dating was portrayed as scandalous.",
            "I appreciated the nuanced portrayal of family relationships, which felt more complex and realistic than those in typical YA novels. The themes of gratitude and indebtedness, along with healthy parent-child dynamics, added depth and maturity to the story. The emphasis on Asian and Asian American families struck a personal chord with me."

        "conclusion": "Overall, this was a fun, engaging, and heartfelt read that transported me back to my time in Korea and Japan. The romance between Sori and Nathaniel was compelling, and the cultural details added authenticity.

            "The storytelling kept me on the edge of my seat, particularly in the final episodes. As always, the buildup to the finale was both intense and frustrating.",
            "This novel boasts a cast of compelling characters, each shining in their own way. Hyemi stands out as a sweet and grounded character, demonstrating respect despite her social status. Min Hee, Sori’s mother and CEO of Joah, also leaves a mark. Though she is absent for much of the story, her resilience and determination to protect Sori and her daughter's talents resonate powerfully. \n\nThe chemistry between Sori and Nathaniel is electric. Regardless of their relationship status, the tension and longing between them remain palpable throughout the narrative. Nathaniel's unwavering feelings for Sori are evident in his many small acts of care, which make him irresistibly swoon-worthy. At times, I found myself wanting to shake Sori for her selflessness; her instinct to save everyone she loves, while admirable, often distracts from her bond with Nathaniel. As a reader, I can’t help but root for their relationship to flourish amidst her overwhelming desire to care for others.",
            "ASAP is a captivating read that instantly drew me in—so much so that I knew from the very first chapter it might be a 5-star book! If you enjoyed the first book, XOXO, and have a passion for Korean dramas, this is definitely a must-read."

        "conclusion": "ASAP by the author is a captivating and emotionally charged novel that feels like watching a Korean drama. With well-developed characters, intense romantic chemistry, and a storytelling style that keeps readers hooked, it’s a must-read for fans of the author’s previous work, *XOXO*, and lovers of K-dramas.",

She’s older now, grappling with decisions about her future, and often feels the weight of the world on her shoulders.  \n   - Her family situation and her mother’s company troubles add to her sense of responsibility and internal conflict.  \n   - She’s still deeply in love with Nathaniel, and their inability to be together due to potential scandal is painful.  \n\n- **Romantic Relationship (Sori and Nathaniel):**  \n   - The relationship is significant but not the sole focus of the story. It’s balanced with Sori’s personal growth, career, and family dynamics.  \n   - Nathaniel’s actions, though not from his POV, clearly show he shares the same feelings.  \n   - A small critique: I wish the fallout of their relationship becoming public had been explored more, especially given the shippers’ support.  \n\n- **Career and Professional Growth:**  \n   - The career storyline is engaging and fun, particularly the variety shows and behind-the-scenes moments.  \n   - Sori’s connection with Hyemi is a highlight, and Hyemi is a lovely character.  \n   - I missed Jenny, but her absence felt realistic given the story’s context.  \n\n- **Family Dynamics:**  \n   - Sori’s relationship with her mom is central and well-developed.

            "I appreciated that Sori’s career decision was resolved swiftly without resorting to the cliché of “No Mom, I’m giving up YOUR dream!” The author even humorously acknowledges this trope, which adds to the story's charm. Additionally, I liked how the plot progressed through the public interest in MinLee, rather than focusing on negativity toward Sori.",
            "The story is told from Sori’s perspective, which brilliantly captures the thoughts of an eighteen-year-old girl. At this age, one feels like an adult with life figured out, yet still clings to childhood in many ways. Sori displays a maturity that is evident in her graceful demeanor, but her childlike tendencies emerge in her attempts to help and protect her mother. This aspect of her character serves as a meaningful backdrop for the story's resolution and reconciliation with her mother. Sori is an endearing character, and the details like the plushies on her bed, the bear in Nathaniel's room, and the variety show mascots add charm to her personality. However, I wasn't particularly fond of Hyemi.",

It’s an easy and fluffy read, and I appreciate that the author describes the setting and scenes in such detail because I was completely immersed.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sori):**  \n   - The story was written from Sori’s point of view, and her perspective perfectly captures what goes through an eighteen-year-old girl’s mind. At eighteen, you feel like you’re an adult and have it all figured out, but you're still a child in the grand scheme of things.  \n   - Sori is pretty mature and carries herself gracefully, but her childish tendencies show when she devises plans to help and protect her mother. I thought this was a great way to segue into the resolution and reconciliation with her mother.  \n   - Sori is such a cute character; I love the mention of all the plushies on the bed, the bear in Nathaniel's room, and the variety show mascots.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry (Sori and Nathaniel):**  \n   - I loved the chemistry between Sori and Nathaniel. I wish we got to read more about how their relationship transpires because their dynamic (before officially being together again) is very endearing.  \n   - Their relationship has a great balance of teasing and reassurance. I particularly loved the dialogue when Sori feels silly about looking forward to eating breakfast together, but Nathaniel is quick to apologize and reassure her that he’ll tell her if he has to go somewhere in the future.  \n\n- **Plot and Tropes:**  \n   - I liked that Sori’s career decision was not dragged out and didn’t fall into the trope of “No Mom, I’m giving up YOUR dream!” (even the author calls this out, which was funny).  \n   - I appreciate that the plot was moved forward with the public shipping MinLee, instead of them hating on Sori.  \n\n- **Minor Characters:**  \n   - I was not really a fan of Hyemi.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, even though this book could have some flaws to other people, I can look past those and call this a personal favorite.

Dans cette quête de soi, Nathaniel devient une figure incontournable. J'ai particulièrement apprécié que l'histoire évite les rebondissements prévisibles et les drames excessifs. Contrairement à mes attentes, l'autrice choisit d'explorer des chemins inattendus, ce dont je suis reconnaissante. De plus, n'étant pas une grande fan de Kpop, j'ai aimé que l'intrigue s'ouvre à d'autres horizons, offrant des événements variés. J'ai tout particulièrement adoré la dynamique de l'émission de télé et l'humour qui en ressort.",
            "J'ai adoré retrouver Sori, que je trouve encore plus attachante que Jenny, l'héroïne précédente. J'ai davantage de points communs avec elle, ce qui la rend d'autant plus touchante. Mon seul regret est de ne pas avoir vu plus de personnages du premier tome et leur évolution.",

Ce n'est peut-être pas un chef-d'œuvre, mais c'est un délicieux bonbon acidulé. Étant donné que je ne lis pas souvent des romans de ce genre, je n'ai pas eu le temps de m'en lasser."

Her journey of stepping away from her idol status to explore her true passions and desires was compelling and relatable. The complexity of her relationships with her family enriched her character, illuminating her motivations and decisions. The emotional healing between Sori and her mother was especially impactful, highlighted by the poignant line: “I would walk the same path every lifetime, if I knew that at the end of it, you were waiting for me.” Youngmin and Sun delivered standout performances that added depth to the narrative. I appreciated the support from the book club for Manager Min Sori, although Creative Director Min Sori felt like a more fitting choice for her journey."

            "The radio and variety show arcs were a delightful addition that I thoroughly enjoyed, especially as a fan of variety shows. This element was notably absent in the first novel. The complexities of Sori and Nathaniel's careers provided a realistic challenge for their relationship, adding depth to the overall narrative.",
            "I absolutely adore the complex relationship between Sori and Nathaniel. The way Sori reconciles with her mother, despite her mother's demanding job, is truly heartwarming. Sori remains a steadfast supporter of her mom and her work ethic. I also appreciated the absence of any rich girl attitude or bitterness in the dynamic between Sori and Hyemi. Sori wholeheartedly supports Hyemi in her pursuit of success. The XOXO boys create a welcoming, accepting environment, especially for Hyemi as she joins their circle. Sori's affection for her stuffed animals adds a delightful charm to her character. I found Jenny's portrayal intriguing, particularly with the shifts in point of view, and I appreciated that she wasn't overly dominant in the story. Additionally, I enjoyed getting to know Sun better; his relationship with his grandfather and his amusing habit of pawned-off arranged dates make him a captivating character.",

Sori is an avid supporter of Hyemi, who is determined to be successful.  \n   - The XOXO boys are portrayed as a big, accepting family, especially with how they welcome Hyemi into their circle.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - Sori and her stuffed animals were too cute, adding a charming layer to her character.  \n   - I was intrigued by how Jenny was portrayed with the change in POVs. I liked that she wasn’t overly prominent in the story.  \n   - I enjoyed learning more about Sun, who wasn’t featured much in the first novel. His relationship with his grandfather and his habit of pawned-off arranged dates make him a fascinating character.  \n\n- **Plot and Story Arcs:**  \n   - The radio/variety show arcs were so fun! As a fan of variety shows, I loved this addition, which wasn’t present in the first novel.  \n   - The careers of Sori and Nathaniel made their relationship tricky, which felt realistic and added depth to the story.  \n\n- **Visual and Aesthetic Appeal:**  \n   - The cover perfectly matched how I pictured Sori and Nathaniel, which was a delightful touch.  \n\n- **Future Expectations:**  \n   - I demand a story for Sun! He seems like a cool, down-to-earth guy who deserves his own story and a chance to find \"the one.\" I’m curious about his relationship with his grandfather and his romantic prospects (did anyone else think he and Hyemi might have a moment?).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel was a delightful read, filled with complex relationships, charming characters, and engaging story arcs. The author did an excellent job of expanding on Sori and Nathaniel’s relationship while introducing new dynamics, like the variety show arcs and the exploration of Sun’s character. I’m eagerly hoping for a future story centered around Sun!  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

She has a unique ability to make clichés flourish beautifully, which adds a special charm to her storytelling.\n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  This book has so many elements I adore: exes to lovers, childhood friends to lovers, wealthy conglomerate families, scandals, and more. The story is rich with drama and emotional depth, reminiscent of a K-drama. The second half of the book had me bawling and screaming due to the intense emotional rollercoaster. The realistic portrayal of Sori's struggles—like dealing with Hyemi's scandal, her forced relationship with a CEO's nephew, and her mother's stress—made the story deeply relatable and heart-wrenching.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I was thrilled that Sori got her own book and a resolution with Nathaniel after their unresolved thread in *XOXO*. Nathaniel's unwavering support for Sori, even after their fallout, was both painful and beautiful to witness. His decision to pull away after learning her sacrifices for her mother added layers of complexity to their relationship.\n\n- **Cultural Elements:**  \n  My previous experience with Korean manhwa helped me understand certain cultural references and words in the book, which enhanced my reading experience.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The angst and emotional turmoil in the story were so intense that I wish I could erase my memory and relive the experience all over again. The cover art of Sori and Nathaniel is also stunning and adds to the overall appeal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a must-read for fans of K-dramas and angsty romance. Axie Oh's writing, combined with the emotional depth and relatable struggles of the characters, makes for an unforgettable reading experience.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n★★★★★ (5/5)"

            "I appreciated that Sori finally received her story, which is filled with hard work, struggle, and guilt. She grapples with the desire to follow her own path while trying to please her parents. Throughout *XOXO*, she proves her excellence in everything she takes on, ultimately realizing that choosing her own path is the key to opening new opportunities. Sori is a strong protagonist; although initially friendless except for Jaewoo, she quickly bonds with others once she lowers her defenses. Her family life is complicated, with a father embroiled in affairs and a mother who feels trapped, unable to divorce without risking her control of the Joah label, which oversees both *XOXO* and *ASAP*. The threat of scandal looms, particularly regarding her relationship with Nathaniel. Despite these challenges, I adore the connection between Sori and Jenny, demonstrating that long-distance friendships can endure.",

The story gave me hope for future generations, showcasing resilience and growth in its characters. After reading several disappointing books recently, this one stood out as a touching and beautifully crafted narrative that resonated deeply with me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis was a wonderful, heartwarming story that left a lasting impact. The characters, writing, and emotional depth made it a standout read, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a meaningful and entertaining novel.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n- Writing: 5/5  \n- Characters: 5/5  \n- Plot: 4/5  \n- Entertainment Value: 5/5  \n- Re-readability: Maybe  \n- Narration: 5/5  \n- Cover Art: 5/5"

Her journey of self-discovery, particularly through mentoring the new idol group ASAP, was inspiring and relatable.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The plot revolves around Sori helping ASAP debut, which creates plenty of opportunities for her to reconnect with Nathaniel. This setup not only drives the romance but also allows Sori to explore her passions and redefine her goals.

            "**Sori:** She’s an exceptional female protagonist. I loved her initially cold demeanor, which revealed significant depth as the story unfolded. Her character development was well-executed, and I thoroughly enjoyed her perspective. **Nathaniel:** Having been intrigued by him since *XOXO* (I might even prefer him over Jaewoo!), he certainly lived up to my expectations in this book. He’s not only attractive but also sweet and caring, truly driving the story forward. **Jenny and Jaewoo:** Their appearances added a wholesome touch, and I’m happy to see them content together. The romance between Sori and Nathaniel was adorable, and the second-chance trope was effectively utilized, showcasing many memorable scenes. Their chemistry was palpable; however, I did find Sori’s tendency to push Nathaniel away frustrating, especially when their mutual feelings were so clear. The drawn-out third-act conflict became tedious and detracted from the overall experience.",
            "This delightful K-pop romance, featuring a second chance set in Korea, follows two famous characters. I thoroughly enjoyed *XOXO*, where Sori and Nathaniel were my favorite side characters, so I was excited to see them get their own story. This sequel is an excellent follow-up and a pleasure to read. I really appreciate the author’s writing style; this is only my second book of hers, but her simple yet vivid prose perfectly complements these charming romances. The immersive narrative kept me hooked—I couldn't put it down! The K-pop industry provided an interesting backdrop, and while the romance took center stage, there was enough surrounding plot to maintain my interest."

This was the perfect follow-up to *XOXO* and was so much fun to read.\n\n- **Writing & Plot:**  \n  - I really like Axie Oh’s writing style.

It made the story feel immersive and bingeable—I couldn’t put it down once I started.  \n  - The storyline was enjoyable, with the Kpop industry as a fascinating backdrop.

            "The romance in *ASAP* is irresistibly swoon-worthy, a signature of the author’s craft. The intense chemistry between Nathaniel and Sori kept me captivated, and their second-chance love story is both engaging and heartwarming. I enjoyed their dynamic almost as much as I did Jenny and Jaewoo’s relationship. While *XOXO* featured star-crossed lovers, *ASAP* had me on the edge of my seat, eagerly hoping Nathaniel and Sori would reunite. \n\nFocused on the two characters introduced in *XOXO*, *ASAP* delves into their more complex relationship as exes with unresolved feelings. When a scandal strikes Nathaniel, Sori steps in to support him, reigniting feelings she believed were long buried. Sori's journey is particularly compelling; despite having a well-planned future as an idol, she begins to question her path and discovers her true desires. This internal conflict adds significant depth to her character.",
            "The author's writing remains enchanting, featuring endearing characters and an irresistibly engaging story. The setting in Seoul adds a unique charm to the narrative. My only critique is that the ending felt rushed, reminiscent of *XOXO*. While this wasn't an issue in *The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea*, I would have preferred more development in the conclusion. Nevertheless, I wasn't dissatisfied—just left wanting more.",
            "This book holds great personal significance for me. I read *XOXO* during one of the happiest times in my life, and the joy I felt then is forever linked to it. When *ASAP* was announced, I was thrilled, and reading it felt like a beautiful trip down memory lane. It's truly a gem, and I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to read it early. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone—it's absolutely worth your time."

        "conclusion": "*ASAP* is a beautiful, heartfelt second-chance romance that captures the magic of the author’s storytelling. While the ending felt slightly rushed, the book’s charm, chemistry, and emotional depth make it a must-read. It’s a story that will leave you yearning for more and reaffirms why this author is one of my favorites.",

Although she grew up wealthy, her lack of deep family connections shaped her character, making her seem cold and aloof at times, despite her heart of gold. Her love for stuffed animals and her quirky belief in leaving their bags open for them to breathe were particularly endearing. Nathaniel, on the other hand, boasts a supportive family, devoted bandmates, and a burgeoning career with XOXO. He is honest, sweet, and perhaps a bit too perfect, but his charm is hard to resist. The warm moments he shares with his sisters add depth to his character, and I appreciated the second-chance romance aspect.

            "Overall, I enjoyed this story. It offers a relaxed glimpse into idol life, making it an easy read. While it unfolds slowly, there's a touch of sweetness towards the end. If you're a K-pop fan, I highly recommend it—it's like getting a behind-the-scenes view of the industry. The focus is primarily on the lives of the idols, while the romance plays out as a second-chance love story filled with lingering tension. The main characters clearly still love each other, yet a constant push-and-pull dynamic keeps them apart until the conclusion.",
            "Nathaniel and Sori are an adorable couple who truly understand each other without the need for many words. Their bond shines through in simple, everyday moments—like Nathaniel waiting for Sori at the mart so they can walk home together or sharing breakfast. These ordinary experiences are sweet and heartwarming, showcasing the depth of their connection.",
            "Set in South Korea, the story follows a male idol and the daughter of an entertainment CEO, who is also a trainee. K-pop fans will likely find this book enjoyable (raising my hand!) as it vividly captures the industry's essence. From idol training and variety shows (you'll recognize the references) to radio shows, drama filming, and award ceremonies, it encompasses the entire K-pop experience in one engaging read.",

I ended up enjoying it a lot, even though it’s a slow burn, which isn’t usually my preference. The main reason I liked it is probably because of the fangirl aspect, haha.  \n\n- **Setting and Theme:**  \n  The story is set in South Korea and revolves around a male idol and the daughter of a CEO of an entertainment company, who is also a trainee. If you’re a K-pop fan, you’ll likely enjoy this book (raising my hand 🙋🏻‍♀️) because it’s easy to visualize everything while reading. The book covers idol training, variety shows (you can tell which show it’s referencing 🤭), radio shows, drama filming, and award ceremonies—it’s all there in one book, haha.  \n\n- **Plot and Character Dynamics:**  \n  Most of the story focuses on the life of idols. The romance part, being a second-chance love story, has a lingering tension between the two main characters. They both know they still love each other, but due to various reasons, there’s a constant push-and-pull dynamic until the end, haha.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  Nathaniel and Sori are so adorable! They’re a couple who understand each other without needing to say much. Just being by each other’s side is enough for them. They don’t do anything overly romantic; it’s mostly simple, everyday things like the male lead waiting for the female lead at the mart every day to walk home together or having breakfast together. These ordinary moments are so sweet and heartwarming. 🥰  \n\n- **Pacing and Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Overall, I liked it. It’s a chill read where you can just follow along with the idol life, haha. It’s a real slow burn, with only a bit of sweetness towards the end. If you’re a K-pop fan, I’d recommend it—it feels like you’re getting a behind-the-scenes look at idol life. 💖  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis YA novel, set in the K-pop world, is a slow-burn romance with a focus on the everyday lives of idols. While the pacing is slow, the relatable and heartwarming moments between the characters make it an enjoyable read, especially for K-pop fans.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n★★★★☆ (4/5 stars)"

Sori’s awareness of idol culture added a layer of realism to the story.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - If you’re looking for a plot-heavy novel, you might be disappointed. The focus of *ASAP* is on Sori’s personal growth and her relationships, which I found engaging and well-executed.\n   - The only critique I have is the lack of resolution regarding Nathaniel and Sori going public with their relationship.

            "The title *ASAP* led me to believe that Sori might join the idol group, either to support her mother or to step in for Hyemi. I found myself hoping she'd become an idol, especially after her charming performances on the variety show. While the miscommunication between Sori and Nathaniel was at times frustrating, it kept me engaged. For instance, Sori's decision not to share her secret date with the rival CEO’s nephew was both heartbreaking and infuriating. The variety show moments, like Nathaniel choosing Sori and his surprise appearance at Noraebang to sing Taeyang’s “EYES, NOSE, LIPS,” added delightful nostalgia to the story.",
            "I found Nathaniel and Sori's relationship in *XOXO* more enjoyable than Jaewoo and Jenny's. Their sweet and engaging dynamic was a highlight for me. Nathaniel's sisters added a lovely touch, and I appreciated their interactions with Sori. From the start, I found it hard to trust Hyemi, especially when it became apparent she had a crush on Nathaniel. Her actions, like revealing Sori's secrets, only reinforced my suspicions. Sun’s protective words towards Sori, particularly when he said, “Jenny was a stranger to me; you're not. I'll always be on your side,” were truly heartwarming. Sori's struggles with her mother's expectations struck a chord with me, as I too am close to my mom. I wish Sori's mom had been more understanding during her younger years. Ultimately, Sori's determination to pursue her own path despite external pressures was empowering.",
            "I appreciated that Sun's drama is an adaptation of *The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea*, creating a clever Easter egg that pays homage to the author's other work. The references to older K-pop groups and 2nd generation fangirl culture were a delightful touch, resonating with me as a fellow 2nd gen fan.",
            "Refined Review:  \nThis story evoked a powerful emotional response, particularly in the scene where Sori informs Nathaniel that she won't attend his song premiere—my heart sank, a true testament to the narrative's strength. The confession and reconciliation in the ladies' room were both intense and gratifying.\n\n**Favorite Quotes:**  \n"
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *ASAP* was an enjoyable, low-stakes read with relatable characters, engaging dynamics, and nostalgic K-pop references. While the miscommunication trope was frustrating at times, it added depth to the story. Sori’s journey of self-discovery and staying true to herself was empowering, and the Easter eggs for fans of the author were a delightful touch.",

Their dynamic was sweet and engaging.  \n   - Nathaniel's sisters were lovely, and I appreciated their interactions with Sori.  \n   - I didn’t trust Hyemi from the start, especially when it seemed like she had a crush on Nathaniel. Her actions, like ratting Sori out, confirmed my suspicions.  \n   - Sun’s protective stance toward Sori, especially when he said, “Jenny was a stranger to me, you're not. I'll always be on your side,” was heartwarming.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relatability:**  \n   - Sori’s struggle with her mom and the pressure to not disappoint her was very relatable. As someone close to my mom, I understood her dilemma.  \n   - I wished Sori’s mom had been more understanding during her younger years.  \n   - Sori’s decision to stick to her guns and pursue what she wanted, despite external pressures, was empowering.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n   - The title *ASAP* made me think Sori might still end up in the idol group, either to help her mom or replace Hyemi. I even wanted her to become an idol after her cute variety/radio show performances.  \n   - The miscommunication trope between Sori and Nathaniel was frustrating but also engaging. For example, when Sori didn’t tell Nathaniel about her secret date with the rival CEO’s nephew, it was both heartbreaking and infuriating.  \n   - The variety show moments, like Nathaniel picking Sori and showing up at Noraebang to sing Taeyang’s “EYES, NOSE, LIPS,” were delightful and nostalgic.  \n\n- **World-Building and Easter Eggs:**  \n   - I loved that Sun’s drama was an adaptation of *The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea*, another book by Axie Oh. It was a clever Easter egg and a nice nod to her other work.  \n   - The throwbacks to older K-pop groups and 2nd generation fangirl culture were a treat, especially as a fellow 2nd gen fangirl.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n   - The story really got me in my feels, especially during the scene where Sori told Nathaniel she wouldn’t attend his song premiere. My heart was crushed, which is a sign of a good story.  \n   - The confession and make-up scene in the ladies’ room was both intense and satisfying.  \n\n**Favorite Quotes:**  \n- “Thanks by the way, for picking up my call.” - Sori  \n- “I'll always pick up your calls.” - Nathaniel  \n- “Never wear something like that again.” - Nathaniel (when Sori passed out in the water)  \n- “Jenny was a stranger to me, you're not. I'll always be on your side.” - Sun  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *ASAP* was an enjoyable, low-stakes read with relatable characters, engaging dynamics, and nostalgic K-pop references. While the miscommunication trope was frustrating at times, it added depth to the story. Sori’s journey of self-discovery and staying true to herself was empowering, and the Easter eggs for Axie Oh fans were a delightful touch.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This companion book to *XOXO* centers on Sori, an idol trainee reluctant to debut. As she navigates her feelings for Nathaniel, a strained relationship with her mother, and her role in mentoring a new trainee, Sori grapples with multiple conflicts: her personal desires, her mother's expectations, lingering affections for Nathaniel, and her mother's company’s financial struggles. While some resolutions feel a bit too neat, I appreciated the focus on Sori’s happiness throughout the story.",
            "Sori is a fully realized and captivating character, embodying a striking contrast between her cool, aloof exterior and her soft, stuffed animal-loving nature. She wrestles with internal conflicts, such as drifting away from her friend Jenny, navigating parental pressures, and grappling with her reluctance to pursue an idol debut, fearing disappointment for her mother. Her journey of balancing others' expectations with her own desires, particularly in expressing her feelings for Nathaniel, serves as a central theme. Sori's character arc, transitioning from loneliness to love and friendship, is deeply engaging.\n\nWhile Nathaniel has a neutral presence—neither strongly likable nor unlikable—he shares a believable chemistry with Sori through his care and understanding. However, his jokey and flirty personality doesn't make a significant impact, and I find myself rooting for him mainly because of Sori's feelings rather than his own depth. The romance is central to the narrative, featuring a second-chance trope that I typically dislike, but I can overlook it due to Sori's charm. Though their chemistry feels authentic, it lacks a deeper resonance.",
            "This delightful coming-of-age story centers around a central romance. While it carries a slightly cheesy tone, it ultimately captivates with its charm and heartwarming moments.",
            "The reader's newfound appreciation for K-pop enriched their enjoyment of the book, allowing for a deeper understanding of the cultural references, such as fan culture, variety shows, and promotions. The variety show scene, in particular, was particularly enjoyable to envision."
        ],
        "conclusion": "This book is a charming and heartwarming coming-of-age story with a central romance. While the romance is important, the real draw is Sori’s character arc and her journey toward self-discovery and happiness. Nathaniel is a neutral character, but his chemistry with Sori is believable enough to root for their relationship. The K-pop setting adds an enjoyable layer for fans of the genre, and despite some overly tidy resolutions, the book’s focus on Sori’s happiness makes it a satisfying read.",

In contrast, Nathaniel appears to be adrift in his emotions.",

The description was so intriguing, and I knew the book would be light-hearted, given the age rating.\n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**\n   - The plot, in my opinion, was very well-structured. Nothing happened too quickly, and I really liked the pace at which the main characters' relationship rekindled.\n\n- **Themes and Relationship Dynamics:**\n   - The story features a slightly forbidden romance, mainly because Nathaniel is a star and an idol for the fans of the band he’s in. Sori, the main character, was also supposed to become an idol in a band called Asap, at her mother’s urging. Every encounter between the main characters felt natural.\n\n- **Character Development:**\n   - I love young adult novels, and this one will definitely be one of my favorites. Sori is a character I liked from the very beginning. She’s radiant but also hides pain. She puts her family, specifically her mother, above herself, making her an incredible character. Nathaniel, on the other hand, seemed lost in his feelings.\n\n- **Personal Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - I know I’ll revisit this book someday and will also read other works by this author. If you enjoy young adult novels, I highly recommend giving this one a try and sharing your thoughts!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis review highlights the reader’s strong appreciation for the book’s well-paced plot, relatable characters, and engaging themes.

Sori's choice to step back from idol aspirations and instead train the ASAP group enriches her character and adds depth to the narrative. This dual focus on romance alongside Sori's personal and professional challenges results in a well-rounded and engaging story.",
            "The story unfolds entirely through Sori's first-person perspective, effectively showcasing her as a strong, morally grounded character with relatable flaws like jealousy. While Nathaniel remains enigmatic due to the lack of his viewpoints, his captivating interactions with Sori anchor the emotional core of the narrative.

I also appreciated the cameos from characters in previous books, particularly the adorable pairing of Jenny and Jaewoo. The romance between Sori and Nathaniel was a poignant rollercoaster of emotions; Sori's indecision and fear of scandal created palpable tension, but Nathaniel remained a constant, loving presence throughout.

            "In *ASAP*, the pacing is an improvement over *XOXO*, particularly in how it sets up resolutions in the final chapters. However, it still struggles: the conflict between Sori and Nathaniel lingers too long in the last third, and Hyemi’s broken arm subplot seems superfluous. Additionally, the first third of the book lacks structure, giving it a slow and aimless feel as Sori is repeatedly moved between locations with minimal context.",
            "Crafting a relatable wealthy protagonist is no easy feat, but Sori successfully navigates this challenge, avoiding the pitfalls of being unrelatable or obnoxious. Her conflicts are deeply rooted in her family and responsibilities, especially her complex relationship with her mother. Sori recognizes her privileges and candidly addresses the darker sides of her world. Ultimately, her motivations are selfless, driven by a desire to protect her mother and support Hyemi.",
            "The story lacks the organic structure found in *XOXO*, as Sori's actions are often dictated by her parents' secretaries or her company, resulting in a disjointed and abrupt narrative."

Sori’s character is well-developed and relatable, and her relationship with Nathaniel is a highlight. However, the book’s lack of a clear structure in the beginning and some unresolved subplots detract from the overall experience.",

Sori reluctantly agrees to train the new girl, Heri, for the upcoming debut group, which means she’ll frequently encounter Nathaniel at joint reality shows and events.

The chemistry between them is undeniable, and fans adore their relationship.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Character Development and Familiarity:**  \n   - I already knew the characters from *XOXO*, so reading the book felt like reuniting with old friends.  \n   - Sori and Nathaniel are an ex-couple, but it’s obvious they are not over each other.  \n\n- **Plot and Conflict:**  \n   - Sori decides she doesn’t want to be an idol, but her mother challenges her to prove she’s responsible enough to make such a big decision.  \n   - Sori agrees to train the new girl, Heri, for the debut group, but this means she’ll have to see Nathaniel frequently due to shared appearances on reality shows and events.  \n   - The drama Sori and her family created got a bit frustrating as the book progressed, especially with Sori’s exaggerated reasons for staying away from Nathaniel, which led to a brief breakup.  \n\n- **Romantic Chemistry and Fan Service:**  \n   - I loved the publicity stunts Sori and Nathaniel were asked to do, like playing games on shows, making guest appearances, and even kissing for a TV show scene.  \n   - The fans loved them as a couple, and I have to agree—their chemistry was crazy.  \n\n- **Subplots and Minor Characters:**  \n   - There was a small detail where Heri fell in love with Nathaniel, but thankfully she decided not to pursue it, which spared me from additional drama.  \n\n- **Personal Connection and Enjoyment:**  \n   - I think I enjoyed this more than *XOXO*.  \n   - I’m proud of myself for knowing every K-pop song mentioned in the karaoke scene—my sister made a decent K-pop fan out of me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was an enjoyable read, especially for fans of *XOXO* who are already familiar with the characters. The chemistry between Sori and Nathaniel was a highlight, though the family-driven drama and Sori’s exaggerated decisions occasionally became frustrating. The inclusion of K-pop culture and fan service moments added to the fun, making it a satisfying follow-up.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No explicit rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The story follows Sori, the daughter of estranged parents, who faces pressure from her mother, a CEO of an entertainment company, to pursue a career as a K-pop idol, despite her uncertainties about this path. Central to the plot is her romance with Nathaniel, a Korean American K-pop idol, as they navigate their rekindled relationship after being forced apart in their teens due to industry constraints. The narrative explores themes of self-discovery, familial dynamics, and second-chance romance.",

Nathaniel is a well-rounded character, and their shared history deepens their rekindled romance. The inclusion of side characters, such as Sori’s best friend from the author’s previous novel, *ASAP*, further enriches the story.",
            "This story features engaging writing that captivates readers and draws them into the characters' journeys. The pacing is well-suited for a young adult novel; however, I personally would have favored a second-chance romance set 5-10 years later for a more mature tone.",

Her attachment to her teddies adds a heartwarming touch. Nathanial emerges as a caring and appealing partner, and I enjoyed delving deeper into his character. The romance between Sori and Nathanial is engaging, particularly during moments of jealousy. However, some of the romantic scenes come off as cringey, cliché, and unrealistic, reminiscent of a low-quality K-drama. Sori's mixed signals and indecisiveness—such as pushing Nathanial away after their intimate moments—can be frustrating and contribute to a sense of inconsistency in their relationship."

You know I live to break them,\" was particularly memorable.  \n\n- **Characters:**  \n  - Sori was a fantastic female main character (FMC), and her character development was well-executed.  \n  - Nathaniel was both attractive and caring, making him a standout love interest.  \n  - The supporting characters, like Jenny, Hyemi, and Sori's mom, added heartwarming dynamics to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Setting:**  \n  - The K-pop industry backdrop was engaging and fascinating.  \n  - The pool scene and other moments felt like watching a K-drama.  \n  - The reappearance of *XOXO* band members was a delightful touch, and I’m eager for a Youngmin & Hyemi spinoff.  \n\n- **Writing Style:**  \n  - Axie Oh’s writing is simple yet immersive, perfectly suited for cutesy romances.  \n  - The book was a fun, quick read that I devoured in one sitting.  \n\n- **Comparisons:**  \n  - This book was loads better than *XOXO*, and if you enjoyed *XOXO*, you’ll love this follow-up.  \n  - Sori and Nathaniel deserved their own book, and it did not disappoint.  \n\n- **Critiques:**  \n  - The prolonged third-act conflict was a bit annoying, though it didn’t detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a delightful, heartwarming read with a perfect blend of romance, K-pop, and engaging characters. It’s a must-read for K-pop-loving readers who enjoy cutesy, slow-burn romances.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n🌟🌟🌟🌟 (4/5 stars)"

            "The story's pacing is expertly balanced, allowing the relationship between Sori and Nathaniel to evolve naturally without sudden shifts or implausible resolutions. It opens with Sori in New York City, attending Fashion Week and reconnecting with a long-lost friend, Jenny, in a calm and enjoyable setting. However, the plot takes an unexpected turn when Jenny's boyfriend calls, inviting them to a nearby restaurant, where Sori unexpectedly runs into her ex-boyfriend Nathaniel, a member of a well-known K-pop group.",
            "Sori's character is marked by indecision, with her thoughts and desires shifting rapidly, often leading to contradictions influenced by her mother's opinions and career pressures. Nathaniel, her former lover, re-enters the story as someone whose breakup with Sori was linked to his K-pop debut and the ensuing public scrutiny. Their relationship develops slowly and authentically, steering clear of the cliché of instant forgiveness.",

            "The theme of second chances is central to the story. Although I usually don't favor this trope, it is skillfully executed here, allowing for a gradual and believable reconciliation between characters. Additionally, the narrative explores public perception, career pressures, and personal growth."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Despite some minor issues with Sori’s indecisiveness, the story was well-written, with a compelling plot and realistic character development. The theme of second chances was handled thoughtfully, and the author’s writing style made the book a pleasure to read. I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment and plan to catch up on the first book in the series. This story would make an excellent K-drama adaptation.",

In contrast, Nathaniel is open and supportive, readily sharing the emotional burden with Sori.

            "The story centers on Min Sori and Nathaniel Lee, who were beloved secondary characters from the previous book. It effectively recaps earlier events, making it enjoyable for newcomers, though it does spoil the earlier book's ending. However, the plot outside the romance appears messy and underdeveloped, with conflicts resolved too conveniently and quickly. Significant issues are often effortlessly tackled by Sori, her mother, or Nathaniel, weakening the plot in contrast to the strong character relationships.",
            "Min Sori's character is richly developed, offering insights into her aloofness, chaebol upbringing, and the complexities of her familial relationships. The dynamic between Sori and Nathaniel stands out as the novel's highlight, marked by lively banter, palpable tension, tender moments, and a slow-burn rekindling of their romance. The second-chance love trope is masterfully executed, showcasing the characters as they rediscover their friendship and fall in love once more.",
            "Set in the K-pop idol industry, this story offers a more immersive experience than XOXO, as both protagonists have direct ties to the scene. The portrayal of the K-pop and Korean media landscape is realistic and well-crafted, highlighting the pressures and expectations faced by idols. For readers familiar with K-pop and K-dramas, this book resonates deeply with Korean pop culture, making it less beginner-friendly than XOXO. The occasional K-drama-inspired moments between Sori and Nathaniel further enhance its cultural authenticity."

While the plot outside the romance feels weak and underdeveloped, the novel excels in its portrayal of relationships and the K-pop industry. It’s a must-read for fans of K-dramas and K-pop, though it may be less accessible to those unfamiliar with Korean pop culture.",

It was refreshing to return to Nathaniel and Sori as the main characters. I appreciated Sori's journey of self-discovery as she decides against pursuing a career as a K-pop singer and seeks balance in her relationships—both her platonic friendship with Jenny and her romantic connection with Nathaniel. While I'm usually not a fan of second-chance romances, this one worked for me, perhaps because they maintained a friendship after their breakup.

Their interactions, especially during the K-drama cameo and the batting cage scene, had me blushing so hard!  \n- **Exploration of the K-pop Industry:** I loved how this book delved into aspects of the K-pop industry not covered in the first book, such as idols appearing on reality TV shows, podcasts, and award shows.  \n- **Continuity and Cameos:** I was thrilled to see all the members of XOXO and Jenny make appearances. It added a sense of continuity and made the story even more enjoyable.  \n- **Desire for More Stories:** I wish there were even more books in this series. I would love to see every single member of XOXO get their own story and find out what happens with ASAP.  \n- **Author Appreciation:** I’m so happy I discovered Axie Oh. All the books I’ve read by her are amazing, and the cover designs are so pretty. I can’t wait to read more of her work!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was an absolute delight! The chemistry between the characters, the deeper dive into the K-pop industry, and the cameos from familiar faces made it impossible to put down.

It was so cute and fluffy—I swear! It made for a good light binge read, perfect for procrastination.  \n\n- **Plot and Predictability:**  \n  The plot was quite predictable, and the twists weren’t dramatic enough to leave a lasting impact. However, it was still enjoyable for what it was.  \n\n- **Characterization (Main Character):**  \n  Sori, the female lead, was a breath of fresh air. She was relatable and a go-getter without being overly aggressive or coming across as a \"pick me\" type, which is rare in many stories. I’ve always complained about strong female characters being written poorly, but Sori was well-crafted and likable.  \n\n- **Characterization (Supporting Characters):**  \n  Even the love \"rivals\" (though they weren’t very rival-like) were well-written. They weren’t villainized and had good characterization, which added depth to the story.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a light, fluffy, and enjoyable read, perfect for when you need a break or want to procrastinate. While the plot is predictable and lacks dramatic twists, the well-crafted characters, especially Sori, make it worth the read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It was toned down on the cringe factor and was an all-around fine time. The story was very engrossing, especially with its deep dive into K-pop culture, which I found enjoyable to a certain extent.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I loved Sori and Nathaniel’s personalities so much. Sori was a very fun lead to read about, and her struggles with various issues made her character interesting. Nathaniel, on the other hand, was just a vibe—his presence added a lot to the story.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  I would have loved a lot more scenes with Sori and her mother, as their relationship felt underexplored. Additionally, I thought the ending felt a bit rushed and a little too convenient, which took away from the overall experience.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a fun and engaging read with enjoyable characters and a unique focus on K-pop culture. While the ending felt rushed and some relationships could have been explored further, it was still a delightful experience.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

A book centered around Gi Taek and Angela would also be perfect. While I liked Sori and Nathaniel more than Jennie and Jaewoo, I still find all the characters incredibly engaging and enjoyable.  \n- **Tone and Genre:**  \n  These books strike a great balance between dealing with serious topics and maintaining a lighthearted, over-the-top romcom vibe. I appreciate how they manage to be both meaningful and fun, which is exactly what I look for in this genre.  \n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would eagerly buy more books by Axie Oh. The series has a charm that keeps me coming back for more, and I’m fully invested in the world and characters she’s created.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn summary, this novel is a delightful blend of humor, romance, and heartfelt moments. While I have my favorite characters, the entire cast is endearing, and the tone of the story is exactly what I enjoy. I’m excited for more books in this series and would happily read anything Axie Oh writes next.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The palpable sexual tension between them kept me eager for a passionate moment, and their romance surpassed even that of Jenny and Jaewoo—something I thought was impossible.

However, most of the major plot points happened towards the end, making the earlier parts of the book feel slower and less engaging.  \n\n- **Character Development (Sori):**  \n  Sori’s decisions felt inconsistent—she repeatedly tells Nathaniel they can’t be together but then rushes to see him, only to push him away again.

Everything came together almost too perfectly and too quickly, with Sori breaking things off with the rival CEO’s nephew, standing up to her father, reuniting with her mother, and getting Nathaniel back all within a matter of chapters.  \n\n- **Subplots and Drama:**  \n  The resolution of subplots, such as the scandal about Hyemi (which blows over) and Sori’s mom asking for a divorce, felt rushed and overly convenient. The drama tied up neatly, like a present with a bow on top, but it lacked depth and believability.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, I give this book more credit because I like Sori and Nathaniel as characters.

            "The storyline lacks excitement, centering around Sori, who returns home and decides against pursuing an idol career, yet remains uncertain about her future. Her mother initially intended for Sori to join a new girl group but instead selects Hyemi, an inexperienced candidate, leading Sori to spend two weeks preparing her. Complicating matters, Sori has long harbored feelings for Nathaniel, but two years ago, she ended their relationship to comply with her mother's wishes. Now, with the two frequently appearing together at media events, observers begin to notice their undeniable chemistry. The narrative is filled with absurd situations, such as radio shows, reality TV antics, an awards ceremony, and even stalking Nathaniel at a batting cage, all while Sori is pressured to date a man her father approves of. The pacing feels uneven, especially with hasty shifts in Sori and Nathaniel's relationship. Overall, the scenes come across as unrealistic, exemplified when Sori tracks Nathaniel down just to address a rumor about their potential romance.",
            "I found it hard to connect with the main character, Sori. She came across as boring, hypocritical, immature, and overly needy. In the first book, she was unapologetically flawed and admitted her mistakes, but that version of her was missing here. Sori and Nathaniel's relationship felt inconsistent and lacked depth, shifting from passionate kisses to implied intimacy without any discussion about protection. Additionally, Hyemi’s sudden declaration of love for Nathaniel felt like unnecessary drama. Sori's strained relationship with her parents added to the overall discontent; her mother is rarely home, and her father has distanced himself because Sori refuses to obey him blindly.",
            "The book misses the opportunity to highlight crucial themes, particularly the ramifications of unprotected sex, which is especially relevant considering Sori's mother's history. Additionally, Sori's immaturity, illustrated by her bed filled with stuffed animals, and her irrational actions undermine the story's potential impact."

        "conclusion": "I did not enjoy this book. The main character, Sori, was unlikable and inconsistent with her portrayal in the previous book. The storyline was boring and filled with ridiculous, irrational scenes. The relationship between Sori and Nathaniel lacked depth and was poorly developed. Overall, the book failed to deliver a compelling narrative or meaningful themes. If there's another book in the series, I won't be reading it.",

Sori spends two weeks helping Hyemi get ready.\n   - Sori has always been in love with Nathaniel, but for reasons, they couldn't be together. Two years ago, Sori obeyed her mother's wishes and broke up with him.\n   - Fast forward to now, Sori and Nathaniel keep getting thrown together in media events, and people start to positively comment on their chemistry.\n   - There are ridiculous scenes, including radio shows, reality shows, extras in a drama, hosting an award show, stalking Nathaniel at a batting cage, and dating a guy her father wants her to date.\n\n- **Character Relationships:**\n   - Sori and Nathaniel's relationship is inconsistent and lacks depth. They go from scandalous kisses to implied sex without any discussion about protection.\n   - Hyemi decides she's in love with Nathaniel, adding unnecessary drama.\n   - Sori's relationship with her parents is strained. Her mother sleeps at the office, and her father has chosen not to be in her life since she won't blindly obey him.\n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**\n   - The pacing is off, with sudden jumps in the relationship between Sori and Nathaniel.\n   - The scenes are ridiculous and often irrational, such as when Sori tracks Nathaniel down to talk about a comment speculating they are together.\n\n- **Themes and Messages:**\n   - The book fails to emphasize important themes, such as the consequences of unprotected sex, especially given Sori's mother's history.\n   - The portrayal of Sori's immaturity (e.g., her bed covered with stuffed animals) and irrational behavior detracts from any meaningful messages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI did not enjoy this book. The main character, Sori, was unlikable and inconsistent with her portrayal in the previous book. The storyline was boring and filled with ridiculous, irrational scenes. The relationship between Sori and Nathaniel lacked depth and was poorly developed. Overall, the book failed to deliver a compelling narrative or meaningful themes. If there's another book in the series, I won't be reading it.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- Not explicitly mentioned in the review."

            "The pacing of the story was notably slow, and the plot felt disjointed, with little significant action occurring until approximately 87% of the way through. The narrative could have easily been condensed into a novella due to its excessive word count and lack of meaningful events. The romance, which was secondary to the plot, was underwhelming and lacked depth, featuring only a handful of kisses and cute moments. Overall, the romantic build-up felt disengaging and appeared to be treated as an afterthought.",
            "In this story, the female main character, Sori, comes across as uninteresting and overly dramatic, making her exhausting to follow. In contrast, Nathaniel shines as a sweet and enjoyable character. The narrative would have been more engaging if it had offered different perspectives or focused more on Nathaniel.",

            "The book centers on the mechanics of K-pop training, which may engage dedicated fans of the genre but could confuse those less familiar with it.

While the cover and premise hint at romance and excitement, the actual content falls short of these expectations."

            "Overall, I found the book to be somewhat disorganized. The plot felt minimal, comprised of scattered events that ultimately felt like an extended introduction. The resolution came too quickly for my liking, leaving me frustrated. While I didn’t want the characters to suffer unduly, I believed Sori needed to confront her fears more directly. I anticipated a heartfelt conversation with Jenny about their bond, or for Sori to openly express her true fears to the world. Although Sori did experience some character development, it felt overshadowed by the actions of secondary characters. This story is suitable for light reading but lacks depth.",
            "I’m not typically a fan of second chances, but I do enjoy friends-to-lovers stories. Nathaniel and Sori, therefore, presented a mixed experience for me. Ultimately, it was Sori’s character that kept me engaged and eager to continue reading.",
            "I may not be the target audience for this book, as I have little interest in K-pop and limited knowledge of the genre. The lack of explanations about its culture and mechanics left me feeling disconnected. While the author might have intended to avoid excessive emphasis on K-pop's intricacies, this choice ultimately detracted from my enjoyment. A bit more context would have enhanced the reading experience for me.",
            "I admired her decision to change her path without a clear future in sight, and the recognition that it takes courage to make such a choice resonated with me. A few years ago, I found myself in a similar situation—unsure of what I wanted but certain about what I didn't. This honest perspective was refreshing. However, I nearly put the book down out of boredom; while I didn't dislike it, I struggled to connect with the story or characters."

        "conclusion": "While the book had moments of relatability and refreshing takes on personal growth, it struggled with a lack of cohesive plot, rushed resolutions, and insufficient cultural context for readers unfamiliar with K-pop. The character dynamics were a mixed bag, and the story felt more like an introduction than a fully developed narrative. However, it serves as a light, easy read for those seeking something undemanding.",

It followed a frustrating cycle of Sori and Nathaniel flip-flopping between wanting to be together and pushing each other away, culminating in an abrupt and unconvincing resolution.  \n\n- **Writing and Pacing:**  \n   - The pacing felt off, especially in the romance plot, which dragged on with unnecessary back-and-forth. The writing didn’t effectively build tension or emotional investment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I don’t regret reading the book, I found it disappointing overall. The characters were weak, the romance plot was repetitive and unconvincing, and the story didn’t deliver on the fun, flirty YA romance I was hoping for. I wouldn’t recommend it to others.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book felt overly lengthy at over 340 pages, far exceeding what is needed for a second-chance romance. The pacing suffered due to an excess of drama and background details that could have been omitted.",
            "Sori was frustratingly passive, often waiting for things to happen instead of taking action. Nathaniel, despite being a main character, was barely present, which was disappointing. Sori's constant jealousy, glaring, and inability to communicate effectively made her character hard to engage with. Her perception of herself as a burden, along with her tendency to complain, grew repetitive and tiresome. The romance between Sori and Nathaniel felt unconvincing; although the author told us they were in love, it lacked emotional resonance, primarily due to excessive miscommunication that stunted their relationship development. The potential of the roommate trope to enhance their connection ultimately fell flat because of Sori's fussiness and lack of growth. Hyemi emerged as a standout character, and I wished Sori had been more direct with her to clear up mixed signals. Overall, Sori spent more time with her family and supporting characters like Sun and Jaewoo than with Nathaniel, creating an imbalance in a romance-focused narrative.",

The excessive length and repetitive conflicts made it a challenging read, though there were some redeeming elements, like Hyemi’s character.

This was initially nice but quickly turned into an annoying \"I’m-not-like-the-other-rich-girls\" trope.  \n   - The writing felt simplistic and uninspired, as if an amateur 12-year-old could have written something more interesting.  \n\n- **Inconsistencies and Unrealistic Elements:**  \n   - The portrayal of wealth and transportation in Korea felt inconsistent. While the main character took public transportation, everyone else had private drivers, which didn’t make sense.  \n\n- **Inspiration and Execution:**  \n   - The book felt like it was inspired by idol fanfiction and K-dramas but failed to capture any of their charm or quality.  \n\n- **Author’s Experience and Effort:**  \n   - I assumed this was the author’s first book, written by someone in their late teens, only to find out it’s her fifth book and she’s already graduated from university. This made me realize how poorly written and lacking in effort the book was.  \n\n- **Language and Grammar:**  \n   - I initially blamed the translation, thinking it was translated from Korean to English, but later discovered it was originally written in English, the author’s first language. The grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and poor cohesion were glaring, even to me as a non-native speaker.  \n\n- **Personal Dislikes:**  \n   - I hated the inclusion of a letter/postcard in the story, which felt outdated and unnecessary for a book set in this century.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book was a disappointment from start to finish.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  The book was plain and boring, to the point where I skipped through half of it. The pacing failed to hold my interest, making it difficult to stay engaged.  \n\n- **Character Development and Relationships:**  \n  There was no chemistry between the main characters, Sori and Nathaniel. Their interactions felt flat and unconvincing, which made it hard to care about their story. Additionally, there were a lot of useless characters who added little to no value to the narrative.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  I deeply regret reading this book. It was an unpleasant experience, and I found no redeeming qualities in it.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel was a disappointing read due to its lack of engagement, poor character development, and absence of meaningful relationships. It failed to capture my interest, and I would not recommend it.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n0/5"
