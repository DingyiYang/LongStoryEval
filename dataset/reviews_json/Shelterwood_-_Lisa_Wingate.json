            "The alternating chapters between 1909 and 1990 create a rich, intertwined narrative, though they can occasionally disrupt the story's flow. Despite this minor issue, the compelling themes of survival and resilience make the structure ultimately rewarding.",
            "This novel beautifully depicts the lives of two resilient women, Olive Augusta Radley (Ollie) and Valerie Boren-Odell, separated by nearly a century yet united by their courage and determination. Ollie flees an abusive stepfather to establish a sanctuary for neglected children, teaching them survival skills through hunting, fishing, and odd jobs. Meanwhile, Valerie, a widow and single mother, confronts male chauvinism as a Park Ranger while unraveling a series of mysterious events linked to Ollie’s past.",
            "The novel's evocative storytelling forges a deep connection between its characters, transcending time and leaving a lasting impact on the reader. The title, \"Shelterwood,\" beautifully symbolizes the nurturing and protective roles of the protagonists, akin to the shelterwood trees in a forest."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Shelterwood is a captivating novel that intertwines the lives of two courageous women across different eras, exploring themes of justice, survival, and resilience. While the alternating timeline structure can be slightly disruptive, the rich storytelling and emotional depth more than compensate for this flaw. The novel’s powerful conclusion and the profound connection between its characters make it a memorable and impactful read.",

            "The story unfolds across two timelines: in 1990, National Park Service officer Valerie navigates unsettling circumstances in her new role, while in 1909, eleven-year-old Ollie searches for her missing adopted Choctaw sister. Confronted with foul play, Ollie decides to flee with her younger sister. The alternating chapters skillfully build tension, consistently leaving readers on the edge of their seats.",
            "This book explores a lesser-known aspect of United States history, focusing on the people of Oklahoma during a tumultuous era. I appreciate the author’s research into this subject. While I was familiar with the Trail of Tears—its forced displacement and violence leading to land requisition—I was unaware of the land-owning Native Americans who were left behind and the fates of their families. The narrative is deeply troubling. Additionally, the book highlights the stories of women pioneers who advocated for abandoned children, shedding light on their struggles and sacrifices.",

It only took about half an hour more for me to get invested. The chapters alternate between two timelines, always leaving you on a cliffhanger, which kept me engaged.\n\n- **Narration and Performance:**  \n  The narration is great. Both Christine Larkin and Jenna Lamia do a wonderful job. I especially like Lamia’s interpretation of the children’s voices.\n\n- **Historical Context and Research:**  \n  This is a United States History subject that I was not familiar with. I am glad that Lisa Wingate chose to research this era and the people in Oklahoma who were involved. I learned about the Trail of Tears (forced displacement, murder) so that their land could be requisitioned (stolen), but I didn’t know about land-owning natives who were left behind and what became of them and their children. It is a sickening story. The book also brings to light stories about women pioneers who fought for the abandoned children and what was done to them.\n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The story is told in two timelines. In 1990, a National Park Service police officer, Valerie, begins her new job, which puts her in the middle of some disturbing circumstances. In 1909, eleven-year-old Ollie is worried about her missing adopted Choctaw sister, and due to foul play, she decides to flee with her younger sister. The chapters go back and forth between each timeline, always leaving you on a cliffhanger.\n\n- **Content Warnings and Themes:**  \n  If you can stomach the insinuation of child abuse (no graphic details) and want to know more about the abandoned native children during the land-grab, this is a great book.\n\n- **Author’s Insight and Additional Material:**  \n  At the end of the audiobook, the author shares how she got the idea to write the book and provides additional reading suggestions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book is a compelling and educational read, shedding light on a lesser-known part of U.S. history. Despite a slow start, the dual timelines and cliffhangers kept me engaged. The narration is excellent, and the historical context is both enlightening and heartbreaking. It’s a great choice for those interested in learning about the struggles of abandoned native children and the women who fought for them, though it does touch on sensitive themes like child abuse.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

It seems like an antique version of the Junior League or PEO, which adds an interesting historical layer to the narrative.  \n\n- **Engagement and Enjoyment:**  \n  The story was an excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it both compelling and thought-provoking.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a well-crafted piece of historical fiction that sheds light on a lesser-known and tragic part of American history. It is both educational and engaging, making it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

As Valerie strives to uncover the truth, she faces threats and obstacles, such as the removal of the bodies and the mysterious disappearance of a foster child. In the historical narrative, Olive and Nessa escape from Olive's abusive stepfather, encountering a mix of kindness and cruelty along their journey. They bond with other orphaned children to create a makeshift family in a place they call Shelterwood, but their safety is jeopardized when Olive's stepfather tracks them down.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Content and Themes:**  \n  The novel delves into heavy and difficult themes, including child abuse, murder, and the mistreatment of Choctaw children and their families. It is not a light read and may not be suitable for those who prefer a \"safe\" or escapist narrative. However, it is a compelling and thought-provoking story that sheds light on the harsh realities faced by marginalized groups in Oklahoma during the early 20th century.\n\n- **Characters:**  \n  The characters are richly developed and deeply engaging. Olive and Nessie, though not sisters, form a central part of the story. Olive's father brought Nessie and Hazel, two Choctaw girls, into their family, but after his death, their mother's addiction and their abusive stepfather left them vulnerable. The story also includes a National Park Ranger who provides an additional perspective on the events. The characters' voices, especially in the audio version, are exceptionally well-portrayed, bringing the story to life.\n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The story is told through dual timelines (1909 and 1990) and from multiple perspectives, including the children and the National Park Ranger. This structure adds depth and complexity to the narrative, allowing the reader to see both the immediate struggles of the children and the long-term impact of their experiences.\n\n- **Emotional Impact:**  \n  The novel is emotionally intense, blending elements of horror, courage, and survival. It is both a tribute to those who tried to protect the children and a stark portrayal of the injustices they faced. The journey of the characters, their struggles, and their resilience are deeply engaging and keep the reader invested throughout.\n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite its heavy subject matter, the novel is highly recommended for its powerful storytelling, compelling characters, and emotional depth. It is a story that stays with the reader long after finishing it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a gripping and emotionally charged tale that explores difficult themes with sensitivity and depth. Its compelling characters, dual timelines, and powerful narrative make it a standout read, though it may not be suitable for all audiences due to its heavy content.\n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nHighly recommended.

            "The novel skillfully employs a dual timeline, alternating between 1909 and 1990, enriching the narrative's depth and complexity. In 1909, we follow Olive Augusta Radley, a young girl who escapes her abusive stepfather alongside two Choctaw girls, navigating the wilderness and encountering other abandoned children. Meanwhile, the 1990 storyline features Valerie Boren-O’Dell, a park ranger investigating children's bones discovered in a cave and the mysterious disappearance of two teens in the Winding Stair Mountains. The interplay of these timelines creates a compelling and emotionally resonant story.",

Fast forward to 1990, Ranger Valerie Boren O'Dell starts a new chapter at Horsethief Trail National Park, only to find herself embroiled in a scandal involving a missing hiker, the discovery of human bones in a cave, and a narrative that shifts as Val interacts with the hiker's younger sister.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The novel alternates between 1909 and 1990 Oklahoma, following Ollie and Nessa as they escape an abusive home and park ranger Valerie, who investigates a missing persons case 80 years later in the state park that was once their home. The dual timelines effectively weave together the past and present, creating a compelling narrative structure.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Research:**  \n  The book delves into the history of the 1887 Dawes Act, which broke up tribal lands and allocated parcels to individual Native Americans. It highlights how the deaths of Native parents—some natural, some suspicious—led to children being assigned to caregivers, many of whom exploited the system to claim land allotments and amass wealth. This wealth was often used to gain political power, perpetuating systemic injustice. The author, Wingate, skillfully incorporates this historical backdrop into the story, making it both educational and emotionally impactful.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Themes:**  \n  The story is deeply emotional and heartbreaking, shedding light on the suffering of Indigenous children in early 1900s Oklahoma. Reading it evoked a sense of anxiety, as I hoped nothing terrible would happen to Ollie and Nessa, while also recognizing that similar tragedies occurred in real life and continue to this day. The themes of resilience, injustice, and the bravery of women who fought to protect these children are powerfully conveyed.  \n\n- **Comparisons and Recommendations:**  \n  Fans of *Killers of the Flower Moon* will find this book similarly compelling, though it offers a unique perspective through the eyes of children and the courageous women who supported them.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel is a poignant and well-researched exploration of a dark chapter in American history, told through the intertwined stories of Ollie, Nessa, and Valerie. It is both emotionally gripping and historically enlightening, making it a must-read for those interested in stories of resilience and justice.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

In *Shelterwood*, the theme of children in trouble resonated deeply with me, as did the inclusion of the Choctaw nation, which added an interesting aspect to the story.  \n\n- **Character Development and Emotional Engagement:**  \n  My heart was immediately drawn to Olive and Nessa in 1909. Olive's determination to save her little sister Nessa from their scum of a stepfather was both heartbreaking and inspiring. Similarly, in 1990, Valerie, a park ranger, mirrored Olive's loving and protective nature, creating a strong emotional connection.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The book is set in Oklahoma, a place I lived for a short period, which added a personal layer of connection. Ms. Wingate uses the history of the Choctaw nation to craft a story that both wrecks your heart and encourages your spirit. I loved the historical elements, which are typical of her work, and appreciated learning about aspects of history that should never be forgotten.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The dual timelines (1909 and 1990) were executed brilliantly and are, in my opinion, the best way to tell a story. I love learning while reading, which is why historical novels with dual timelines are some of my favorite reads.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Shelterwood* is a beautifully crafted novel that combines emotional depth, rich historical context, and compelling characters. Lisa Wingate's storytelling continues to captivate me, and this book is no exception. It is both heart-wrenching and uplifting, leaving a lasting impression.  \n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nI received a copy of this book from the publisher. I was not required to write a review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Despite warnings to leave it alone, she feels an irresistible urge to uncover its secrets. The connection between the two timelines is both poignant and reflective of the era.",

The mystery deepens with the disappearance of not only a 17-year-old boy but also his grandmother, Buggie, in the 1990 timeline. While I won’t spoil the ending, the resolution effectively connects the two timelines. The narrative alternates between Oklahoma in 1909 and 1990, with each chapter featuring distinct voices for the characters. In 1909, young Olive and her foster sister Nessa flee to escape sexual abuse at the hands of Olive’s stepfather. Meanwhile, in 1990, Valerie, a new NPS law enforcement officer at Horsethief Trail National Park, investigates the deaths of three children and the disappearance of the teenage boy. The two storylines converge powerfully in the final chapter.",
            "The book offers valuable historical insights into the guardianship of Choctaw children, revealing how many were taken in to allow their guardians control over their land and finances. Numerous children were abandoned or sent to boarding schools, while others lived independently, earning the nickname \"elf children\" due to their slender frames and remarkable ability to conceal themselves.\n",
            "I've always been drawn to this author's works, having found past titles like *Before We Were Yours*, *Before and After*, and *The Book of Lost Friends* to be outstanding and immensely engaging. This latest book is no exception, though it features a unique structure."

The two storylines converge in the final chapter.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**  \n  The book provides historical insights into how Choctaw children were taken into guardianship, often so their guardians could control their land and money.

In contrast, the 1990 timeline follows Valerie, a dedicated National Park Service ranger, as she seeks to uncover the mystery of a missing teenage boy.",

The book examines the ensuing exploitation and corruption, as unscrupulous individuals sought to acquire land, timber, and oil. It also sheds light on the plight of numerous orphans who fell under the care of corrupt guardians, often after their parents suffered untimely accidents. In a troubling echo of the past, the 1990 timeline reveals that these corrupt practices continue, as higher-ups attempt to cover up the discovery of murdered indigenous remains belonging to three young girls found in a cave."

            "This story employs a dual timeline format, which I truly appreciate when executed effectively, and this one succeeds beautifully. The 1909 timeline follows Ollie Radley, a kind and courageous protagonist fleeing her abusive stepfather. Meanwhile, the 1990 timeline centers on Valerie Boren O'Dell, one of the first female rangers assigned to a national park, as she investigates a missing person case. Both timelines are compellingly crafted; while I found myself favoring the earlier period, the narratives evolve seamlessly and intertwine to create a cohesive and engaging experience. The mystery surrounding the missing person case in the 1990 timeline adds an intriguing layer to the story, making it all the more captivating.",

            "This meticulously researched historical novel unfolds in Oklahoma's Winding Stair Mountains, exploring the abuse and exploitation of orphaned Indigenous children from the Choctaw Nation. It also celebrates the courage of pioneer women who fought to protect these vulnerable children. The narrative weaves in intriguing aspects of Oklahoma's history from the 1990s, particularly related to a missing person case."

        "conclusion": "This is a well-crafted historical novel with a compelling dual timeline, rich in Oklahoma history and featuring strong, memorable characters. The research and storytelling are excellent, making it a great choice for fans of historical fiction.",

Along the way, she meets and gathers \"elf children,\" showcasing her resilience and bravery.\n   - Liv, a Forest/Law Ranger from the 1990s storyline, is another compelling character. Her investigation into the bones of children found in a cave intersects with Ollie's story, revealing the historical truths.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**\n   - The book addresses themes of abuse, survival, and the mistreatment of Native children. It also highlights the role of a lady politician who champions the cause of Native children, helping to bring this dark history into the open.\n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation:**\n   - This was a really good book and a very worthwhile read. The way the storylines intersect and the historical revelations make it a compelling and educational experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel is a richly layered narrative that combines historical education with compelling character arcs and a complex plot structure.

She finds something in history we were never taught and explodes it into a story with a compelling historical base. The novel sheds light on Kate Barnard, who was elected in Oklahoma when it first became a state, and her reference to \"elf children,\" which were actually Indian children who became wards so their land and oil rights could be stolen. Most of these children were orphans, and Lisa brings this heartbreaking story to her readers.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The story features compelling characters across two time periods. In 1909, we meet Ollie as a child, and her story is one that readers can deeply empathize with. In 1990, National Park Ranger Valerie and her son Charlie guide us through the tale, adding another layer of connection and depth to the narrative.  \n\n- **Engagement and Pacing:**  \n  I couldn’t put the book down until I learned both of the stories. The dual timelines of 1909 and 1990 are seamlessly woven together, keeping the reader engaged and eager to uncover the connections between the two eras.  \n\n- **Educational Value:**  \n  The novel not only entertains but also educates. As a lover of historical fiction, I was captivated by the history and found myself wondering why I had never heard this story before. Lisa Wingate has a gift for bringing forgotten or overlooked historical events to life in a way that feels both enlightening and deeply personal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLisa Wingate’s novel is a masterful blend of historical research, compelling characters, and a gripping narrative that keeps readers hooked from start to finish.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The novel employs a dual-timeline structure, bouncing back and forth over a hundred years. This approach is becoming more common in historical novels, and while it’s not new, it’s used effectively here to weave together past and present events.  \n\n- **Setting and Historical Context:**  \n  The story is set in the backwoods of Oklahoma, a less-explored area in historical fiction. The author vividly portrays a time when the law was often decided by individuals, and racial inequality was rampant, particularly during the oil boom. The historical context highlights the harsh realities of the era, including the disappearance of children and the lack of accountability for those in power.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n  The discovery of bodies in the 1990s unravels long-buried secrets, exposes cruel individuals, and ultimately leads to justice being served. The novel delves into themes of loss, injustice, and the resilience of those who have been forgotten by history.  \n\n- **Research and Emotional Depth:**  \n  The author’s well-researched narrative brings authenticity to the story, making it both informative and emotionally impactful. The focus on children who have lost their place in history adds a poignant layer to the novel.  \n\n- **Author’s Skill and Reception:**  \n  The author has crafted another compelling and thought-provoking read, which is likely to become a bestseller. Her ability to blend historical detail with emotional storytelling is a key strength.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nShelterwood is a well-researched, emotionally charged historical novel that skillfully uses a dual-timeline structure to explore themes of injustice, loss, and resilience. Set in the lesser-known backwoods of Oklahoma, the story uncovers buried secrets and delivers a satisfying resolution. The author’s ability to bring forgotten histories to life makes this a standout read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "The book skillfully intertwines two timelines: one centered on the historical events surrounding Native children and Kate Barnard, and the other following a contemporary National Park Ranger. Each storyline is compelling on its own, but together they form an intricate and captivating narrative that’s hard to put down.",

Additionally, the contemporary story of the National Park Ranger enriched the narrative, adding depth and relevance to the historical events and making the book even more engaging.",
            "The author meticulously researched the story of the \"elf children\" in Oklahoma during the early 1900s. The narrative effectively highlights the historical context of the abuse and neglect faced by Native children, who were exploited by guardians for land and money.",
            "This book uncovers a long-hidden chapter of Oklahoma's history, stirring deep emotions and highlighting the injustices faced by Native children. It effectively conveys themes of resilience, advocacy, and the struggle for justice, leaving a profound and lasting impact."

            "The novel employs a dual-story format, alternating between 1909 and 1990. While this technique enriches the narrative, the frequent shifts in timelines can be disorienting. In the 1990 storyline, the discovery of three children's skeletons in a cave ignites a mystery that a new female ranger feels compelled to investigate, despite the indifference of her colleagues. Meanwhile, the 1909 timeline centers on abandoned children—both white and Native American—struggling to survive. The Native American orphans face exploitation by a sponsor who misappropriates their oil money, while a white girl escapes an abusive stepfather and a neglectful mother.",

The other two books, though, are beyond the best.  \n\n- **Adaptation Potential:**  \n  How have none of her books been made into movies already? Reese Witherspoon, let’s get on that!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is another fantastic book by Lisa Wingate, filled with rich historical content and an engaging narrative.

            "The secondary characters, particularly the children—Charlie, Sydney, Blake, and Rachel—are well-developed and notably avoid stereotypes. For instance, Sydney and Blake, who could have easily fallen into the cliché of foster kids, instead possess distinct personalities and ambitions. Nessa and the other children Ollie encounters further enrich the narrative, reflecting the themes of adoption and family responsibilities prevalent in the author's previous works. The striking parallels between Ollie and Valerie add depth to the story. Despite being separated by a century and an age difference, both characters grapple with similar core challenges: forging their identities in a world that marginalizes them and coping with the loss of loved ones. Ollie fights to survive and redefine herself beyond the limitations imposed by Tesco Peele, while Valerie struggles to endure for herself and her son.",

It addresses women's rights in the 1890s and the struggles of orphaned children, portraying its characters with depth rather than as mere victims. The narrative highlights enduring injustices across centuries while skillfully avoiding preachy or clichéd conclusions.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Emotional Impact and Connection:**  \n  - Lisa Wingate's storytelling touches me deeply and teaches me about parts of history I knew nothing about.  \n  - The story is heartbreaking yet uplifting, showcasing the resilience and strength of the characters.  \n  - The historical timeline (1909) particularly moved me, as it reflects a time when Native American children were robbed of their land rights and highlights the strong women who worked to protect them.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  - In the 1909 timeline, I was drawn to Olive Radley, an eleven-year-old who is caring, smart, and determined to protect six-year-old Nessa, a Choctaw girl, from her abusive stepfather.  \n  - In the 1990 timeline, Valerie Boren-O’Dell, a young widow and park ranger, is portrayed as tenacious and strong, mirroring Olive's resilience as she works to solve the mystery of discovered bones.  \n\n- **Historical Significance and Execution:**  \n  - The dual timelines (1909 and 1990 in Oklahoma) are skillfully executed, showcasing Wingate's ability to weave historical significance into her narratives.  \n  - The story transports readers to a place and time that informs them of important historical events while also engaging them emotionally.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  - I highly recommend this book to those who loved *Before We Were Yours* and anyone who enjoys well-crafted historical fiction.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLisa Wingate's novel is a powerful and emotionally resonant work of historical fiction that skillfully intertwines dual timelines to highlight important historical events and the strength of its characters. While both timelines are compelling, the 1909 narrative particularly stands out for its emotional depth and historical significance. This book is a must-read for fans of Wingate's previous works and anyone who appreciates historical fiction that both educates and moves the heart.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This novel unfolds across dual timelines set in the Winding Stair Mountains of eastern Oklahoma—one in 1909 and the other in 1990. The 1909 narrative follows an eleven-year-old girl and her six-year-old Choctaw ward as they flee from the malevolent intentions of the girl's stepfather. Along their journey, they encounter other wild children and form a makeshift community. Meanwhile, the 1990 storyline introduces a new female park ranger seeking a fresh start after her husband's death. She becomes embroiled in the search for a missing teenager and uncovers a long-hidden burial site for three children in a cave. The two narratives ultimately converge, with the author skillfully intertwining their plots.\n\nInitially, it took me some time to engage with the book, as the 1909 storyline felt clichéd and slow to develop. In contrast, the 1990 narrative, with its procedural elements, progressed more rapidly and consistently captured my interest. The author effectively weaves together the dual timelines, creating a cohesive narrative focused on character and story rather than historical detail. This approach makes the book engaging for readers who prioritize character-driven storytelling.",
            "In this 1909 story, the young white girl narrator presents a challenge in addressing the issue of land theft from Indian orphans. In contrast, the 1990 storyline has a more procedural tone, reminiscent of Nevada Barr's writing, and maintains a quicker pace. I found myself more engaged in both narratives as the book progressed into its second half.",
            "The 1909 storyline focuses on the theft of land from Indian orphans, a theme that is fully explored only halfway through the novel during a political rally. It raises important questions about the relevance of historical fiction to contemporary issues, as illustrated by the quote, “It is an abomination, Hazel, that our society can muster the wit and will to create such magnificence, yet not resolve to do right by a child, don’t you think?” While I generally prefer historical fiction that emphasizes factual details, the author does provide useful context in her Author's Note."
        ],
        "conclusion": "*Shelterwood* is a dual-timeline novel that explores themes of injustice, resilience, and community. While the 1909 storyline starts slowly and takes time to delve into its central issue, the 1990 storyline provides a faster-paced, procedural counterpoint. The author successfully ties the two narratives together, though I wished for more historical detail within the story itself. Overall, it’s a compelling read for those who enjoy character-driven historical fiction with a touch of mystery.",

            "Set in Oklahoma across two timelines—1909 and 1999—this story intricately weaves together themes of land and the exploitation of children. In 1909, we follow eleven-year-old Olive Augusta Radley, who grows increasingly concerned for two Choctaw children boarding in her home. When the older girl goes missing, Olive escapes with the younger girl, Nessa, into the outlaw-infested Winding Stair Mountains. Along their journey, they encounter other exploited children and form a close-knit group. Fast forward to 1999, where Ranger Valerie Boren O'Dell, a newcomer to the park, faces turmoil after a teenager goes missing during a hike.

            "The story unfolds through alternating timelines set in 1909 and 1990 Oklahoma. The 1909 timeline centers on Ollie, an eleven-year-old girl, and Nessa, a Choctaw girl, as they escape an abusive environment in search of a safe haven they call Shelterwood. Meanwhile, the 1990 timeline follows Valerie Boren-Odell, a park ranger investigating the disappearance of a teenager and the troubling discovery of children's bones in a local cavern, despite her superior's objections. Each chapter begins with news excerpts, providing historical context about land barons and the guardianship of orphaned Native children. While both timelines start strong, the 1909 narrative eventually becomes repetitive, hindered by the children's squabbles and a troublemaking boy that disrupts the flow. The merging of the timelines feels abrupt, leading to a lack of clarity, and the ending is rushed and confusing, as one character attempts to explain the connection between the timelines and the events at Shelterwood.",
            "Valerie's storyline was genuinely captivating. As a park ranger raising her young son alone after her husband's death, she confronts workplace sexism, finding herself assigned to desk duties while less experienced colleagues tackle more significant tasks. Her collaboration with Curtis, a tribal police officer, along with her interactions with fellow rangers, added depth to the narrative. Ollie's character was both precocious and resourceful, showcasing impressive survival skills and storytelling abilities, though his tendency to dominate conversations could become a bit tiresome at times.",
            "The novel delves into a significant historical issue: the exploitation of orphaned Native children and their properties by land barons. The use of news article excerpts enhances the narrative, adding depth and context to the story."

The characters were well-written, and the plot shed light on an important but often overlooked aspect of history.

            "The novel seamlessly weaves together two timelines—1909 and 1990—that converge to unveil a haunting history of abuse against the Choctaw indigenous tribe. In 1909, eleven-year-old Olive, an aspiring storyteller, escapes her abusive stepfather with her younger companion, Nessa. They find refuge in the woods, living among other malnourished children who are mistakenly believed to be elves. Fast forward to 1990, when Valerie Boren-Odell, a new Law Enforcement Ranger, investigates the mysterious disappearance of a teenager and his grandmother. Her search leads her to a cave containing three skeletons, linking the two timelines. The narrative is engaging and offers a compelling glimpse into a lesser-known historical context, although the numerous characters across both timelines can be difficult to track.",
            "Olive is a resourceful and resilient character who skillfully uses her gift of gab to navigate perilous situations. Meanwhile, Valerie is a strong and determined woman working to prove herself in a male-dominated field while also balancing the challenges of single motherhood.",
            "This well-researched novel provides an insightful examination of the history of Indigenous children and the systemic abuse they endured. It echoes themes from the author’s previous work, *Before We Were Yours*, particularly in its exploration of child exploitation.",
            "This book powerfully illustrates the exploitation of children, especially indigenous youth, who were coerced into signing away their family lands or subjected to harsh labor. It exposes the greed of guardians who prioritized profit from the land's resources—timber, oil, and minerals—over the welfare of these children. Additionally, the narrative honors the contributions of reformers like Kate Barnard, who bravely sought to reveal and combat child abuse and labor exploitation."

        "conclusion": "*Shelterwood* is a compelling historical novel that skillfully weaves together two timelines to expose the heartbreaking abuse of indigenous children and the greed that fueled their exploitation.

Their meticulous research shines through, bringing lost narratives to life with authenticity. The plot alternates between the lives of three girls in 1909 and a female park ranger's investigation into skeletons discovered in a cave in 1990. Who were these children, and why are authorities reluctant to uncover the truth?",
            "In this gripping tale, we follow Ollie and Nessa as they flee from their lecherous stepfather. However, at just 11 and 6 years old, their independence exposes them to even greater dangers. These characters evoke deep compassion, and readers will find their hearts racing throughout the journey.",

It only took about half an hour more for me to get fully invested in the story.\n\n- **Narration and Performance:**  \n  The narration is great. Both Christine Larkin and Jenna Lamia do a wonderful job. I especially like Lamia’s interpretation of the children’s voices.\n\n- **Historical Context and Research:**  \n  This is a United States History subject that I was not familiar with. I am glad that Lisa Wingate chose to research this era and the people in Oklahoma who were involved. I learned about the Trail of Tears (forced displacement, murder) so that their land could be requisitioned (stolen), but I didn’t know about land-owning natives who were left behind and what became of them and their children. It is a sickening story.\n\n- **Plot Structure and Storytelling:**  \n  The story is told in two timelines. In 1990, a National Park Service police officer, Valerie, begins her new job, which puts her in the middle of some disturbing circumstances. In 1909, eleven-year-old Ollie is worried about her missing adopted Choctaw sister, and due to foul play, she decides to flee with her younger sister. The chapters go back and forth between each timeline, always leaving you on a cliffhanger.\n\n- **Themes and Social Commentary:**  \n  The book brings to light stories about women pioneers who fought for the abandoned children and what was done to them. At the end of the audiobook, the author shares how she got the idea to write the book and provides additional reading suggestions.\n\n- **Content Warnings:**  \n  If you can stomach the insinuation of child abuse (no graphic details) and want to know more about the abandoned native children during the land-grab, this is a great book.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis book offers a compelling and educational narrative, blending historical research with a gripping dual-timeline plot. While it starts slow, it quickly becomes engaging, with excellent narration and a powerful exploration of a lesser-known chapter in U.S. history.

            "Set in Talihina, Oklahoma, this novel unfolds across two alternating timelines: 1990 and 1909. In 1990, Valerie Boren-Odell, a new park ranger, grapples with her frustration over a lack of significant assignments while investigating the discovery of three young girls' skeletons in a cave. Meanwhile, the 1909 timeline follows Olive Augusta Peele, a young white girl, and Nessa Rusk, a Choctaw girl, as they confront the theft of land rights from orphaned Choctaw children and the threats posed by Olive's stepfather. These timelines intricately weave together, gradually revealing their connections and building suspense. The well-structured narrative combines engaging storytelling with educational insights, seamlessly blending historical facts into a captivating fictional tale.",
            "In this story, Valerie Boren-Odell emerges as a determined and capable protagonist, grappling with the challenges of being perceived as the token female. Olive Augusta Peele is a courageous and compassionate character who goes to great lengths to protect Nessa and other homeless children. Miss Kate Barnard stands out as an inspiring historical figure, embodying hope and advocacy for the vulnerable.",
            "The novel delves into themes of injustice, particularly the exploitation of orphaned Choctaw children and the theft of their land rights. It showcases the resilience of women and children while also highlighting historical figures like Miss Kate Barnard, who championed the rights of homeless children. By illuminating lesser-known historical events, the story emphasizes the significant contributions of women and children in shaping history."

        "conclusion": "Shelterwood is a captivating work of historical fiction that skillfully intertwines two timelines to explore themes of injustice, resilience, and advocacy. The novel's strong characters, well-paced narrative, and focus on little-known history make it a memorable and thought-provoking read. I highly recommend it to fans of historical fiction and those interested in stories highlighting the roles of women and children.",

            "This story unfolds through two alternating timelines: 1909 and 1990 Oklahoma. In the 1909 timeline, we follow Ollie, an eleven-year-old girl, and Nessa, a Choctaw girl, as they escape an abusive situation and strive to build a community called Shelterwood in the woods. The 1990 timeline centers on Valerie Boren-Odell, a park ranger investigating a missing teenager and the discovery of children’s bones in a local cavern, despite pushback from her superiors. Each chapter begins with excerpts from news articles that offer historical context about land barons and the guardianship of orphaned Native children.\n\nWhile Valerie’s storyline is consistently engaging, highlighting her personal and professional challenges, Ollie’s story starts strong but loses momentum due to repetitive conflicts among the children. The merging of the timelines feels abrupt, leading to a loss of narrative direction, and the rushed ending introduces confusion as one character clarifies the connection between the timelines. Overall, these elements detract from the story's enjoyment.",

Her collaboration with Curtis, a tribal police officer, adds depth to her investigative journey. Ollie stands out as a precocious and resourceful character, with a natural talent for survival and storytelling, though his tendency to dominate conversations can be tiresome. Additionally, the children’s squabbling, particularly one boy’s troublemaking in the 1909 timeline, disrupts the story's flow and can be frustrating.",

The story started out really strong, and I was fully engaged. I loved the early 1900s setting and the inclusion of children in the narrative. The alternating time periods, a feature I always appreciate in historical fiction, initially drew me in.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Research:**  \n  The book sheds light on a historical aspect I was previously unaware of, and I found this enlightening. Reading the author's notes provided additional insight, which I highly recommend.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  However, the story fell short for me. There seemed to be many holes in the misadventures of the girls and children, making some of their experiences hard to believe. The storyline began to feel slow, and I struggled to stay engaged. There wasn't enough plot development to maintain my interest, and I found myself pushing through to finish.  \n\n- **Character Development and Realism:**  \n  The 1990s timeline, which followed a female park ranger, initially intrigued me. As a lover of national parks, I was excited by the beginning mystery. However, as the plot progressed, events became increasingly unrealistic, making it difficult for me to accept the narrative, even if such events might have occurred in real life.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  While the historical aspects highlighted in the book were interesting and worth learning about, the journey felt slow and unsatisfying. I didn't love the overall experience, though I appreciated the effort to bring lesser-known history to light.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe book had a promising start with its engaging setting and historical context, but it ultimately fell short due to pacing issues, plot holes, and a lack of realism. While the historical insights were valuable, the storytelling didn't hold my interest throughout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

I appreciated how the two timelines were distinct yet interconnected, showing how historical events impact the future in unique ways.  \n   - The early 1900s timeline, following Ollie and a group of orphaned \"elf children\" living in the woods, was adventurous but sometimes felt outrageous and random.  \n   - The 1990s timeline, featuring Valerie, a new park ranger, was frustrating due to its reliance on false leads and disconnected clues. However, the final chapter of this timeline was highly interesting and introduced two characters with a compelling story that I wish had been the focus.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing in the middle of the book was incredibly slow, making it difficult for me to stay engaged.  \n   - I often found myself reluctant to pick up the book, and when I did, I would only read a chapter before putting it down again.  \n\n- **Research and Themes:**  \n   - It’s clear that a lot of research went into the book, and the themes of land rights and indigenous children are important and compelling.

            "The novel unfolds across dual timelines: one follows a group of \"elf children\" and the white settlers ostensibly trying to save them, yet secretly seeking control over their land. The other timeline centers on a new female park ranger who uncovers a potential murder mystery while navigating her new role and single parenting. The story begins strongly, but the middle section tends to feel repetitive, as the children frequently find themselves in trouble while the park ranger encounters dead ends in her investigation. This repetitiveness makes it challenging to stay engaged. However, the final 20%, including the epilogue and author's notes, proves to be the most compelling part of the book.",
            "The author adeptly addresses historical injustices involving children, making this book a standout in a genre often dominated by WWII narratives. While the subject matter is engaging, the middle sections of the story lag, featuring repetitive cycles that diminish the overall momentum.",
            "This novel poignantly addresses the treatment of Indigenous people and the theft of their lands, focusing on Oklahoma, where forced relocation preceded the appropriation of their valuable territories. It also examines themes of orphans, stolen children, and systemic injustice—recurring motifs in the author’s work."
        ],
        "conclusion": "Overall, *Shelterwood* is a thought-provoking historical fiction novel that sheds light on the injustices faced by indigenous people and stolen children. While the beginning and ending are strong, the middle section struggles to maintain momentum. The author's expertise in writing about these themes is evident, but the execution falls short in parts. It’s a worthwhile read for fans of historical fiction, especially those interested in lesser-known historical injustices.",

Wingate is a masterful Historical Fiction novelist, and this book stays true to her genre expertise.  \n\n- **Narrative Structure and Timeline:**  \n  The story alternates timelines each chapter, shifting between Ollie in 1909 and Valerie in 1990. I enjoyed how the two timelines eventually intertwined by the end, though the pacing felt slow at times.  \n\n- **Character Development and Engagement:**  \n  I really enjoyed the characters and found myself rooting for all the main characters right up to the very end. Their development and arcs kept me invested in the story.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment and Impact:**  \n  While I did enjoy the book, it lacked a \"wow\" factor for me. The story dragged in certain parts, which affected my overall enjoyment.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*Shelterwood* is a well-crafted historical fiction novel with engaging characters and an interesting dual-timeline structure. However, the pacing issues and lack of a standout moment kept it from being a standout read for me.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5/5 (rounded to 3, as half stars are not an option)."

            "The story unfolds across two timelines: 1909, which highlights the struggles of Choctaw Indian children, particularly sisters Olive and Nessa, and 1990, centered on Law Enforcement Ranger Valerie Boren-O’Dell. The discovery of skeletal remains in a cave within the soon-to-be-opened Horsethief Trail National Park sets a compelling premise. However, both timelines feel weighed down; the 1990 narrative revolves around a search for missing persons, while the 1909 storyline follows Olive and Nessa as they encounter an increasing number of orphaned children. Though the connection between the timelines becomes clearer toward the end, it is revealed through a retelling by an elderly Choctaw woman rather than through a natural story progression, which diminishes the emotional connection to the characters.",
            "The writing is outstanding, especially in its vivid portrayals of the forests and rugged landscapes the orphans navigate. However, the narrative occasionally becomes bogged down by excessive information, particularly during lengthy political speeches about orphaned children's struggles. While the research is comprehensive, certain sections feel overdone, disrupting the story's flow and overshadowing the central mystery of the skeletal remains.",
            "While the children's plight is undeniably tragic, the emotional impact of their story is weakened by a disjointed narrative structure. A smoother flow between timelines and a sharper focus on the central mystery would have enhanced both engagement and emotional resonance.",

The alternating timelines and over-researched details make it difficult to stay fully engaged, and the emotional connection to the characters is weakened by the disjointed storytelling.

As a result, I tend to compare all her subsequent works to this book, which may not be entirely fair but is inevitable.  \n\n- **Premise and Plot Structure:**  \n   - The story alternates between two timelines: 1909, focusing on the plight of Choctaw Indian children, particularly sisters Olive and Nessa, and 1990, following Law Enforcement Ranger Valerie Boren-O’Dell.  \n   - The discovery of skeletal remains in a cave within the soon-to-be-opened Horsethief Trail National Park sets up an intriguing premise.

This approach made it harder to maintain an emotional connection to the characters.  \n\n- **Writing Style and Research:**  \n   - Wingate’s writing is excellent, particularly in her vivid depictions of the forests and rugged terrain the orphans traverse. However, the narrative sometimes suffers from information overload, with long-winded political speeches about the plight of orphaned children.  \n   - While Wingate’s research is thorough, some parts feel over-researched, detracting from the story’s flow and making it easy to lose sight of the central mystery of the skeletal remains.  \n\n- **Emotional Engagement and Resolution:**  \n   - The plight of the children is undeniably tragic, but the emotional attachment to their story is diminished by the disjointed narrative structure. A more natural flow between the timelines and a stronger focus on the central mystery would have made for a more engaging and emotionally impactful read.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Shelterwood* has an intriguing premise and showcases Lisa Wingate’s strong writing and research skills, the narrative’s pacing and structure hinder its potential.

            "The novel begins slowly, but this deliberate pacing allows the author to establish a strong foundation for the story. The dual timeline, alternating between Olive Augusta Peele in 1909 and Valerie Boren-Odell in 1990, is skillfully executed and thoughtfully interconnected. Olive’s quest to create a safe haven for herself and the children in her care is both heartwarming and suspenseful, as they evade pursuers. Meanwhile, Valerie's narrative—focused on a national park controversy, a hidden burial site, and a missing hiker—infuses the story with mystery and intrigue. The themes of resilience, family secrets, and the effects of historical injustices are explored with sensitivity, contributing to a rich and engaging reading experience.",
            "Olive Augusta Peele is a compelling protagonist whose fierce determination to protect her sister Nessa and other vulnerable children drives her character. Her backstory, marked by struggles with her stepfather and her mother’s neglect, adds significant depth. In contrast, Valerie Boren-Odell is a strong, independent woman navigating a male-dominated profession while grappling with personal loss and uncovering long-buried family secrets.",

The connection between these timelines remains a mystery until the end, adding intrigue to the narrative. While the early 1900s sections can be dense and difficult to engage with due to their heavy descriptiveness, the 1990 timeline is notably more captivating and enjoyable.",

            "The narrative of \"1909\" centers on 11-year-old Olive and her 6-year-old Choctaw foster sister, Nessa, as they flee an abusive stepfather. Olive is resourceful and quick-witted, adept at navigating tough situations. Their journey through the Oklahoma wilderness leads them to encounter other abandoned children, enriching the story. The 1990 timeline follows Val, a National Park Service law enforcement officer, who faces challenges in her newly assigned Oklahoma park, including scandals that threaten its reputation. She's discouraged from investigating a missing teenager and bones found in a cave. The connection between the two timelines unfolds gradually, but the resolution feels rushed, as if the author hastily tied up loose ends.",
            "The author consistently explores the theme of children suffering at the hands of the very adults who are meant to care for them, a recurring motif in her work."
        ],
        "conclusion": "The author delivers another dual-timeline novel that explores the resilience of children facing adversity. While the 1909 storyline is compelling and well-narrated, the 1990 timeline feels slightly rushed in its resolution. Overall, it’s an engaging read, though not without its flaws.",

            "The book features a dual storyline that shifts between timelines, which is intriguing but ultimately lacks urgency. The pacing is slow and meandering, leaving me anticipating a gripping moment that never materialized. The ending is particularly unsatisfying—the elf children's tale concludes abruptly, and Ollie's storyline is inadequately resolved. Instead of a seamless conclusion, we receive an abrupt recap from an older Nessie, which feels disjointed and leaves many questions unanswered.",

            "Set against the backdrop of the Winding Stair Mountains in Oklahoma, this story unfolds through two timelines: Ollie, an 11-year-old runaway in the early 1900s, and Ranger Valerie Boren-Odell, a National Park Ranger in 1990. Ollie’s journey quickly captivates, as she becomes aware of her stepfather’s danger following the mysterious disappearance of Hazel, a Choctaw orphan who had been taken in by her late father. Determined to escape, Ollie flees with Hazel’s younger sister, Nessa, leading them back to her former family home. Their adventures, along with their alliance with a group of orphans, give rise to local urban legends about elf children.\n\nIn contrast, Ranger Valerie's storyline feels less cohesive. It takes until the book's second half for the two narratives to intertwine, causing the pacing to lag at times. While Ollie's chapters are engaging from the outset, Valerie's sections feel slower and less integrated until much later. This uneven pacing can make the reading experience feel disjointed at moments.",
            "Ollie is a compelling and resourceful protagonist, distinguished by her intelligence and fierce determination to protect Nessa. The heartwarming bond among Ollie, Nessa, and the group of orphans adds significant depth to the narrative. However, Ranger Valerie, while intriguing, lacks the same level of development and engagement as Ollie, making her sections less impactful.",
            "I found the historical context of the story particularly enlightening, especially regarding the mistreatment of Choctaw children and the women who fought to expose these injustices. These historical elements enriched the narrative, making it both educational and emotionally impactful."

        "conclusion": "Overall, *Shelterwood* is a compelling historical novel with a strong focus on Ollie's journey and the historical injustices faced by Choctaw children. While Ranger Valerie's storyline didn’t fully captivate me, the book’s exploration of history and the resilience of its young characters made it a worthwhile read.",

Ollie's storyline immediately engrossed me. She is a bright girl who realizes her stepfather is dangerous after Hazel, a Choctaw orphan taken in by Ollie's late father, disappears. Ollie decides to flee with Hazel's young sister, Nessa, to survive, leading them to her former family home in the mountains. Their adventures and alliance with a band of orphans form the basis of local urban legends about \"elf children.\"  \n  Ranger Valerie's storyline, however, felt less cohesive. It took until over halfway through the book for the two timelines to converge, which made the pacing feel slow at times.\n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Ollie is a compelling and resourceful protagonist. Her intelligence and determination to protect Nessa make her a standout character. The bond between Ollie, Nessa, and the group of orphans is heartwarming and adds depth to the story. Ranger Valerie, while interesting, didn’t feel as fully developed or engaging as Ollie, which made her sections less impactful.\n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**  \n  I appreciated learning about the history behind the story, particularly the severe mistreatment of Choctaw children and the women who fought to bring these injustices to light. The historical elements added richness and depth to the narrative, making it both educational and emotionally resonant.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The dual timelines took time to connect, which affected the pacing. Ollie's story was gripping from the start, but Valerie's sections felt slower and less integrated until later in the book. This uneven pacing made the reading experience somewhat disjointed at times.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Shelterwood* is a compelling historical novel with a strong focus on Ollie's journey and the historical injustices faced by Choctaw children. While Ranger Valerie's storyline didn’t fully captivate me, the book’s exploration of history and the resilience of its young characters made it a worthwhile read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n⭐️⭐️⭐️.5  \n\nThank you to NetGalley, Random House Ballantine, and Lisa Wingate for the opportunity to read and review an early copy of *Shelterwood*, coming out on 6/4/24."

While the shifting timelines create suspense with cliffhangers, the abrupt transitions disrupt the narrative flow, making it difficult to maintain engagement. Ollie's story concludes abruptly, with future events summarized by another character rather than depicted, which is unsatisfying. Additionally, the resolution feels rushed, tying up loose ends too quickly and presenting at least one implausible event involving the villain.",

Typically, I find time-shifts challenging, particularly when the connection between the timelines is unveiled only at the end. This constant switching made it difficult to follow the plot and created an emotional distance from both narratives. The pacing was sluggish, only gaining momentum in the final quarter. At 368 pages, the novel felt unnecessarily long, making the reading experience often feel more like a chore than a pleasure.",

Meanwhile, the 1990 narrative centers on Valerie Boren O’dell, a newly widowed park ranger, and her curious son Charlie as they seek a new beginning in Oklahoma. The multitude of characters can be difficult to follow, further complicated by the alternating timelines.",

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Narrative Structure and Timeline:**  \n   - The novel employs a dual-timeline structure, alternating between 1909 and 1990, with two narrators.  \n   - I am generally not a fan of novels that move back and forth in time, especially when the connection between the timelines is revealed only at the end.  \n   - The constant switching between storylines made it harder to follow and kept me emotionally distant from both narratives.  \n\n- **Character Development and Complexity:**  \n   - The 1909 storyline is narrated by 12-year-old Olive Augusta Radley, a runaway who meets other children living independently in a time without social services or child labor laws.  \n   - The 1990 storyline follows Valerie Boren O'dell, a newly widowed woman ranger, and her inquisitive son Charlie, as they navigate a fresh start in Oklahoma.  \n   - There are many characters to track, which was made more challenging by the shifting timelines.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n   - The novel explores historical and contemporary issues, including the treatment of indigenous people, child exploitation, political action, and dysfunctional families.  \n   - While the themes are rich, I found the focus on White characters less compelling and wished for more emphasis on indigenous perspectives.  \n\n- **Pacing and Engagement:**  \n   - The pacing felt slow, with the story only picking up momentum in the final quarter of the book.  \n   - At 368 pages, the novel felt overly long, and reading it often felt like a task rather than a pleasure.  \n\n- **Historical and Social Context:**  \n   - The author weaves in historical elements, such as the role of Kate Barnard, the first woman elected to statewide office in Oklahoma, and the struggles of abandoned children.  \n   - The novel also touches on contemporary issues like sexism in the workplace and the challenges faced by women rangers.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Shelterwood* has a rich thematic foundation and explores important historical and social issues, its dual-timeline structure, slow pacing, and focus on White characters made it less engaging for me.

While Ollie and Nessa's journey is engaging and fraught with challenges, the pacing between the timelines is uneven. The 1990 storyline, in particular, lacks the depth and investment found in the 1909 narrative.",

            "The book suffered from a convoluted and overly lengthy narrative, characterized by a painfully slow pace. The dual timeline structure (set in 1909 and 1990) was challenging to engage with, as both timelines progressed sluggishly, making it difficult to favor one over the other. The ending felt rushed, delivering a flurry of information too quickly. Given the earlier slow pace, a tighter edit of the beginning would have allowed for a more developed conclusion. However, I did appreciate the way the two timelines intersected, which added an intriguing layer to the story.",
            "In the 1909 timeline, Ollie emerges as a deeply developed character, showcasing compassion and resilience through her skillful storytelling to navigate challenges. In contrast, Valerie, the Park Ranger in the 1990 timeline, feels less fleshed out. Her narrative mainly underscores the themes of greed and injustice, but lacks significant events that would engage the reader.",
            "I appreciate the author’s attempt to highlight the historical injustices in Oklahoma, where avaricious white men swindled Native tribes out of their land and exploited Native children by becoming their legal guardians. The portrayal of women organizing rallies to raise awareness for neglected and homeless children enriches the historical narrative."

In 1990, newly widowed Valerie Boren O'Dell, one of the first female rangers in a national park, investigates missing persons cases while striving to assert herself in a male-dominated field.

Both timelines feature children depicted with depth, highlighting their resilience and strength.",

The 1909 narrative follows eleven-year-old Olive Augusta Radley as she embarks on a perilous journey to protect herself and a young Choctaw girl, Nessa, from exploitation. In the 1990 storyline, Law Enforcement Ranger Valerie Boren O'Dell uncovers long-buried secrets related to the land's tragic history while balancing her career and single motherhood. The lives of Ollie and Val intertwine as they navigate the wild and beautiful landscape of Oklahoma, each leaving one life behind in search of another.",

            "In *Shelterwood*, the dual timelines set in 1909 and 1990 ultimately falter, with alternating chapters and a myriad of characters leading to confusion and frustration. I found myself skipping parts about the children to reach the concluding chapter, hoping for a satisfying resolution. Instead, the mystery surrounding three skeletons is resolved in a single, flippant sentence. Additionally, the appearance of a child from 1909 as a 100-year-old woman in 1990 comes across as awkward and unconvincing.",
            "I appreciate how the author sheds light on the lost children among us—vital stories that deserve to be told. The narrative of the elf children intertwined with the fate of Native Americans during the early days of Oklahoma statehood is particularly compelling, reminiscent of the insights found in *Killers of the Flower Moon*."

Alternating chapters between 1909 and 1990 — with a dozen characters in each of the two stories — was confusing and downright annoying.  \n   - I finally skipped a few chapters about the children just to get to the final chapter, where I hoped Wingate would tie it up.  \n\n- **Character Development and Plot Integration:**  \n   - The “mystery” of 3 skeletons gets resolved in one sentence, just with the snap of her fingers.  \n   - Somehow, a child in the 1909 chapters shows up as a 100-year-old woman in 1990, which felt clumsy.  \n\n- **Extraneous Storylines and Distractions:**  \n   - I wish Ms. Wingate would tell these important stories without adding storylines that detract from her message.  \n   - Adding a jumbled modern-day heroine/mystery/budding romance gave me a way out of the morass Wingate created…but I don’t think that was her intent.  \n   - The lost children got lost again.

            "The narrative follows Ollie Auggie, a white girl in 1909, who seeks to escape her abusive stepfather alongside several Indian girls, some referred to as \"elf children.\" In 1990, Val, a single mother and National Park Ranger, investigates the discovery of three young girls found in a cave on park land. Her investigation reveals a horrifying history of child abuse from the early 1900s that connects to Ollie's story. The plot also includes elements of potential kidnapping, death, and the mysterious disappearances of a young girl's brother and grandmother. The author skillfully intertwines the two timelines—Ollie's plight in 1909 and Val's inquiry in 1990—crafting a compelling narrative. However, the frequent shifts between the timelines can disrupt the story's flow at times.",

It sheds light on the historical exploitation of vulnerable children, particularly orphans, whose guardians misused their land allotments or abused their authority. The inclusion of Kate Barnard, Oklahoma's first female elected official and a champion for children's and women's rights, enriches the historical context. The novel is commended for its historical accuracy, vividly depicting legal abuses and the struggle for justice. This exploration of historical injustices adds both depth and complexity to the narrative.",

It takes a long time for the two stories to intersect, with the connection only becoming clear around 70% through. The climax feels rushed and lacks depth, leaving the resolution unsatisfying. Valerie's timeline revolves around a mystery involving three old sets of bones found in a cave on federal park land, while Ollie's focuses on two young girls escaping an abusive stepfather and their struggles in the wilderness.

Overall, it was neither a book I hated nor one I particularly liked—it simply felt underwhelming.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

It begins with the story of three little girls, two of whom are Choctaw and one, Olive, who is the biological daughter of a mother addicted to opium. Olive’s father has passed away, and her mother has remarried an evil man who is hinted at sexually abusing the Choctaw girls.

Interwoven with this narrative is another story set in the 1990s about a park ranger who has lost her husband and moves to Oklahoma to start over.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The book became confusing due to its frequent jumps between the two timelines.

This book retains these elements, showcasing her ability to tackle serious issues like child abuse, exploitation, sexism, and federal land use.  \n\n- **Character Connection:**  \n  I didn’t feel a strong connection to either of the main characters, which made it harder to fully engage with their stories.  \n\n- **Narrative Balance:**  \n  While the book addresses important themes, the storytelling sometimes felt overwhelmed by the explanations, making it come across as too \"preachy.\" The balance between the narrative and the social commentary could have been better.  \n\n- **Overall Impact:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book is likely to sell well and deserves to be read due to its exploration of significant societal issues. However, I didn’t find it as compelling as Wingate's other works.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis novel tackles weighty and important themes, but the storytelling occasionally falters under the weight of its social commentary. While it retains Lisa Wingate's signature strengths, the lack of character connection and narrative balance made it less impactful compared to her other books.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**  \n- **Plot Structure and Timeline Integration:**  \n   - The novel alternates between two timelines: 1909 and 1990.  \n   - The 1990 sections focus on Valerie, a Park Ranger, who discovers three sets of bones in an Oklahoma cave.  \n   - The 1909 sections follow Ollie and a group of orphans, including Choctaw Indians, in the same Oklahoma mountains.  \n   - The timelines eventually converge, but the resolution feels less satisfying due to the retelling by an old Choctaw woman, which comes across as clinical and emotionless rather than being driven by the characters themselves.  \n\n- **Setting and Atmosphere:**  \n   - Wingate excels at capturing the landscape, immersing the reader in the lush beauty of the mountains and woods.  \n   - The setting in both timelines feels vivid and alive, almost like secondary characters in the story.  \n\n- **Themes and Emotional Depth:**  \n   - The novel explores themes of history, politics, and the emotional struggle of leaving behind a beloved life for something new.  \n   - It also delves into the journey of pushing through uncertainty to find trust and happiness.  \n\n- **Character Development and Perspective:**  \n   - The characters, particularly Ollie and Valerie, are compelling, but the emotional connection is weakened by the detached narrative style of the resolution.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLisa Wingate’s *Shelterwood* is a captivating historical novel that skillfully weaves together two timelines, immersing readers in the beauty of the Oklahoma landscape. While the themes of history, politics, and personal transformation are thoughtfully explored, the emotional impact of the story is somewhat diminished by the clinical resolution. Despite this, the novel remains a rich and engaging read.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Both the book and the subsequent TV special captured my heart, which made me look forward to reading *SHELTERWOOD*.  \n\n- **Initial Engagement with the Story:**  \n  At the beginning, I enjoyed the dual storylines—one set in 1909 and the other in 1990. The concept was intriguing and held my interest.  \n\n- **Character Clarity and Narrative Structure:**  \n  As the story progressed, I struggled to keep the characters straight.

I wish I had access to the character chart from the book discussion booklet that was released recently.  \n\n- **Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n  I think the book could have been more manageable if the chapters were shorter or if the story was divided into distinct parts. For example, Part I could focus on Ollie’s and Nessa’s stories, Part II on the woman ranger and her son, and Part III could bring the two storylines together.  \n\n- **Future Plans and Gratitude:**  \n  Despite the challenges, I plan to revisit and reread this book in the future. I’d like to thank Ballantine Books and NetGalley for providing me with an ARC of this book.

I generally enjoy her storytelling and have loved many of her previous books.  \n\n- **Dual Timeline Execution:**  \n  The dual timeline in this book didn’t work as well as I had hoped. I found myself more engaged with the 1990 storyline and felt disappointed whenever the narrative shifted back to the 1909 time period. The connection between the two timelines, particularly how the bodies found in the cave in 1990 tied into the 1909 events, was not as satisfyingly explained as I had anticipated.  \n\n- **Comparison to Other Works:**  \n  Compared to her other series, such as *Tending Roses*, *Shores of Moses Lake*, and *Carolina*, this book fell short for me. I particularly love *A Thousand Voices* and consider *Before We Were Yours* a standout read. This novel didn’t resonate with me as strongly as those did.  \n\n- **Recommendation for New Readers:**  \n  If you’re new to Lisa Wingate’s work, I would recommend starting with some of her other books rather than this one. Her other series and standalone novels are more compelling and better showcase her talent as a storyteller.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile I am a fan of Lisa Wingate’s writing, this book didn’t meet my expectations. The dual timeline structure felt uneven, and the resolution of the connection between the two storylines left me unsatisfied. I would recommend her other works over this one.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nChanged my rating from 4 to 3."

            "The story unfolds across two timelines, 1909 and 1990, in the Oklahoma territory of Winding Stair Mountain. It poignantly explores the harsh realities faced by orphaned elf children, who were often brutalized, killed, or abandoned to fend for themselves among their tribes. In 1990, the discovery of a burial site of these elves enables a young widowed mother to reclaim her life, assert herself in a male-dominated profession, and unravel a mystery that leads to the imprisonment of several wrongdoers.",
            "This book uncovers a little-known piece of history that, while unfamiliar to me, is not surprising. It delves into the theme of human greed—specifically, the greed of white men at the turn of the 20th century—and illustrates how it often tramples on basic human rights throughout history.",

            "The book is narrated by two characters, Olive in 1909 and Valerie in 1990, both set against the backdrop of Oklahoma. Their paths are destined to intersect, but for most of the narrative, their stories unfold separately. The plot gradually develops, with a significant amount of action and resolution packed into the final sections. While this approach effectively ties up loose ends, some readers may find it feels rushed."

While *Shelterwood* doesn't quite reach the same level, it still holds its own.  \n- **Narrative Structure:**  \n  The book is narrated by two characters, Olive in 1909 and Valerie in 1990. Both storylines are set in Oklahoma, and it’s clear from the start that their paths will eventually converge. However, the plot remains distinct for most of the book, with the two narratives only merging toward the very end.  \n- **Pacing and Plot Development:**  \n  The story takes its time to unfold, with a lot of action and resolution packed into the final sections. This approach ties up loose ends but may feel rushed to some readers.  \n- **Appeal to Readers:**  \n  For fans of Lisa Wingate, *Shelterwood* won’t disappoint, though it may not surpass her earlier works. For new readers, it serves as a decent introduction to her storytelling style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Shelterwood* doesn’t quite match the brilliance of *Before We Were Yours*, it remains a solid addition to Lisa Wingate’s body of work.

While the concept of merging these two stories is intriguing, I found it somewhat confusing and challenging to keep track of both narratives simultaneously.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Olive’s character, as a young girl facing fear and taking bold steps to protect herself and her sister, is compelling.

It was emotionally heavy, sad, and at times difficult to read due to its poignant themes.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, this was a compelling and thought-provoking book that sheds light on a tragic period in history.

I never formed a strong emotional attachment to either character, which detracted from my overall engagement with the story.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel effectively highlights an important and tragic piece of history, the lack of emotional depth in the protagonists made it harder for me to fully connect with the narrative.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n{No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.}"

            "*Shelterwood* weaves together a dual-timeline narrative, unfolding in the 1900s and the 1990s. The 1990s storyline follows Law Enforcement Ranger Valerie Boren O'Dell as she investigates the discovery of two skeletal remains in Oklahoma. Collaborating with the Choctaw Tribal Police, Valerie unearths long-buried secrets that deepen the intrigue of the story. In contrast, the 1900s timeline centers on a group of children in Oklahoma who confront perilous situations involving abusive pedophiles, outlaws, and other menaces. Their quest to forge a safe haven is both harrowing and inspiring. Although the book is compelling, the pacing occasionally feels uneven, and the transition between timelines isn't always smooth.",

The novel employs dual timeframes—1909 and 1990—that ultimately lack a cohesive connection, making it difficult to fully appreciate the narrative.

The story is told through dual timeframes—1909 and 1990—with the 1990 timeline following park ranger Valerie as she investigates the remains of three children found in a new national park. The 1909 timeline focuses on Ollie, a young girl who escapes her abusive stepfather and forms a community with Choctaw children. While the premise is compelling and highlights women pioneers fighting for children's rights, I found it difficult to become fully engrossed in the story. The plot development felt slow, and it took a while for the central conflict to become clear.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters, particularly Ollie and Valerie, are central to the narrative. Ollie's journey of survival and leadership in the \"Shelterwood\" community is intriguing, and Valerie's investigation adds a layer of mystery. However, I didn’t feel as connected to the characters as I had hoped, which made it harder to stay invested in their stories.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The pacing of the novel was uneven, with the plot taking too long to unfold. Additionally, the dual timeframes didn’t mesh well for me, and I felt they lacked a cohesive connection by the end of the story. This disjointed structure made it harder to fully appreciate the narrative.  \n\n- **Research and Authenticity:**  \n  The novel is well-researched and informative, shedding light on an important and often overlooked aspect of history. The attention to detail in portraying the struggles of Native American children and the historical context of land ownership is commendable.  \n\n- **Author Comparison:**  \n  While I absolutely loved Lisa Wingate’s previous work, *While We Were Yours*, this novel didn’t resonate with me in the same way. Despite her skill as an author, *Shelterwood* didn’t leave as strong an impression.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, *Shelterwood* tackles an important and thought-provoking subject with a dual-timeline structure.

While I ultimately loved the connection in the end, the pacing was a bit too slow for me, and it took me much longer than usual to finish.  \n\n- **Themes and Historical Context:**  \n  I am sympathetic to this story because it is part of our history, and I believe we should all be knowledgeable about our history, even through books. Lisa does a great job at explaining and elaborating on these themes.  \n\n- **Tropes and Content:**  \n  The book includes tropes such as found family and child abuse, among others.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  Despite the slow pacing, I would definitely recommend *Shelterwood* because of its historical significance and the emotional connection it fosters by the end.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Shelterwood* had a slower start and took time to fully engage me, the eventual connection between the two POVs and the historical depth of the story made it a worthwhile read. Lisa Wingate’s ability to elaborate on important themes and her compelling storytelling ultimately won me over.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

Their perilous journey to the Winding Stair Mountains is filled with threats from outlaws, treasure hunters, and desperate men. The second timeline, set eighty-one years later, features Valerie Boren O’Dell, a law enforcement ranger investigating the disappearance of a teenage hiker and the hidden burial site of three children in Horsethief Trail National Park.

I don’t love this book structure, which is so popular right now.  \n   - I imagine it’s hard enough to keep one plotline going and maintain consistency, but two must be even harder to pull off.  \n   - Either storyline would have been a better stand-alone book, but neither ever came together into a compelling story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I enjoyed the main character, Val, a single mother and park ranger investigator, who experiences discrimination as a newcomer and a woman.  \n   - I might read another book with Val as the protagonist, but not if it has two storylines in different eras.  \n\n- **Recommendation:**  \n   - Unless you have read every book on your TBR list, I can’t recommend this book.  \n\n- **Acknowledgments:**  \n   - NetGalley provided me with a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the book had potential, particularly with its strong protagonist, Val, the dual-timeline structure detracted from the overall experience.

The premise of uncovering buried secrets is compelling, but the execution falls short.  \n\n- **Narration and Format:**  \n  The audiobook narrator’s voice, particularly their interpretation of 11-year-old Olive August Radley in 1909, was off-putting, prompting a switch to the print version. However, even in print, the book was a painstaking struggle to finish.  \n\n- **Plot and Pacing:**  \n  The dual timelines of 1909 and 1990 feel disjointed, and the pacing is painfully slow.

The plot, while important, is not as compelling as the author’s previous works.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I couldn’t connect with the characters until the very end, which felt rushed and disjointed after 325 dull pages. This lack of connection made the resolution feel disingenuous.  \n\n- **Themes and Representation:**  \n  The Native American stories are important and need to be told, and I felt deeply for the children. However, the emotional impact was overshadowed by the book’s execution issues.  \n\n- **Comparison to Author’s Other Works:**  \n  Other stories by this author have been significantly more engaging than *Shelterwood*, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile *Shelterwood* tackles an important and tragic history, its execution, pacing, and character development fall short.

The discovery of three children's remains in 1990 sparks an investigation into this dark history, setting the stage for a compelling narrative. Unfortunately, the execution falls short, with critical details glossed over or muddled. Major developments occur offstage, weakening their impact and disrupting the story's flow. The pacing is a significant issue; the narrative often feels slow and tedious, filled with repetitive cycles of minor conflicts and unresolved investigations that cause the middle of the book to drag, prompting me to skim.

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n- **Plot and Storyline:**  \n  The novel revolves around the lives of Native American children and the corrupt land grabbers exploiting them. The discovery of three children's remains in 1990 triggers an investigation into this dark past, promising an intriguing plot. However, the execution was lacking, with crucial details either glossed over or presented confusingly. Important developments happened offstage, diminishing their impact and disrupting the story's flow.\n\n- **Pacing:**  \n  The pacing was a major issue. The narrative often felt slow and laborious, with repetitive cycles of minor conflicts and unresolved investigations. This made the middle portion of the book drag, leading me to skim through it. The final sections and the author's notes were more engaging but were too few and far between.\n\n- **Dual Timelines:**  \n  The dual timelines, usually a narrative style I enjoy, were problematic here. The frequent shifts between past and present were jarring, making it hard to stay engaged with either timeline. Just as I became invested in one storyline, the narrative would switch, forcing me to reorient myself repeatedly.\n\n- **Subject Matter and Themes:**  \n  The book sheds light on the plight of Native American children and the surrounding corruption, which is an important and compelling subject. However, the slow pacing and lack of cohesion made it a struggle to fully appreciate the gravity of the themes.\n\n- **Clarity and Cohesion:**  \n  The story's core conflicts were not sufficiently clarified, leaving me confused and disengaged. The lack of cohesion between the timelines and the sluggish pacing further contributed to my overall dissatisfaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nShelterwood tackles an important topic with strong writing and thorough research, but its disjointed timelines and sluggish pacing make it a challenging read. While the final sections and author's notes were more engaging, they were not enough to salvage the overall experience. Despite my struggles with this book, I remain hopeful for Wingate's future projects.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n2 stars."

            "This story unfolds in Oklahoma across dual timelines: one in 1909, following a group of neglected children living independently in the mountains, and the other in 1990, where a park ranger investigates the remains of three children and the disappearance of a teen boy. However, the dual timelines feel superfluous; the narrative would have been more engaging and impactful if it had remained solely in 1909. The 1990 sections, bogged down by multiple mysteries—some related to the past and others seemingly extraneous—slow the pacing with speculation and ruminations from the rangers, leading to little action until the conclusion. The ending is particularly disappointing, as the 1909 storyline abruptly concludes and its resolution is relayed in the 1990 timeline. This approach is unsatisfying; a more compelling narrative would have allowed the events of 1909 to unfold naturally.",
            "The author's insights into the setting and research were captivating, often more so than the actual plot. While the narrative may not resonate with everyone, it offers valuable insights into the elf children of Oklahoma, making it a worthwhile read for those interested in this unique historical aspect."

            "The first half of the story feels sluggish, both in the 1909 and 1990 chapters, leading me to almost give up multiple times. The cliffhangers at the end of several chapters ultimately fell flat when the storylines resumed two chapters later, detracting from the intended tension. Additionally, numerous loose ends left the narrative feeling incomplete. The premise of Ollie, Nessa, and Hazel still being alive after 81 years stretches believability; while it's theoretically possible, it's highly improbable. Nessa, now 87, planning a mountain hike with Ranger Val comes across as laughable and unrealistic.",
            "The story suffers from an overabundance of characters, many of whom add little to the plot. The expanding group of children feels unnecessary. Valerie's struggles for acceptance in her male-dominated workplace remain unresolved, and Charlie's absence in the final chapters leaves his storyline hanging.",

This structure made the story hard to follow at times.  \n\n- **Historical Context and Themes:**  \n  The novel delves into a dark period in Oklahoma’s history, focusing on how Indian children and orphans were cheated out of their land inheritance. The story highlights the underhanded and devious tactics used by men to seize land, amass wealth, and further exploit others. Some children were outright murdered, while others fell victim to more subtle forms of manipulation.  \n\n- **Writing Quality:**  \n  Despite the challenging narrative structure, the story itself was well-written. The author effectively conveyed the gravity and complexity of the historical events.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel’s dual-time-period structure made it difficult to follow, the story was compelling and well-written, shedding light on a tragic and unjust chapter of history.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

            "This story is both captivating and heartbreaking, centering on orphaned children in early 20th century Oklahoma. It explores themes of exploitation, child abuse, and abandonment, particularly emphasizing how white settlers exploited Native Americans to seize their land. The narrative unfolds through a dual timeline, featuring Ollie’s perspective in 1909 as she escapes an abusive home and Valerie O’Dell’s viewpoint as a Law Enforcement Ranger in the 1990s. However, the story feels disjointed and challenging to follow until about three-quarters in, as the two timelines and separate narratives struggle to blend, resulting in confusion rather than cohesion. The pacing is uneven, taking too long for the story to coalesce, and the shifting perspectives disrupt the overall flow, making it difficult to stay engaged.",
            "The novel aims to evoke empathy through elements such as bones discovered in a cave and the mystery of a missing teenage girl. However, I found it difficult to connect emotionally. While the themes are undoubtedly heartbreaking, the effort to piece together the narrative ultimately undermines its emotional impact."

        "conclusion": "While the novel tackles important and poignant themes, its disjointed structure and dual timelines made it challenging to fully connect with the story. The emotional impact was diminished by the effort required to piece together the narrative.",

Even when I tried reading just one timeline and skipping the other temporarily, each part felt slow, plodding, and, quite frankly, sleep-inducing.  \n\n- **Themes and Subject Matter:**  \n  The treatment of the 5 tribes was a topic of great interest to me, but the way it was handled in this book did not hold my attention or meet my expectations.  \n\n- **Engagement and Commitment:**  \n  I read over half the book before deciding to put it down, as I found it increasingly unengaging and hard to stay invested in.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an intriguing premise and a subject matter that initially interested me, the execution—particularly the pacing and dual timeline structure—made it difficult to stay engaged.

In contrast, I was much more invested in Ollie and the other kids, and I would have preferred the story to focus entirely on them.  \n- **Plot Development:**  \n  I had hoped the story would improve or become more engaging as I progressed, but it never did.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the novel failed to hold my interest due to its slow pacing and lack of engagement with Valerie’s storyline. I found the secondary characters, particularly Ollie and the kids, far more compelling and wished the story had centered on them instead.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \nNo specific rating scores were mentioned in the review."

The narrative explores the abuse of orphaned Indian children in Oklahoma and Arkansas about a century ago, highlighting the exploitation of their land by unscrupulous guardians who took control after the children's parents died under mysterious circumstances.

She has written some historical fiction about events that I'd never heard of. Granted, I don't know much about Oklahoma.\n\n- **Plot and Historical Context:**\n   - This is about orphan abuse among Indian children about 100 years ago in Oklahoma and Arkansas. White people would become guardians of Indian children whose parents had been given land but had them mysteriously died. These crooks then took control of the land.\n   - The book is two timelines: Olive, an orphan, in the 1900s and Valerie, a park ranger, in the 1990s.\n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**\n   - I had a little trouble going back and forth with the timelines. The book is slow and maybe just too much detail. The progress of the story was labored. I felt like I was kind of reading through mud.\n   - I ended up skimming a few chapters near the end to finish the book and find out what was going on.\n\n- **Themes and Historical Reflection:**\n   - We have the evil businessman exploiting the land in the 1990s and the evil businessmen exploiting orphan Indian children 80 years before. This certainly was a true shame in our country's history.\n   - The American Indians have suffered injustice.\n\n- **Comparative Reading Experience:**\n   - I read one of William Kent Krueger's books just before this book. In that book, the prejudice against Indians in the 1950s was ugly.\n   - I just started *The Devil Unrest* about the Civil War. Again, another blot on our history that we are all aware of, slavery. As I read what Southerners thought about slavery, I am just appalled. I mean, they really thought it was a good thing. The South also believed the cotton industry made our country what it was and the North was dependent on The South. Secession did not happen in a blink of the eye. It was building for many years. But that is another book, not *Shelterwood*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe book delves into a dark chapter of American history, highlighting the exploitation of Indian children and their land. While the dual timelines and detailed narrative provided depth, the pacing felt slow and cumbersome, leading me to skim parts of the book. The themes of historical injustice are powerful, but the execution made it a challenging read.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- No specific rating scores mentioned in the review."

        "reformatted_ori_review": "**Aspects:**\n\n- **Expectations vs. Reality:**\n   - I thought this book would be right up my alley, given how much I love historical fiction and the description of this book sounded fantastic. Unfortunately, the book itself was a huge letdown.\n\n- **Dual-Timeline Structure:**\n   - Individually, I liked the two timelines. Together, however, it was a mess. I've read countless dual-timeline (or more) books and never had a single problem with them. The difference was that almost every chapter ended abruptly with a cliffhanger, which felt jarring and obnoxious. Instead of starting the next chapter, I'd set the entire book down and go do something else for a while.\n\n- **Characterization:**\n   - So many of the interactions the characters had felt like just parodies and over-exaggerations of \"the bad guys\" or \"the good guys\" that it was eye-rolling at times. While I liked parts of some of them, the \"overacting\" took away from all the characters and my ability to feel something—anything—for them.\n\n- **Pacing and Ending:**\n   - After so much slogging through the book, I haven't seen such a rushed ending in quite a few reads. It felt like the author had missed their deadline and was just phoning it in. The pacing was all over the place, perhaps made worse by the cliffhangers. While we finally get a half-answer to the first \"mystery,\" it was so much of nothing that it was slightly infuriating.\n\n- **Comparison to Author's Other Work:**\n   - A lot of the people who loved this one loved \"Before We Were Yours.\" I gave that one 3 stars and thought it was also a whole lot of over-the-top drama with some of the same character issues found in this. I did like it better than this one, however, but I'm willing to admit that Wingate just may not be an author who writes historical fiction in a way that I enjoy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the book fell short of my expectations, primarily due to its disjointed dual-timeline structure, exaggerated character interactions, and a rushed, unsatisfying ending. While I appreciated some elements, the execution left much to be desired, and I found myself comparing it unfavorably to the author's previous work.\n\n**Rating Scores:**\n- This book: Lower than 3 stars (implied by comparison to \"Before We Were Yours,\" which was rated 3 stars).\n- \"Before We Were Yours\": 3 stars."
