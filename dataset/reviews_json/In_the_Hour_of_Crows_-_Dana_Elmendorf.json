While the story’s whimsical writing style and lack of deeper exploration into the protagonist’s powers detracted from the reviewer’s enjoyment, the book’s intriguing plot and central mystery make it a worthwhile read for fans of poetic and metaphorical storytelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

I often found myself confused about how the characters arrived at the start of the book and had to repeatedly go back to piece together the story.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  The characters were fine, but they didn’t feel fully developed or integrated into the plot. Their backgrounds and motivations were unclear, which added to the confusion about how they ended up in the situations presented.  \n\n- **Author’s Potential in Other Genres:**  \n  I’m curious to know if the author’s young adult (YA) books are better. This novel left me wondering if her strengths lie in a different genre or style.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the novel had an interesting concept, its execution fell short due to a disjointed plot and underdeveloped characters. The lack of clarity made it challenging to stay engaged, and I’m left questioning whether the author’s other works might be more compelling.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores were mentioned in the review.)"

When I read a description that said “Where the Crawdads Sing meets Practical Magic,” I had high hopes and was not disappointed. This book is so good.  \n\n- **Genre and Setting:**  \n  This Southern Gothic magic murder mystery is set in a small Appalachian town and features found family, family drama, a smidge of “touch her and die,” and a lot of whodunnit.  \n\n- **Character Dynamics:**  \n  The character dynamics really drive everything here. I loved how Adaire led Weatherly on a groundbreaking truth-seeking scavenger hunt from beyond the grave. I also enjoyed Weatherly’s persistence in the face of doubt and the judgment she endured from society because of her gift.  \n\n- **Mystical/Magic Elements:**  \n  I found the mystical/magic element(s) of the story to surprisingly be the least interesting.  \n\n- **Character Development and Backstory:**  \n  While many aspects of the story could benefit from being expanded upon—everything surrounding Weatherly’s mom, why Grandmama is the way she is, all things Rook, and even more things Bone Layer—Weatherly’s story of truth and “self-discovery” while in her small Georgia hometown is engrossing.  \n\n- **Nostalgic Vibe:**  \n  I loved the 1980’s vibe.  \n\n- **Desire for Spin-offs or Expanded Stories:**  \n  I need a Rook POV book with that ending. I also need a Bone Layer book because that man has my heart. Sure, some things he did are/were questionable, but just when you start to get some meat and potatoes from the guy, the book ends!  \n\n- **Release and Gratitude:**  \n  Out on June 4th—this book is one not to miss! Thank you to Dana Elmendorf, Harlequin Trade Publishing, and NetGalley for the e-ARC!  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis Southern Gothic magic murder mystery is a captivating read with strong character dynamics and an engrossing story of self-discovery. While some elements could have been expanded, the book’s nostalgic vibe and intriguing characters make it a standout.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

This raises the question of whether her gift is truly a blessing or a curse. The narrative weaves together family drama, unfulfilled love, and several tragic deaths, revealing many truths and secrets along the way. It features a touch of magic, a strong sense of mystery, and a stark contrast between the lives of the wealthy and the impoverished.",
            "I enjoyed \"Weatherly\" overall. The protagonist's determination to uncover her cousin's killer is compelling, especially given her difficult background—abandoned by her mother, unaware of her father's identity, and raised by an unlikable grandmother. Rook stood out to me as the most intriguing character, and I wished there had been more focus on him. I also found Bone Layer to be a captivating addition to the story.",
            "I found certain parts of the story quite shocking, particularly the scenes depicting Weatherly's actions after trying to revive someone from the brink of death. While I found these moments unsettling, I recognize their significance to the overall narrative.",
            "I read this book quickly; it was engaging enough to hold my interest, but it ultimately fell short of my expectations."

        "conclusion": "Overall, I found this book to be pretty good but not jaw-droppingly great. It had its strengths, such as interesting characters and a satisfying ending, but it also had moments that were hard to stomach and some missed opportunities for deeper emotional connections. The story held my interest, but it didn’t fully deliver on the potential I had hoped for.",

It held my interest enough to keep reading, but it didn’t WOW me like I had hoped it would.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n   - I liked Weatherly for the most part. She wanted nothing more than to find out who killed her cousin. She had a hard life—her mother left her, she didn’t know who her father was, and her grandmother was mean and not likable at all.  \n   - I loved Rook and wished there had been more about him. I think he may have been the most interesting character in the story in many ways.  \n   - I also liked Bone Layer a lot.  \n\n- **Plot and Themes:**  \n   - The book is about a family living in a small town in Appalachia, Georgia. Weatherly Opal Wilder is a death talker who tries to talk death out of people, but it seems like every time she attempts this, the person dies, and she is blamed for their death. This made me question whether her gift was more of a curse.  \n   - The story involves family drama, a lack of love, and a few deaths. Many truths and secrets are revealed throughout the book.  \n   - There’s a bit of a magical presence, a lot of mystery, and a lot of drama. It also contrasts the lives of the poor with those of the rich.  \n\n- **Emotional Impact and Gross-Out Moments:**  \n   - I gagged in places, especially when it talked about what Weatherly did after attempting to bring someone back from the brink of death. It was pretty gross to me, but I understand it was a big part of the story.  \n\n- **Ending and Resolution:**  \n   - I loved how the author wrapped things up in the epilogue. I was hoping things would make a turn for them, and for the most part, I was satisfied with the ending.  \n   - However, there were a few things I wish had been closed more definitively.  \n\n- **Missed Opportunities:**  \n   - I think the book would have been better if Weatherly’s mother had come back when there was a death in the family or if she had been a part of Weatherly’s life in some way. Her supposed love for Weatherly didn’t feel believable to me.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I found this book to be pretty good but not jaw-droppingly great. It had its strengths, such as interesting characters and a satisfying ending, but it also had moments that were hard to stomach and some missed opportunities for deeper emotional connections. The story held my interest, but it didn’t fully deliver on the potential I had hoped for.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n3.5 stars."

Set in the early 1990s, the narrative follows Weatherly, now 24, who continues to live with her grandmother. The tragic death of her best friend and cousin, Adaire, whom Weatherly suspects was murdered and disguised as an accident, shatters their plans to see the ocean together.

            "The story seamlessly blends contemporary fantasy with a mystery subplot as Weatherly delves into her cousin’s death. While themes of Southern history and its legacy are intricately woven into the narrative, they remain a backdrop rather than the central focus.",
            "Weatherly is a compelling protagonist, fueled by her determination to uncover the truth behind her cousin’s death. Her relationship with Rook, a crow who was once a boy, is rich with yearning and emotional depth. Their bond, forged through small, intimate moments, is particularly touching.",
            "Set in small-town Appalachia, the novel vividly captures the region's culture, from its culinary ingredients to its unique magic system and community dynamics. The setting feels authentic and alive, reflecting the author's deep familiarity with Appalachian life. The story confronts Southern history, particularly through a sugar plantation linked to slavery, which Weatherly critiques openly. \n\nThe magic system is both intriguing and satisfying, though not fully explained. Weatherly, as a Death Talker, can bring people back from the brink of death by attracting death to herself. The rules are partially revealed: the ability must be passed to a man (as Weatherly’s grandfather did for her), and a person cannot be revived twice. This system blends various cultural traditions, adding depth while raising questions about its origins. The author’s choice to avoid over-explanation allows readers to intuitively fill in the gaps, which I found enjoyable."

The premise of Weatherly, a Death Talker who can extract death from others and produce Sin Eater Oil, is intriguing and original. The mystery surrounding her cousin Adaire’s death and Weatherly’s determination to uncover the truth drives the narrative forward.  \n\n- **World-Building and Folklore:**  \n  The incorporation of Appalachian folk tales and death superstitions adds depth and richness to the story. However, I sometimes found myself confused due to my lack of familiarity with these traditions. While this made the book intriguing, it also occasionally hindered my understanding of certain elements.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  Weatherly is a compelling protagonist with a unique ability and a strong sense of justice. However, some supporting characters, like Rook and Bone Layer, felt underdeveloped. Rook’s role as a Spirit Walker wasn’t clearly explained, and Bone Layer’s motivations and connection to Weatherly’s family remained unresolved, leaving me with unanswered questions.  \n\n- **Pacing and Structure:**  \n  The novel attempts to tackle multiple themes, characters, and plotlines, which sometimes feels overwhelming. As a result, not all elements are fully developed, and certain aspects of the story, such as Rook’s background and Bone Layer’s significance, feel incomplete.  \n\n- **Overall Enjoyment:**  \n  Despite its flaws, the book was an interesting and engaging read. The unique blend of folklore and mystery kept me invested, even if I wished for more clarity and depth in certain areas.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n*In the Hour of Crows* is a fascinating and original novel that blends Appalachian folklore with mystery and fantasy.

            "The novel centers on Weatherly Wilder, a death talker with the unique ability to remove death from a person, but only once. Her gift is rooted in Appalachian elemental magic, a legacy passed down through her family. The story kicks off with the tragic death of Weatherly's cousin, Adaire, who possesses the ability to glimpse the future in fragments. Adaire's untimely demise in a hit-and-run accident propels Weatherly on a quest for truth and justice. The narrative delves into themes of justice, inequality, and the impact of wealth and power in a small, impoverished town.",

At just nine years old, she inherited the ability to communicate with the dead from her grandfather. Her grandmother's manipulation of this gift through the Sin Eater Oil adds depth to the story. Weatherly's cousin and closest friend, Adaire, plays a crucial role, with her death serving as a catalyst for the narrative. The antagonist, Stone Rutledge, embodies the societal inequalities and corruption that Weatherly must face.",

While the opening scene with the twins is attention-grabbing, I still find myself unclear about its specifics, despite the additional context provided later. My main concern lies with the Rook storyline and the overall significance of crows. Given their prominence in the title and Rook's recurring appearances, I expected their relationship to be more central to the narrative. I would have appreciated more scenes featuring Weatherly and Rook, as well as a stronger connection between their relationship and the main plot.",

Additionally, Bone Layer, who plays a crucial role in the story, intrigued me, yet we learn very little about him.",

Her actions, such as treating her family terribly, made her character unrelatable and frustrating.  \n\n- **Character Development (Papaw):**  \n  Papaw’s character is problematic because he allows the grandmama to be evil and mistreat the family without consequence.

The long memory of the community means she is judged not only for her own actions but also for those of her mother and grandparents.  \n\n- **Plot and Structure:**  \n  The plot was somewhat confusing due to unexpected flashbacks that disrupted the timeline. While everything came together by the end, the narrative felt choppier than it should have. I wished the story had been told in a more straightforward manner.  \n\n- **Characters and Relationships:**  \n  The family relationships were the heart of the book and felt very realistic. Weatherly’s love for her cousin Adaire was evident and deeply moving.  \n\n- **Mystery and Themes:**  \n  Weatherly, a death talker, believes her cousin Adaire’s death was not an accident and suspects the mayor’s involvement. Adaire, who could see the future, had a vision before her death that deeply upset her, adding intrigue to the mystery.  \n\n- **Overall Appeal:**  \n  Despite the structural issues, I enjoyed the setting, characters, and story. If you enjoy small-town, witchy mysteries, this is a great book to check out.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe novel excels in its portrayal of a small-town setting, realistic family dynamics, and intriguing mystery. However, the plot’s structure, with its unexpected flashbacks, made the timeline difficult to follow and the narrative feel choppy. Despite this, the story’s charm and strong character relationships make it a worthwhile read for fans of witchy, small-town mysteries.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"

The concept of a \"death talker\" like Weatherly, who can confuse death with her death song and take it away from someone on the brink of dying, was fascinating. The description of her coughing up \"Sin Eater Oil,\" a black phlegm that her Grandmama collects and uses in potions, added a unique layer to the magical realism.  \n\n- **Character Development:**  \n  I felt that I understood each one of the characters portrayed. At first, I didn’t realize who Gabby was until she spoke of the babies. Weatherly’s character, in particular, was compelling, especially her complex relationship with her Grandmama, who exploited her abilities for profit and terrorized her as a child by burying her with two dead newborns.  \n\n- **Plot and Mystery:**  \n  The main story revolves around Weatherly seeking justice for her cousin Adaire’s death. She uncovers the mystery surrounding her cousin’s murder and follows the clues left behind. The revelation that it all came down to money was impactful, especially when Weatherly discovers she is a Rutledge. The deaths of three people, including her Grandmama, added a tragic layer to the story.  \n\n- **Pacing and Readability:**  \n  I found the storyline easy to read and follow along. The pacing kept me entertained, and the blend of mystery and magical realism, particularly surrounding Rook, the boy, and the crow, was engaging.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book for its rich folklore, well-developed characters, and intriguing mystery. The magical realism elements, such as Weatherly’s abilities and the \"Sin Eater Oil,\" added depth to the story, while the plot kept me hooked until the end.  \n\n**Rating Scores:**  \n(No specific rating scores mentioned in the review.)"
