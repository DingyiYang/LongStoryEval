        "overall_sum": "After Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win for \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1940, her life unfolds amidst considerable racial discrimination, professional stereotyping, and personal struggles. Despite her achievement, she faces criticism, including from the NAACP, and endures racial tensions after moving into a segregated neighborhood in 1941. Her career opportunities dwindle during World War II, leading her to take on \"The Beulah Show\" in 1947, which invites scrutiny over racial stereotypes. Hattie's personal life remains turbulent, marked by a failed reconciliation and subsequent divorce from James. Her marriage to Larry Williams in 1949 ends disastrously, leaving her financially ruined and contemplating suicide by 1950. She finds solace in the support from Hollywood peers like Tallulah Bankhead and friends such as Michael St. John.\nIn 1951, her resilience is tested during divorce proceedings against Larry, while Ethel Waters briefly replaces her on the \"Beulah\" TV adaptation, prompting McDaniel's return despite criticism. Severe health issues beset her as a demanding work schedule leads to a heart attack in August 1951. By November 1951, her health and finances worsen; mounting debts force her to accept financial aid from James. After a second heart attack in February 1952, she's diagnosed with breast cancer and relinquishes her dream home. She becomes the first Black resident at the Motion Picture Country Home Hospital, where she reflects on her legacy and finalizes her will, leaving her Oscar to Howard University.\nBy October 1952, Hattie hosts a dinner party at the hospital despite advisories from friends, aiming to embrace joy in her final days. Physical pain and her friends' concerns underscore her acute challenges, amplified by her accountant Cliff Rogers's counsel on her waning finances. Her plans are abruptly impacted by an unanticipated visit from gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. Although initially tense, Hattie utilizes the meeting to voice her disappointment over racial discrimination regarding her burial wishes, handling the rejection with strength and defiance. Striving to avoid sorrow overshadowing her celebration, Hattie affirms her spirit and respect for her achievements.\nFollowing her death in October 1952, Hedda Hopper reports on the profound impact of McDaniel's life as she succumbs to her illness. Hopper details the elaborate funeral plans, reflecting McDaniel's wish for her death to be a joyful celebration rather than a somber gathering. The anticipated large turnout at her funeral symbolizes widespread admiration, despite the racial injustices she faced posthumously in her burial denial. McDaniel's legacy as a pioneering African American actress is acknowledged, alongside her remarkable courage amid personal and professional adversities.",
