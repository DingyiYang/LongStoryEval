Assisted by her spirited friend Mel and with guidance from her ghostly mother Fran, Angela navigates a mix of humor and supernatural events while investigating the murder. Early suspicion falls on Jenny Wallace, Chris's former lover, until she presents an alibi and provides insight into potentially suspicious activities by Simon Beckett, Chris's business associate.\nThe investigation reveals tensions within Chris's social circle, involving possible rivalries and hidden motives.
