        "overall_sum": "In 2199, Dr. Ophelia Bray joins a mission to Lyria 393-C as a psychologist responsible for the crew’s mental health. The mission soon spirals into chaos as alien forces threaten the team. Ophelia, haunted by her abusive family legacy, must balance her professional role with her internal struggles. An unknown contagion begins to spread, leading to suspicion and fear. Under Mission Commander Ethan Severin, the team fights to maintain unity. Suspicion of a corporate conspiracy surfaces when black particles resembling alien technology are found.\nAs the contagion's symptoms worsen, the crew heads toward ominous alien towers. Ophelia battles alien influences on her mind, confronting her inner demons and leaving behind her friend Liana to save the crew. After a tense return to their base, the psychological weight of Ophelia’s father manifests, challenging her to find self-trust.\nThe situation intensifies when Kate turns distrustful and conflicts arise, culminating in a confrontation where Ophelia sedates Kate after she shoots Ethan. Despite the danger, Ophelia ensures Kate’s preservation, managing to detach herself from her father’s violent legacy and choosing her own path. Ethan continues to guide the group with compassion, seeking coordination amidst escalating threats.\nFinally, Ophelia seizes control, leading the crew out of Lyria 393-C’s atmosphere, determined to save them without subjugating to alien influences or her family's legacy. Back on Resilience, the crew faces the future implications of their infection and the artifacts they carry. Their only option is cold sleep while Ophelia sends a message to her mother, using Pinnacle’s underhanded tactics against them, set with a contingency to leverage power back on Earth.\nUpon awakening eleven years later, Ophelia finds that the message sent had significant impacts—her sister Dulcie informs her that it led to Pinnacle’s leadership shake-up. Although the alien threat is neutralized, Ophelia realizes this situation will likely be exploited somehow. With Ethan by her side, Ophelia emerges, ready to assert her own agency in whatever battles lie ahead.",
