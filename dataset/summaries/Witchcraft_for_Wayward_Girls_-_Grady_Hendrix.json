        "overall_sum": "At the Home for Unwed Mothers in Florida, fifteen-year-old Fern (later Neva) grapples with the oppressive rule of Miss Wellwood. Forming vital bonds with fellow residents like Holly and Zinnia, these girls navigate societal expectations, internal dilemmas, and power struggles, highlighted by elements of mysticism and systemic constraints. Holly's traumatic past mobilizes the group's protective instincts, while Zinnia serves as a pragmatic force, emphasizing resilience.\nFern confronts societal pressures and internal conflict when delivering her daughter, Charlie Brown, under duress. Haunted by the inevitable feeling of loss, Fern, Zinnia, and Holly plot a daring escape from their oppressive surroundings. Led by Zinnia's resourcefulness, they seek refuge with allies like Hagar and Miriam, epitomizing a blend of practical and mystical aid. Holly gives birth safely, with mutual support bolstering their unity and empowerment.\nDespite hopes for safety, plans collapse under police intervention. Miss Wellwood underscores societal power dynamics, and Fern's involvement in the escape invites legal scrutiny. Nevertheless, themes of courage and resistance proliferate as the girls challenge the oppressive system. Fern returns to Wellwood, confronting a deepening realization of cyclic suffering endured by her peers. An interaction with Reverend Jerry, a sinister figure from Holly's past, further confirms their limited power.\nIn a pivotal moment, Fern's inner turmoil culminates in a supernatural act, invoking a storm to embody her rage and agency. Amidst the chaos, witches arise as a symbol of resistance, bolstering Fern's demand for autonomy. Holly's selflessness leads the witches to reevaluate tradition, choosing life and autonomy over lineage. This choice initiates a shift toward mercy and compassion, marking Fern's unexpected path toward freedom.\nThe narrative threads converge in the epilogue, where Neva, after fifty-four years, confronts her past by learning that Charlie is searching for her. This revelation prompts introspection, reflection on societal changes, and a commitment to advocacy as a doula. Neva reconnects with Rose, now living with her family in a women's community, and gains perspective on her own journey.\nEncouraged by her friends Rose and Zinnia, Neva resolves to call Charlie, confronting her long-held guilt and societal expectations. In an emotional phone conversation, she tells Charlie about her coerced surrender, catalyzing a transformative shift that bridges her past with present healing. Neva's journey embodies resilience, acceptance, and the courage to reclaim her narrative, ready to forge a new connection with her daughter.",
