        "overall_sum": "Lia Kurinava, a former novice of the Nin-Anna convent, finds herself embroiled in the divine-political complexities of Runakhia. As Queen Imvada plans her engagement to Araunn, Lia discovers latent sorcery powers and navigates thorny moral landscapes, notably through her connections with Ruven, a spectral sorcerer, and Mor-Iva, a goddess. Lia's actions of freeing people from coerced sainthood make her a controversial figure challenging divine norms, with the grim fates of saints like Miryakhel and Anabekha illustrating the human toll of divine whims.\nLia's conflict escalates, prompting Mor-Iva to reconsider her disdain toward human frailty. Her growing magical influence garners the prime minister's secret support against Imvada's tyranny, trapping her in an act of high treason. With Araunn's attempt to mitigate Imvada's plots perceived as betrayal, Lia is imprisoned. Labeled a traitor, she faces being sacrificed in a historic rite promising power to the royal lineage.\nIn her cell, Ruven's spectral help provides Lia clarity. She confesses to Araunn and Varia, sealing her fate for the Great Sacrifice. Varia, questioning Imvada's scale of ambition, takes charge after witnessing her mother's machinations. As the rite unfolds, Araunn's unexpected aid results in his mortal wounding by Imvada, whom Varia then kills, inheriting immense power.\nHarnessing sorcery and divine deals, Lia and Ruven confront divine realms, aiming to reshape the gods, granting them mortality. Tragically, Ruven's bond with Lia severs, returning him to vulnerable mortality and entombment. Seeking Varia's reluctant help, Lia sets out to save Ruven, confronting her fears as she battles time to save their converging destinies.\nReaching the mausoleum, Lia initially doubts Mor-Iva's guidance, fearing Ruven's permanence in death. A desperate pounding within the tomb reignites her resolve, and despite physical limitations, Mor-Iva reminds Lia of her power. She summons divine might to crumble the tomb, freeing Ruven. Riven by guilt for Ruven's harrowing experience, she apologizes, revealing her accidental intervention that ensures Ruven's resurrection—a miraculous act he appreciates as either accident or grace.\nLia and Ruven reflect on events, with Lia deciding against a nunnery life, opting instead to heal and support Queen Varia's rule and a kinder future, engaging gods and mortals alike. Ruven, renouncing any intent to dismantle the royal family, joins Lia, marking a transformation for both as they exit the graveyard into an altered world. This commitment to mutual growth and a harmonious existence challenges the once-silent gods to heed Lia's proclamation that love and duty can coexist, aiming to forge a compassionate realm.",
