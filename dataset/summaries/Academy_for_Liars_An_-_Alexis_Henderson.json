Initially bound by Drayton's coercive grip, Lennon discovers the true purpose of her talents: to maintain the campus's magical boundaries that hinge upon William, the frail chancellor's, survival. Faced with his impending death, she confronts the looming threat of being trapped in his role as a perpetuator of Drayton's sinister legacy.\nAs tensions heighten, Lennon finds both betrayal and loyalty among her friends. Notably, Blaine transitions from self-serving behavior to becoming a steadfast ally. Lennon's escape prompts dangerous entanglements, unraveling Drayton's dark influences further, exacerbated by her conflict with Nadine. Misunderstandings and resulting tragedies compound Lennon's feelings of isolation and burden.\nAmidst turmoil, Drayton collapses—highlighting Lennon's pivotal struggle for agency. Lennon's resistance against Eileen, who seeks to exploit her abilities, culminates in a climactic face-off. Dante's sacrificial actions lend Lennon the crucial support needed to wield her powers effectively, ultimately ensuring Drayton's survival. His death scars Lennon deeply, but her determination to reforge her own destiny and protect the students prevails.\nEmerging as a reluctant leader, Lennon ruthlessly deposes corrupt faculty members, restructuring the school in her likeness. Despite assuming the chancellorship, she withdraws from active involvement, retreating to Dante's house and grappling with grief. Her isolation grows as she contemplates the scope of her powers and the future shaped by her choices.\nDuring Christmas, concerned friends visit Lennon, alleviating her pervasive loneliness, yet their visit underscores her lingering resentment and despair over Dante's ultimate fate. Driven by guilt and hope, Lennon obsessively delves into Dante's past, using her powers to investigate pivotal memories linked to his disappearance.\nAfter a series of taxing attempts, Lennon reaches Dante in a critical moment from his childhood. Their encounter is emotionally charged, characterized by an acceptance of fate and shared love. Dante's choice to return to the present—and Lennon's demonstrated acceptance of his autonomy—result in his survival and their reunion, both characters poised for healing and new beginnings.",
