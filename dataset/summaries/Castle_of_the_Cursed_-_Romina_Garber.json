        "overall_sum": "Estela Amador survives the notorious Subway 25 incident and is drawn to Castillo Brálaga in Oscuro, Spain, uncovering her family's supernatural secrets. Her journey exposes her to a twin sister, Antonela, trapped by dark magic inflicted by their uncle Teo. Estela's quest transforms into a precarious mission to unravel the mysteries surrounding her, halt Antonela’s schemes, and confront Teo's manipulations, deeply intertwined with their magical ancestry and the tragic accident.\nThe castle is alive with the Brálaga family’s magic, particularly regarding la Sombra. Estela forms an alliance with Sebastián, a shadow beast and prince of the Bleeders. Their initially wary relationship blossoms into unwavering devotion. The castle plays host to Antonela, who aims to reclaim her physical form by manipulating the magic binding it. Estela delves deep into her ancestry’s sorcery to stop Antonela's plans, leading her to discover a significant Book foreshadowing a familial confrontation.\nAs Antonela’s power and schemes grow more dangerous, weaving intricate plots to regain form and power, Estela grapples with moral dilemmas, especially around family loyalties and the superstitions of Oscuro concerning la Sombra. These confrontations with her past and familial trauma fuel Estela’s resolve, culminating in a decisive clash with Antonela and Teo's manipulations.\nEstela evolves from a lone survivor into a potent force against Oscuro’s mystical dangers. Her union with Sebastián uncovers deeper family truths that empower their struggle. Compassion clashes with Antonela's thirst for power, and Estela’s resolve becomes essential for healing fractured family bonds. Guided by spectral revelations, Estela gears up to trap Antonela, leading them into the fateful purple room where worlds converge.\nWithin this climax, Estela’s apparent vulnerability serves her plan. As Antonela attempts possession, Estela discovers an unexpected transformation, turning into purple smoke, symbolizing hope. Ultimately, Estela successfully traps Antonela’s essence within a photograph, halting her ambitions but not destroying her spirit—holding hope for a future reunion.\nThirteen months later, Estela and Sebastián settle into a new dynamic. Sebastián remains confined to the castle but adapts with renewed purpose. Estela has begun taking medical strides, maintaining her aunt’s practice while hunting down criminals to satiate Sebastián’s dark hunger. Their relationship weaves love and duty as Estela continually seeks ways to unbind Sebastián fully and reconcile Antonela's fate.",
