Her union with her half-brother Thutmose creates tension, as her unwanted pregnancy challenges her independence. As a high priestess, Neferura strives to shield her loved ones from Thutmose's growing ambitions. The betrayal surrounding her friend Iset’s family intensifies as Iset is captured and dies following a rescue attempt led by Neferura. Iset's last wish to protect her child Neferu spurs Neferura to greater resolve.\nNeferura contends with palace dynamics, including Satiah's marriage to Thutmose. She strategically claims her child is male to secure her standing and keep Thutmose at bay. Hathor, an enigmatic ally, supports Neferura through secretive actions, including the spread of disinformation about Khui’s purported death. As Neferura faces premature labor, emotional bonds with Benerib and others offer some comfort amidst the tensions. A deep focus on friendship showcases the influence of Neferura’s past, including Meri's death during childbirth, heightening her fears as her own labor nears.\nPolitical dangers persist, requiring Neferura and Hathor to employ a range of tactics to protect their interests. In a climactic moment, Neferura grapples with the daunting realities of childbirth and her role as the god's wife, highlighting the precarious balance of power and survival in Kemet.\nThe epilogue reveals a more stable future. Hathor visits Senenmut, who, together with Neferura, now Amunet, enjoys a more peaceful life away from the palace. A child named Amenemhat has been taken in by the new queen Satiah. Reflecting on the past, Hathor considers settling down in the cottage, embodying a rare opportunity for personal tranquility after years devoted to intrigue and manipulation to secure the kingdom's future.",
