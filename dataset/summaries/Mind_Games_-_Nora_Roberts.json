        "overall_sum": "In Redbud Hollow, Kentucky, Thea Fox, a psychic and game designer, balances the trauma from her parents' murder by Ray Riggs, a powerful psychic with an obsession with her. She finds solace in her family—her caring grandmother Lucy and protective brother Rem—and strives to rebuild her life in this peaceful setting. Tyler Brennan, a former rock star and single father, moves to the town seeking stability for himself and his son, Bray. Tyler and Thea form a bond over shared experiences, complicated initially by misunderstandings regarding Thea's psychic abilities. Tyler comes to terms with the true burden of Thea’s psychic connection to Riggs, which affects her deeply, exemplified by a panic attack resulting from Riggs’s torment.\nThea demonstrates resolve and bravery when she uses her psychic abilities to help Nadine, a fellow community member, find her missing daughter, Adalaide. This act reaffirms her strength and willingness to use her gift positively. The shared experience strengthens her bond with Tyler, leading to a commitment to a shared future. Despite their growing relationship, Thea remains haunted by Riggs’s influence. Determined to break this hold, she decides to confront him in prison directly, despite concerns from her family that this could empower Riggs.\nSupported by Ty, Thea visits Riggs at Red Onion State Prison in Virginia. She prepares meticulously for the encounter, drawing strength from her community and dressing in a manner reminiscent of her mother to unsettle Riggs. During a mentally intense showdown in the prison, Thea uses her psychic power to lead Riggs through his life’s pivotal moments, highlighting his consistently harmful choices. This causes him to experience mental and physical pain, culminating in a stroke. Thea effectively imprisons what's left of Riggs's mind, ensuring he can never threaten her again.\nAfterward, Thea emerges victorious, supported by Ty, who offers steadfast love and understanding. As they leave the prison, Ty reveals a song he wrote for Thea, cementing their relationship further. They plan a future together, integrating their lives and families, with visions of expanding their family and Tyler’s desire to revive his music career. The segment concludes with a sense of hope and new beginnings as Thea and Ty look forward to building a life together.",
