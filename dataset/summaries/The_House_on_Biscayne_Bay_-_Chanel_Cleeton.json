        "overall_sum": "Carmen Acosta resides at the Marbrisa estate driven by the need to uncover the truth behind her sister Carolina’s murder. She navigates a complex web of family secrets and historical tragedies tied to the estate. Carmen's investigation is complicated by family dynamics, particularly with her brother-in-law Asher Wyatt and Detective Pierce, who investigates Marbrisa’s mysteries. Marbrisa’s haunting history is marked by mysterious deaths, including Anna Barnes, who is revealed to still be alive. Anna and Robert Barnes' tumultuous relationship and the murky fate of Lenora Watson are central to the story’s past. At Marbrisa, Carmen delves into these legacies, with Nathaniel Hayes, an investigator. Despite initial tensions, they form an alliance.\nUnveiling connections between the past and present tragedies of the estate reveals Mrs. Morrison, the housekeeper, as a source of insight. She discloses Robert's extramarital affairs and Anna Barnes’ plan to escape. Robert’s betrayals and Lenora's death underpin Marbrisa's tragic lineage. In a modern twist, Carmen discovers a knife linked to her sister’s murder in Asher’s car, heightening suspicions and urgency.\nIn a dramatic climax, during a storm-induced power outage, Carmen and Nathaniel find Mrs. Morrison injured, but alive, in Carmen's room. They face George, who reveals himself as the murderer, driven by claims to Marbrisa as his birthright. He confesses to killing Carolina and framing Asher. Carmen bravely defends herself, stabbing George, bringing his threat—and Marbrisa’s mysteries—to an end.\nThe epilogue provides reflective closure. Anna Barnes, once presumed dead, visits Marbrisa with Michael Harrison, the gardener who helped her escape. They face memories and tragedies tied to the estate, making peace with their decisions. Anna’s return to Marbrisa is significant; her character offers a bridge between past and present, reconciliation of history as Marbrisa is transformed into a hospital. Carmen, now connected to Marbrisa’s future, also plays a pivotal role in this transition. Michael and Anna leave Marbrisa, their goodbyes a metaphorical release from the past’s burdens. Marbrisa, a once-grand estate shrouded in secrets, now ushers hope and healing for the future.",
