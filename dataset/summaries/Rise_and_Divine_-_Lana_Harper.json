        "overall_sum": "In Thistle Grove, the annual Cavalcade festival is overshadowed by impending chaos as Chernobog, a dark deity, emerges as a threat. Daria Avramov, an exorcist witch deeply tied to the town’s mystical heritage, becomes involved in a cosmic struggle after her mother's death. As she navigates personal and familial issues, the Avramov clan, led by Elena, intensifies their defenses against supernatural threats.\nMaya, revealed to be the vessel for the goddess Belisama, plays a pivotal role in the escalating conflict. Belisama and Chernobog stand as cosmic dualities, with Chernobog representing chaos. The situation worsens when Wynter, a novice witch, summons Chernobog using stolen herbs, heightening the town's peril. Following her expulsion by Elena, Daria investigates deeper into the divine conflict, realizing Belisama’s significant essence within Maya.\nThe confrontation reaches its peak at Castle Camelot, where Daria and other necromancers, urged by the goddess through Maya, face Chernobog in a mystical palace of blizzard-stone. Daria, in a bold move, cleverly entraps and absorbs Chernobog’s divine essence, dissolving his presence along with the palace. This decision plunges her into a near-resigned state, trapped on the other side of the veil, unable to return.\nDuring Daria’s entrapment, a majestic heart tree from Thorn orchards wraps around her, symbolizing a gratitude spirit helping her return to Thistle Grove. She wakes in her partner Ivy’s comforting presence, learning about the rescue orchestrated by witches like Genevieve and entire families. The strategy involves harnessing the heart tree’s power and collective empathy, showcasing the strengths in unity and divine versus mundane intervention.\nReturning to Thistle Grove, Daria re-emerges with a renewed sense of connection to the town’s magic and reassured in her relationship with Ivy. Despite the loss of her devil-eating powers—sacrificed in defeating Chernobog—she embraces the opportunity to build a new identity. The closing Sabbat sees witches gathering at Lady’s Lake for a ritual. An emotional confrontation with Belisama underscores Daria’s choices and resolve, as she declines an offer to regain lost powers, opting to embrace a new life’s quieter joys.\nThe ritual culminates in a reenactment of Thistle Grove's founding. Belisama, through Maya, thanks the witches before departing; it reveals Maya's true identity as Teyana, a traveling nurse. As the townsfolk and Teyana remain connected to the magical essence of Thistle Grove, Daria and Ivy share a heartfelt moment, contemplating a future together in their fairy-tale-like town.",
