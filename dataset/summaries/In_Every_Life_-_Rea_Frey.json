Harper balances Ben's care with her growing career, drawing strength from loved ones like Wren and Jenna. Her life experiences a shift during a spontaneous full moon ritual that temporarily transports her to an alternate reality where she is a successful gallery owner without Ben.\nBack in her reality, Harper chooses to stay present despite the alternate reality's temptation of seeing Ben healthy. She engages fully in life with Ben, embracing her artistic career and resolving to complete an art show tribute to him. As Ben’s condition worsens, Harper’s resilience is tested, but she remains committed, finding solace in shared moments and memories.\nThe narrative climaxes during Harper's art show, a tribute to Ben. Friends, family, and colleagues gather, and with emotional speeches, Harper and Ben acknowledge the profound impact of their love. Harper’s surprise pregnancy offers a poignant symbol of hope and continuation, reinvigorating their determination against Ben’s illness. Ben holds onto life long enough to meet his son, passing peaceful and content.\nThe epilogue, set years later, finds Harper living in Dumbo, New York, with her son, Benjamin Jr. Ben's memory is preserved through the successful art show tour, now concluding at Rita Clementine’s gallery. Harper reflects on her growth and past decisions, after learning from Rita that her work had been valued all along, but a misunderstanding had led to missed opportunities.
