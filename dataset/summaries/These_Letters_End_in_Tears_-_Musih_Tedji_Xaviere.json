        "overall_sum": "In Cameroon, the emotionally resilient university lecturer Bessem embarks on a journey toward personal authenticity amid societal constraints, driven by the memory of Fatima (Fati), whose mysterious disappearance and tragic fate deeply affect her. Their defiant love navigates societal scrutiny, marked by a symbolic union beneath a university baobab. Confronted with familial and societal challenges, Bessem’s tense relations with friends and partners, including Jamal and Audrey, highlight contrasts in societal acceptance.\nBessem is drawn into a labyrinth of fear and truth surrounding Fati’s disappearance, especially as Mahamadou, Fati’s brother and a religious figure, embodies menacing spiritual authority. The complex revelations from Shari, Mahamadou’s wife, eventually confirm that Fati was killed by Mahamadou and secretly buried. Despite seeking police intervention, Bessem’s righteous pursuit is thwarted by Mahamadou's manipulative charm and social standing.\nIn seeking justice and closure, Bessem struggles with substance abuse and an emotional confrontation with Mahamadou, culminating in her hospitalization. Supported by her friends, she confronts the bleak reality of legal impotence. The weight of evidence, societal influence, and personal loss frames Bessem’s journey as a reflection on power, love, identity, and the intolerant structures imposed by society.\nIn the subsequent epilogue, Bessem finds herself at an airport with items that belonged to Fati, reflecting on her fight for Fati’s memory and her emotional battle with a bottomless sadness. Her experiences prompt a social media exposé against Mahamadou, meant to challenge his authority and encourage societal reflection on violence against love. Despite her unresolved grief and the need to flee for her safety and Jamal’s, Bessem envisions a future where she can gaze upon it with hope and carries the knowledge of having fiercely loved and fought for Fati's memory.",
