Driven by the death of Josie Jonson, Mike pursues Paul Renaud, a fugitive and former Special Services member, and his dangerously unstable daughter, Chloé. Armed with a cryptic map from Chloé, Mike teams up with bounty hunter Ammon Pratt, but their alliance is short-lived as Pratt surrenders, leaving Mike to cross into Canada alone.\nAmidst a confrontation with Canadian Border Services officers, Mike’s resilience is tested during a betrayal involving officers Nadeau and Proulx. After shooting Proulx, Mike saves Nadeau, learning crucial secrets that deepen the mystery around Chloé’s violence. Chloé demonstrates her threat level by firing upon Mike, forcing him across the border to prevent further chaos.\nDespite legal perils, Mike proceeds, signaling intentions to his partner Stacey and alerting authorities.

Counsel from Charley provides a buffer against ensuing chaos, informing him of the Stombaughs’ arrest thanks to Mike’s evidence of their criminal involvement. Reflecting on Chloé’s survival, Mike contemplates child evilness, recognizing institutionalization as her likely path.\nAmidst professional turmoil predicting investigations into his Maine conduct, Mike shares vulnerability regarding his identity's core with Stacey. Their journey, marked by emotional truths, culminates in personal revelation when Stacey reveals her pregnancy, heralding new familial responsibilities amid ongoing external challenges.
