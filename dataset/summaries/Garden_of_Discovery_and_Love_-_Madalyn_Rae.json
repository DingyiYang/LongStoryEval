Conflicts arise involving her estranged mother, Tammy, who leads a faction of hybrid lycans with intentions rooted in past grudges linked to an ancient cult. Amelia and her allies uncover a conspiracy in the Everglades, further intensifying these disputes. Back in New Orleans, Amelia wrestles with an overwhelming bloodlust, hinting at untapped potential within her vampire nature.
