Iccadora, seeking vengeance for the death of her friend Tecca, aims to overthrow Hattie's reign by using powerful magic contained in the Ledger—a tool that facilitates a dangerous exchange of sanity for divine power. As she confronts the power dynamics that control her world, Iccadora faces an internal battle against the dark currents of magic threatening to consume her.\nCarousel, caught between her past affections for Iccadora and her duty to Hattie, faces immense internal conflict. Her complex relationship with Iccadora is deeply rooted in a shared history marked by affection, rivalry, and betrayal. Carousel finds herself increasingly drawn to Hattie’s formidable power, complicating her loyalties and propelling her toward discovering deeper truths about her magical heritage. She hesitates in a critical moment with Icca, revealing the depth of her internal struggle.\nHattie, who rose to power after her mother Delcorta's mysterious death, manages the complexities of leadership and the supernatural threats that abound. Her mastery of saints—a group of magically-gifted individuals—demonstrates her strategic cunning. A significant revelation about her origin is unveiled, hinting that Hattie is the result of a soul-fusion experiment by her mother, aiming to preserve their family lineage and strength, adding depth to her multifaceted character. Ultimately, Hattie embraces her role as the ruler and goddess-like figure in Wonderland.\nAgainst this intricate backdrop lies the legacy of Hattie's ancestor, King Min Titus Kkul, whose reckless endeavors unleashed chaos and celestial curses upon Isanghan. Entries in Hattie’s diaries unravel this history, exposing cursed legacies interwoven between influential families, thereby enmeshing Icca, Carousel, and Hattie in an unbreakable web of destiny. Wonderland continues to watch their struggles, a mystical presence that influences their actions.\nDuring the intense encounter in the vicinity of Petra Ward's palace, Iccadora and Carousel confront the tension in their relationship. Icca's venture into using Min Titus’s magic through the Ledger exposes her to an overwhelming vision of Wonderland, revealing the unbridled power of her lineage. This drives her to confront Carousel and Kai, challenging their bonds and unveiling deep-rooted conflicts.\nHattie’s manipulation transforms Carousel into a terrifying creature during a church confrontation, nearly bringing a tragic end to Iccadora. The decisive use of her Shadow magic pulls them into Wonderland, confronting each with their deepest fears and desires. Hattie’s new form displays an unparalleled connection to both her magic and the elemental forces of Wonderland, underscoring her transformation into something beyond human. Meanwhile, Carousel emerges from Hattie’s influence, and the trio’s confrontation highlights the enduring emotional ties and unresolved tensions between them.\nCarousel, having regained her sense of self, contends with her complex emotions, including guilt for past actions and loyalty to Hattie. Iccadora, skilled yet conflicted, remains indecisive about her plans for Carousel as she navigates a landscape filled with potent magic and potential redemption. Hattie acknowledges her own power, embracing her identity as the Queen of the Saints and understanding her role in Wonderland. Her demand for more Jabberwockies signals her intent to further control the supernatural hierarchy.\nHattie’s introspective reflections convey her acceptance of her nature, her connections with magic, and the ultimate realization that her dominion over her environment is complete. Wonderland’s influence remains a significant force in their lives, its mysteries both a source of danger and an arena for the witches’ self-discovery.",
