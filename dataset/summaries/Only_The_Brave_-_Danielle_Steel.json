Inspired by his bravery, she joins the French Resistance, balancing her roles as a nurse and a nun at St. Joseph's Hospital. Her mission to help Jewish children escape Nazi persecution brings constant danger, working alongside allies like Mother Regina. When her significant other, Claus, is captured, Sophia becomes more resolute.\nDuring the war, she endures imprisonment at Ravensbrück, forming deep bonds with inmates like Jo, Hedi, and Tamar. Covertly aided by SS Lieutenant Hans Mahler, who questions his loyalties, she orchestrates a daring escape to safety. At the St. Blaise Convent, she assumes a new identity assisted by Max, a Resistance contact. Her friends scatter—Jo moves to France, Brigitte to Munich, Hedi to Lisbon—while Sophia nurtures an injured American airman, Ted Blake, fostering a profound connection.\nBy Chapter 14, Sophia and Ted share their wartime experiences just before his departure, strengthening their bond. Despite her commitment as a nun, Ted hopes for a future reunion following the war. As World War II progresses, Sophia remains at St. Blaise, caring for children and buoyed by Allied progress reported through a local radio.\nAfter Europe is liberated in May 1945, Sophia resolves to return to a war-torn Berlin by June 1945, determined to aid its recovery. She discovers the abandoned convent, encountering Charlie, the handyman. Despite the Sisters of Mercy's relocation due to bombings, Sophia decides to stay, working to transform the convent into a refuge for displaced women. Help from her sister Theresa and her husband Heinrich strengthens her resolve and resources.\nIn this critical chapter, Ted visits, hoping Sophia might reconsider her monastic life; initially, she remains committed. However, Sophia’s resolve is shaken after her unsatisfying encounter with Ted, her inner conflict growing. A sign comes when she sees a red bird, which provides her the clarity to realize her true desires: a life with Ted. She rushes to catch Ted at the train station, dressed in an uncharacteristic summer dress, signaling her departure from her nun’s life. Their emotional reunion confirms to Sophia that Ted is her intended future, a sign and opportunity for the life she was meant to lead.",
