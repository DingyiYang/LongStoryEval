        "overall_sum": "Helen Zhang, an accomplished writer, navigates the complexities of her professional success and unresolved personal emotions rooted in her family's cultural expectations. Her story intertwines with Grant Shepard, a charismatic screenwriter linked to Helen through unresolved feelings and the tragic death of Helen’s sister, Michelle.\nHelen initially returns to her hometown to confront old conflicts and seek reconciliation with her family, particularly focusing on bridging gaps with her parents. Staying in an unfamiliar Airbnb, she reflects on her shift from novelist to showrunner, wrestling with the balance between her professional success and personal satisfaction amidst her sister's shadow and her tumultuous relationship with Grant.\nFour months later, back in LA for her TV series premiere, Helen wrestles with inner turmoil and the specter of Grant's presence. Amidst the glamour, her thoughts frequently return to him and their unspoken connection. Grant also grapples internally, torn between attending the premiere and keeping his distance, ultimately choosing solitude.\nPost-premiere, Helen delves into a personal project, writing unsent letters to Michelle. By sharing this manuscript, titled \"Letters You’ll Never Read,\" with her agent and sending it to Grant, she bravely confronts her fears and the barriers her grief has created.\nIn a pivotal, late-night reunion at the hotel, stirred by Helen's manuscript, Grant confronts Helen about her feelings. Their emotionally charged encounter results in confessions of love and a commitment to a future together. A powerful earthquake the next morning symbolizes upheaval yet renewal in their relationship. The tremors mark a new start as both discover strength in their bond.\nThe narrative transitions to Helen's declaration to her parents about her decision to move to LA with Grant, prompting familial skepticism. Nevertheless, a sense of newfound self-assurance permeates Helen’s resolve.\nLater on, Grant proposes casually yet earnestly to Helen at the New York Public Library, a place meaningful for both. Despite Helen’s mixed familial reception, their love deepens as they navigate Helen's challenging family dynamics and cultural expectations. They wed on a picturesque sheep farm in Ireland amidst friends and family, embracing a fresh beginning.\nHelen’s reflections on their wedding day encapsulate the story’s themes—healing from the past, familial reconciliation, and embracing love's multifaceted journey. Together, Helen and Grant overcome obstacles, honoring Michelle’s memory while forging their own path toward happiness.",
