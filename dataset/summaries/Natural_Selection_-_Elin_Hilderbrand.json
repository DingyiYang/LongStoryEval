She is scrolling through Instagram, reflecting on JP's suggestion to take a break from social media during their upcoming trip to the Galápagos Archipelago. JP, a seemingly perfect \"nice guy\" from the Midwest, gets a mysterious call from a gate agent. After taking the call, he informs Sophia that he has to leave due to an incident with his son, Briar, forgetting to give details. \nSophia is left to embark on the trip alone, feeling abandoned and uncertain. Despite Sophia's initial reluctance regarding the Galápagos trip due to its less tropical nature, she considers it a significant step forward in her relationship with JP, hoping for a future and maybe children with him. The trip, however, does not start as she imagined. She boards her flight, alone and anxious about the sudden turn of events, trying to understand JP’s abrupt departure and her own feelings of solitude.\nAs she acquaints herself with the rest of the passengers on the boat Dorado, she comes across various couples and individuals, each with distinct backgrounds and expectations. Sophia is assigned the \"Honeymoon Suite\" but swaps it with Kelly and Tucker, a couple of carefree firefighters, as she doesn't need a double bed now.\nThe initial setting on the boat in the Galápagos starkly contrasts Sophia's dream vacation, as it lacks the luxury she anticipated. Nevertheless, she begins to connect with fellow passengers like Wanda and Henry, a couple from Ohio marking their forty-sixth anniversary, and DeAndre and Grant, a fashionable couple from San Francisco. JP's camera remains with Sophia, suggesting a shared responsibility for capturing the experience he was meant to enjoy.\nThroughout these early experiences, Sophia grapples with the dynamics in her evolving relationship with JP, her own expectations of a vacation, and her feelings of being left out and left alone. She is caught between wanting to enjoy this unique experience and the uncertainties looming over her relationship with JP.",
