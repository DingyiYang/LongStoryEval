The couple opts for St. George's Chapel, an unconventional site reflecting a break from tradition, prioritizing intimacy and safety. Greeting guests themselves underscored this new approach, supported by family and friends who celebrate their unique path forward.\nDespite lingering mysteries, particularly around who might have removed crucial evidence from Jennie’s safe deposit box, Hugh and Jennie prioritize trust and progress.
