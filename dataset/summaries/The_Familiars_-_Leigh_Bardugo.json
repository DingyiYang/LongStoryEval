        "overall_sum": "Set in 16th-century Spain, the tale follows Luzia Cotado, a Jewish woman with magical talents, ensnared in the political and religious turmoil of the Inquisition era. Under the patronage of the ambitious Víctor de Paredes, her life takes a dramatic turn during a magical tournament led by the cunning Antonio Pérez. Pérez seeks power and disrupts the status quo but leaves Luzia vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft.\nAmidst the chaos, Luzia escapes into the woods with Santángel, an immortal mentor linked to the De Paredes lineage. Caring for his wounds, she confronts her aspirations and complex ties while enduring Víctor’s constant threats. In Madrid, Valentina, once allied with Luzia, navigates court intricacies to assert her independence, contemplating aiding Luzia at great personal risk. As plans for escape take shape, betrayal leads to the tragic death of Luzia’s aunt Hualit, a stark act of resistance against Víctor’s machinations. Captured, Luzia finds allies in Teoda and Neva, fellow prisoners plotting their breakout.\nSantángel, imprisoned, reflects on his past, his connections, and the possibility of liberating Luzia by severing ties with Víctor. Facing his own trial, he declares his heretical actions, hoping to trade his fate for Luzia’s survival. She aligns with Santángel’s plan to disrupt Víctor's intentions of binding her powers to his service, risking self-incrimination. Yet, courtroom politics allow Donadei’s maneuvering to influence proceedings, letting Luzia seize control of her destiny.\nAt their joint execution, Luzia embraces magic's power, choosing defiance and love over submission. Valentina, witnessing this, embraces personal transformation and autonomy, departing from traditional roles. In a dramatic twist, Luzia manipulates the flames to ensure her and Santángel’s “deaths,” freeing them from pursuit.\nRumors spread of no bodies among the ashes, attributed to their otherworldly nature. In secrecy, they flee to Valencia, reborn and unending, traveling through time without age, discovering new places. Separately, the narrative follows Valentina creating a vibrant community of artistic expression, confronting societal constraints, while Víctor succumbs to fear, plagued by hesitation and deterioration. His once unwavering confidence unravels, leaving him isolated and regretful.\nFortún Donadei, robbed of his magical prowess, attempts to reclaim past glory alongside Víctor, but their journey is stymied by Víctor’s mounting anxieties. Meanwhile, Santángel and Luzia, unaging and bound eternally, move through time, each city new, their past a legend they leave behind. The couple navigates a unique existence, Santángel’s daily resurrection renewed by Luzia’s enduring love, forever moving forward together.",
