        "overall_sum": "In a mystical New York City, Kierse, a gifted thief with the ability to nullify spells, partners with Graves, an enigmatic warlock and the Holly King, to maintain the magical balance. Their journey unfolds as they attempt to acquire the Spear of Lugh from the Men of Valor during a Winter Solstice Gala, amidst personal and supernatural challenges. As she trains with Graves, Kierse grapples with her past, including her enslavement by King Louis and her complex relationships, deepening her connection with Graves.\nThe mission leads them into a high-stakes infiltration of King Louis's party, where they aim to rescue Kierse's ex-girlfriend, Torra, and secure the spear. Tension mounts as King Louis seeks to exploit Kierse’s blood for invincibility. Utilizing the Spear, Kierse manages to fulfill her promise to Torra, leading to an intense escape illuminated by a revelation of Kierse's prophesied role.\nTheir escape uncovers additional layers, introducing Lorcan Flynn, the Druid leader and Oak King, who is interested in the magical artifacts, including Kierse’s spear. A confrontation reveals Kierse's Fae heritage, adding complexity to her relationship with Graves. Power struggles and shifting allegiances culminate in a magical explosion following Lorcan's attempted ascendance. As Kierse is overwhelmed by god magic, her allies, Graves, Gen, and Ethan, aid her in transferring the magic’s burden—a feat that strains but ultimately strengthens their bond.\nIn the decision for self-discovery, Kierse chooses to leave New York, urged by the need for knowledge of her identity, planning to visit Dublin’s Goblin Market. Despite Graves proposing she stay, Kierse is resolute in her quest, yet hopeful of returning one day. As she departs with Gen, the story shifts back to Graves.\nAlone in the aftermath of their separation, Graves reflects on his life without Kierse and the unresolved nature of his quest to complete a powerful spell requiring four magical artifacts. He contends with the disappointment of losing the objects during their conflict with Lorcan, along with Kierse’s departure, leaving him emotionally adrift yet resolute. \nDuring a bout of frustration, Graves receives a call from Laz, an old contact, who provides a promising lead on the cauldron—another of the artifacts he requires. Realizing the task's complexity, Graves acknowledges the need to enlist Kierse's unique skills once more, setting a new course in their intertwined paths.",
