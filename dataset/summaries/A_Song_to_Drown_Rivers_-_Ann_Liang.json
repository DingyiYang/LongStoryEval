Xishi navigates the perilous realm with meticulous strategic alliances. She allies with Lady Yu and Zhengdan for internal sabotage and uses Xiaomin as a covert informant. Xishi and her advisor, Fanli, share a deep bond, engendering mutual emotional and strategic reliance.\nAs the stakes heighten, Xishi relays critical intelligence to Yue, securing an impending invasion. Her machinations shift court dynamics, undermining prominent figures like General Ma and leading to Wu Zixu's suicide, a testament to escalating intrigue. Despite Fuchai's trust, Xishi remains Yue’s loyal agent, planning her return through secret messages with Fanli.\nDuring a canal celebration concealing Yue's invasion, Xishi escapes with Fuchai, only to reveal her true loyalties as Yue's forces close in. In a poignant moment, Fuchai entrusts Xishi with his life, marking both a strategic victory for Yue and a sorrowful transition for Xishi. Hailed a hero upon her return, Xishi is haunted by her actions, particularly Zhengdan's ultimate sacrifice. Zhengdan's mother confronts her, illuminating the widespread and personal cost of royal conflicts.\nSeeking respite and Fanli's companionship, Xishi sets for a riverside meeting. Yet, she’s betrayed by an agent carrying Goujian's mark, bound and drowned in the river. In her last moments, memories of Fanli's comfort and aspirations for relief resurface. Unbeknownst to Fanli, she watches him unravel with grief over her death.\nFanli's grief manifests violently, marked by guilt and a desperate wish for retribution against King Goujian. Attempts by Luyi to console him fail, pushing Fanli toward vengeance. However, a dream visit from Xishi redirects his fury toward thoughtful rebellion—using his abilities for societal improvements rather than assassination. Upon waking, Fanli resigns from Goujian’s court, refusing to serve while haunted by memories of Xishi.\nDriven by Xishi's wishes, Fanli refrains from outright violence but confronts Goujian one last time, resigning his ministerial duties. Meanwhile, Xishi's ghostly presence wreaks havoc on Goujian's conscience in his dreams. Fanli mournfully buries Xishi, persuading a young passerby to spread a tale of her everlasting life. In the underworld, Xishi waits through timeless darkness until finally, Fanli’s soul arrives, their reunion brightening the realm beyond life and death.",
