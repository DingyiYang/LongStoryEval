She introduces the \"See Yourself\" campaign, blending user content with advertiser material, which significantly raises FitPick's profile. During this time, she forms a connection with the CTO, Damien Scott, and grows closer to Austin and Bram, her supportive coworkers. The success, however, is marred by controversy when influencer Aisha Monroe's retouched photographs spark backlash, drawing scrutiny from journalist Rebecca Stiles.\nFaced with the controversy, Zoe takes a leave of absence. During this period, she becomes aware of Bill Lawrence, FitPick's CEO, and his unethical practices affecting the company's culture. Determined to counter Bill's manipulative strategies, Zoe sets out to gain the support of Keira White, a board member. The situation escalates when Tristan, Zoe's source, refuses to allow the use of emails proving Bill's ethical misconduct. Despite this setback, Zoe receives a reassuring call from Lillian Mariko, FitPick's COO, who manages to schedule a meeting with Keira.\nAt the meeting, Keira empathizes but warns of the challenges of ousting Bill due to support from questionable board members. Nevertheless, her involvement gives Zoe and Lillian hope. Outside of work, Zoe reconciles with Damien. Both express their mutual feelings, setting the stage for a developing romantic relationship.\nZoe's journey illustrates her resilience as she navigates challenges in both her professional and personal life, bolstered by allies like Lillian, Bernadette, Austin, Bram, and Damien. As challenges persist, Rebecca Stiles publishes an article revealing Bill's misconduct, leading to his ousting. This revelation vindicates Zoe and Lillian's concerns. Zoe is promoted to chief operating officer, and the new leadership helps stabilize FitPick. Damien leaves FitPick to focus on his writing, while Austin and Bram take on significant roles in the company.\nThree months later, Zoe prepares for a fashion conference where she supports her CEO, Lillian, emphasizing visions of leadership and growth. Their relationship reflects Zoe's development from feeling out of place to feeling confident and integral at FitPick.",
