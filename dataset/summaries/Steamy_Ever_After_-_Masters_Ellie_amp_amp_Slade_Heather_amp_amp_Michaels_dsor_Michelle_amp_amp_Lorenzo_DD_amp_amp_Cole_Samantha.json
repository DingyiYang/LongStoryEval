        "overall_sum": "Abby Knight, a former family physician escaping an abusive relationship, starts anew in Peace Springs, a town that promises sanctuary and healing. Her journey begins with a snowstorm, where she meets Drake, a mysterious but kind local rancher with a military past. Abby temporarily stays with Bert, a community-centric llama rancher, as she steps into her responsibilities at a medical practice left behind by her terminally ill uncle, Pete. In Peace Springs, Abby finds support from Sara, the clinic's manager, and begins to feel integrated into the tight-knit community that stands in stark contrast to the shadows of her past, marked by Scott, her abusive ex-partner.\nAbby's transition is punctuated by unsettling acts of vandalism, hinting at unresolved threats in her new town. Nonetheless, her growing relationship with Drake provides her emotional security as they bond over shared experiences and explore the dynamics of mutual healing. Drake, too, reveals his vulnerabilities, including the tragic loss of his wife and unborn child, adding depth to his nurturing nature. Abby flourishes under his protective presence, and as they explore her inherited land, a shared vision emerges, symbolizing both physical and emotional refuge. A test of Abby's trust occurs when past trauma resurfaces, but sharing her vulnerabilities with Drake strengthens their bond.\nScott's eventual confrontation brings past traumas into the present danger, but Drake's timely intervention underscores his deep commitment to Abby's safety and well-being. After Scott's arrest, Abby's physical injuries, though severe, are tended to, allowing her to once again find strength and resilience in Peace Springs. As she recovers, Abby's narrative merges with that of Peyton Becker, another woman healing from grief, further emphasizing themes of family and redemption. Abby's growing community support and burgeoning connections provide her with the empowerment needed to transcend her fears, constructing a new hopeful future with Drake as they both heal.\nThe story reaches its poignant conclusion as Abby cares for her dying uncle, Pete, embodying the role of caregiver and family stalwart. After Pete's passing, Abby is enveloped by the community's love and support, particularly through Drake, who never leaves her side. His unwavering presence culminates in a surprising and heartfelt marriage proposal, symbolizing the culmination of their healing journey and the promise of a loving future together. Abby's acceptance signifies more than just a personal triumph over abuse; it reflects her integration into Peace Springs, where she has found a true home encompassed by love, friendship, and safety.",
