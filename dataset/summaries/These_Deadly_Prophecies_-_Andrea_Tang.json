        "overall_sum": "Following Sorcerer Julian Solomon's murder and the prophecy hinting at treachery by a close confidant, young apprentice Tabatha Zeng dives into a world laden with magic and family secrets. As the heir chosen by Julian, she reluctantly becomes entangled in the Solomon family's tribulations, marked by sorcerous feuds and Detective Elena Chang's investigation focusing on Rowena Solomon. Tabatha, along with Julian’s son Callum, delves into the Solomon legacy, uncovering betrayals and the murders of prophetic sorcerers, including Hester O'Riley.\nAs family tensions rise and suspicions grow, Callum confesses to these murders to protect his mother, yet Tabatha doubts his culpability. Felix Solomon’s timely intervention against a supernatural threat sheds light on a deeper involvement, exonerating Callum, and adding layers to the familial intrigue unraveling at Solomon Manor. Felix takes the mantle of protector, employing kinetic magic while facing familial deception alongside Tabatha.\nCirce Solomon, originally underestimated, reveals her desperate use of illusion magic in impersonating Callum to falsely implicate him and her unintentional creation of a deadly entity representative of her inner turmoil. Under the guise of the shadow creature, Circe's yearning for acceptance spirals into chaos. Confronted by her family and Tabatha, she ultimately comes to terms with her actions, dismantling the creature by giving up magic she had mimicked, an act of self-acceptance and responsibility for the chaos she inadvertently begot.\nAs the shadows settle, the Solomon family, marked by trials both sorcerous and familial, begins to navigate a path toward healing. Circe starts therapy, embarking on redemption, while Callum deals with familial betrayal and begins introspection on his role in his father's prophecy and his life. Through it all, Tabatha exemplifies resilience, learning to perceive the truths within prophecy magic beyond mere predictions.\nIn a contemplative close, Tabatha and Callum discuss destiny's malleability and the potential of living one's prophecy with agency. As they forge their path, the future remains an uncharted prophecy of choice, shaped by love, forgiveness, and the courage to face one's fears and faults, seeking redemption and understanding amid a legacy of magic and mystery.",
