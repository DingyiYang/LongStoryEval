        "overall_sum": "In *Gar Nasim*, Deka embarks on a journey to liberate Otera from the tyrannical rule of the Gilded Ones, an oppressive pantheon maintaining strict control over the land. Her quest involves retrieving her kelai, a core part of her divine powers, which is both vital to her personal awakening and instrumental in the broader rebellion against divine oppression. She joins forces with diverse allies, notably the cunning White Hands and her loyal mystical companion Ixa, navigating various mortal and divine challenges.\nUpon reaching the city of Hemaira, Deka finds herself thrust into a chaotic battlefield, barely escaping capture by Melanis, a fearsome goddess. Despite the complexities of divine machinations, Deka remains resolute, journeying onwards to Oyomo's Eye, the location of her kelai. She maneuvers through intricate vale traps laid by the gods with help from unlikely allies, including Okot, who transitions from adversary to ally, offering insights into the intricate political landscape of the divine.\nInside the palace, Deka’s group finds themselves ensnared in a mystical chamber that hinders divine intervention. Here, Deka is confronted by Etzli, a goddess exploiting her vulnerabilities by using her mother's likeness. This leads to a fierce confrontation, during which Deka has to confront both physical and emotional challenges. Despite adversity, Deka manages to tap into her bond with Ixa and transforms him into a powerful vessel, showcasing the strength of their connection.\nAs her mortal body succumbs to Etzli's power, Deka bargains with her foe, resulting in the liberation of her allies. With the group free, Deka’s latent connection with the universe is awakened by Queen Ayo and other allies, countering Etzli's manipulation. Queen Ayo subdues Etzli, and White Hands and Sayuri eliminate Melanis.\nWith divine balance restored, Deka embraces her role as Angoro, a divine balancer. She dispenses her siblings among the pantheon, sparing those who worked towards harmony. Enlightened by her journey, Deka acknowledges the interconnectedness of beings and shares her divinity with others, especially those who have been essential to her journey.\nDeka returns to the heavenly realm with her mother, guiding her spirit to the Afterlands—a serene existence awaiting those who have passed on. In an emotional reunion, Deka embraces her transformed existence as a god. Her companions discover her new form in the mortal world, initially shocked but ultimately accepting her divinity. Deka offers her companions the choice to ascend to godhood, but most choose to remain mortal.\nSignificantly, Britta and Li plan to marry and live a mortal life, choosing love and family over eternal life. Adwapa, filled with the memories of her twin sister, decides to step back from divine matters, focusing instead on opening a warrior school. Meanwhile, Deka has empathy even for the unjust, further dissolving her predecessors and their creations into a world where they can thrive.\nThe story concludes in a world radically altered yet harmonious, with Britta and Li marrying in a symbolic ceremony. Their union signifies the unity of Otera’s lands, now free from divine tyranny. As Deka, Keita, and White Hands watch over this transformed world from the divine realm, their new roles as celestial overseers enshrine a future where mortals are free to choose their paths, unhindered by divine edicts. The segment ends with Deka and her companions engaging with a child named Asha in Golma market, hinting at the ongoing renewal and hope in Otera.",
