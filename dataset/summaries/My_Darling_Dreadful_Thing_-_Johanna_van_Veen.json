Their bond deepens amidst challenges, including the haunting presence of Thomas, Agnes's deceased husband, and failed rituals with Agnes’s sister-in-law, Willemijn. Returning home, Roos struggles with repressed trauma and is guided by Ruth, a spectral ally urging her toward spiritual acceptance. Spiritual conflicts intensify as Agnes faces guilt over her past, leading to a siege at Rozentuin orchestrated by Thomas. Agnes’s role in faulty rituals emerges as tensions rise following Willemijn's suspicious death. When Agnes takes deadly pills, Roos, under Ruth's manipulation, believes she's to blame and attempts to bind Agnes’s spirit, helped by Peter, another spirit. Roos’s trial for Agnes’s supposed murder through poison involves a legal defense focused on mental illness, revealing Agnes's overdose as the likely cause of death. Though acquitted, Roos remains guilt-ridden, feeling accountable for Agnes’s fate.\nPost-trial, Doctor Montague aids Roos in rebuilding her life, suggesting treatments and helping her secure a safe, independent living arrangement. Despite skepticism towards her spectral beliefs, he aims to support her societal reintegration. Roos, initially wary of Montague's intentions, accepts his help, learning typing to sustain herself. Despite newfound stability, Roos is haunted by past trauma and the resurgence of Ruth, her spectral self. Montague's writings detail Roos's psychological struggles, framing her experiences as delusional rather than supernatural. Still, Roos feels Ruth’s presence, signifying unresolved attachment to her spiritual identity. The story culminates years later, with Roos maintaining a quiet life while yearning for Agnes. She senses Agnes’s spirit stirring, believing their reunion is imminent and sustaining her through loneliness. Her enduring connection to Agnes suggests a continued acceptance of her spiritual reality, balancing between her love for Agnes and the earthly responsibilities she has begun to embrace.",
