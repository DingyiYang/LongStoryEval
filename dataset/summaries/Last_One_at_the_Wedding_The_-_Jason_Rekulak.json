The entanglement exposes him to the dark secrets of Osprey Cove, particularly after Maggie’s connection with Aidan Gardner leads to his emotional struggle and subsequent suicide. Frank's attempt to shield himself and those he loves from the abominable truth unravels further as he learns of the Gardners' plots and manipulation, culminating in Maggie’s disturbing decision to remain a part of their world.\nIn the aftermath, Frank distances himself from these events though haunted by moral conflict over Maggie’s choices. He finds solace in caring for Abigail, Tammy's foster daughter, who becomes central to his renewed sense of purpose. A mysterious map, however, hints at potential threats from the Gardner family, propelling Frank to seek Maggie’s aid in Boston. Despite recognizing the family’s malevolent reach, he cunningly thwarts them by securing time, warning Tammy and ensuring Abigail’s safety, while cleverly procuring damning evidence against the Gardners.\nAs months pass, Frank grows closer to Tammy and Abigail during her adoption process, becoming a protective and nurturing figure in her life. This relationship contrasts his unresolved connection with Maggie, who becomes embroiled in legal troubles due to the Gardners. He makes a final attempt to reconcile with her at FCI Corbettsville but is rebuffed, underscoring his struggle to reconnect. Forging new bonds with Abigail and the local community, Frank rebuilds a life independent of the Gardners' ominous influence while coming to terms with familial loss and his enduring resolve to protect those he cares for.",
