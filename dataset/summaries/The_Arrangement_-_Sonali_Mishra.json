Initially resistant, he reconsiders through significant conversations with his colleague, Nisha Nandan, with whom he shares an emotional connection. Their co-authored cookbook, \"Raja’s Kitchen,\" unexpectedly becomes a commercial success after Nisha’s glowing review.\nDespite emotional uncertainties, Arjun’s engagement to Sophia, an academic chosen by traditional means, progresses through shared goals, with challenges arising, including a job offer at Stanford. Tensions between Arjun’s culinary aspirations and Sophia’s structured life path surface, especially at a wedding where true love’s portrayal causes him to question his commitments. Even as Nisha confesses her love, Arjun prioritizes familial approval and affirms his engagement with Sophia.\nArjun’s professional ambitions, initially undercut by colleague betrayal, reignite with the unexpected success of \"Raja’s Kitchen,\" prompting him to reconsider his long-standing culinary dreams. However, his emotional entanglement with Nisha persists amidst societal pressures from his mother and the unresolved nature of their relationship.\nComplications re-emerge when Arjun encounters his ex-girlfriend Vicky Chang, prompting introspection about his choices. Arjun grapples with his concept of love and fulfillment, juxtaposing Sophia’s stability with the authenticity he feels with Nisha. A poignant conversation with Vicky further challenges his current path.\nUltimately, Arjun reaches a turning point. After receiving a significant letter from his deceased father on the day of his engagement ceremony, Arjun’s unresolved feelings for Nisha resurface. Upon learning she’s moving away, a song triggers Arjun’s decision to abandon his engagement and follow his heart. He finds Nisha, proclaiming his love, which she reciprocates.\nTwo years later in the Epilogue, Arjun is a successful author and is opening a new restaurant in San Francisco named after Nisha, with whom he happily shares his life, expecting their first child.
