A profound connection establishes itself between Nica and Rigel Wilde, another beleaguered soul from The Grave. Their shared battles with feelings of unworthiness and abandonment bring them closer, their relationship weathered by tumultuous trials, notably when Lionel's envy leads to Nica’s hospitalization. During her convalescence, Nica learns that Rigel maintains a protective distance because of an undisclosed illness. Friends from their fractured past, like the spirited Billie and the compassionate Anna Milligan, alongside reformed adversary Asia Otter, rally to aid Nica's recovery. Rigel, mired in a coma, awakens primarily due to Nica’s persistent companionship, marking a dual journey of healing and deeper mutual affection. Nica’s academic triumph at her graduation underscores her resilience against her trauma and is celebrated amidst a loving circle, punctuated by a promise at Alan's grave to cherish her beloved community.\nThe narrative advances three years, portraying Nica flourishing as a dedicated veterinary student living with Anna, her life charting an auspicious course. Rigel's unexpected appearance on her 21st birthday signals a pivot towards an intimate blend of past adversities and future promises, as they explore the depth of their evolving relationship. During a deeply revealing episode at Rigel’s apartment, his vulnerabilities are laid bare, yet Nica stands as his unwavering anchor. As Nica steps towards an envisioned future alongside Rigel, she faces demons from her past by confronting Margaret, who is ultimately incarcerated. Her testimony, with Adeline’s support, serves as a cathartic confrontation of lingering fears, culminating in unexpected compassion from Asia, aiding in mending old wounds.\nThe emotional landscape shifts anew during Adeline's engagement festivities when Peter, a relic from The Grave, resurrects buried emotions, illuminating a prior relationship between Rigel and Adeline that unsettles Nica. Despite the storm of emotions and unresolved histories, Rigel’s heartfelt avowal of unwavering love for Nica crystallizes their profound connection, transcending time and past indiscretions. Nica’s steadfast journey encompasses embracing a family with Rigel and Rose, their daughter, as depicted in the closing epilogue. Rigel, whose affection blossomed against his insecurities, embraces fatherhood wholeheartedly, while Nica epitomizes warmth and guardianship, weaving a narrative of enduring love. The Christmas setting highlights familial bonds, and the bedtime retelling signifies Nica’s introspection and reaffirmation of their shared legacy and eternal love story, now recounted to their beloved Rose through the lens of legend and myth.",
