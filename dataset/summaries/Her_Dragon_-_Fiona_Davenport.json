Undeterred by his disbelief, Marielle pursues validation, a quest that propels her into a predestined connection with Artemis, a dragon shifter.\nArtemis, sensing the rock's otherworldly energy, tracks it to Marielle's college. Upon meeting Marielle, he instantly recognizes her as his fated mate. This new chapter of their lives starts with curiosity and attraction, leading Artemis to invite her to his secluded cabin, beginning their romantic journey.
