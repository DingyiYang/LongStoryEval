Her journey unfolds through intertwined timelines—present-day challenges and flashbacks to significant moments from her teenage years.\nIn her teenage years, Libby shared a strong bond with Jonah, her foster brother. Their relationship evolved from a close sibling-like connection to romantic tension, leading to a consequential separation. This shift disrupted their lives and left lingering emotions that come into play as the story progresses.\nYears later, Libby is a single mother following a divorce from Brayden, with whom she shares two children, Finn and Isla. She juggles her responsibilities, balancing work and parenting, while dealing with a reemergence of feelings for Jonah, whom she encounters during a hospital antenatal class. This meeting rekindles their emotional connection, prompting both Libby and Jonah to confront their unresolved past.\nLibby is also focused on rebuilding her estranged relationship with her mother, Helen.

Libby must navigate these complex emotions, which involve reassessing past actions and finding pathways to forgiveness and understanding. This part of her journey adds depth to her character as she seeks to integrate the past into her present for personal growth and familial renewal.\nParallel to Libby's story is her sister Nicky's journey. Nicky is a steadfast support system for Libby, providing reliable emotional grounding. She is a midwife dealing with her struggle with infertility, which resonates with Libby's own journey of resilience as both sisters strive to overcome personal and familial challenges.\nBrayden, Libby’s ex-husband, re-enters the scene as a co-parent navigating his new relationship with Silva, his partner, who's about to give birth. Brayden illustrates complexities in shared parenting and evokes past issues tied to Libby's growth trajectory. Libby's interaction with him reveals her strength in managing these complexities while staying focused on her children and personal development.\nThe story reaches an emotional peak with the appearance of Jonah's sister Ellis, who arrives heaving and in labor. Ellis, fleeing an abusive relationship, seeks refuge with Libby. Her arrival brings high stakes, as she fears social services due to her drug history. Both Libby and Nicky step in to offer support, but the situation intensifies, requiring hospital intervention. Jonah remains by Ellis’s side, accentuating the familial theme of loyalty and reconciliation.\nThe epilogue ties the narrative threads together, with Jonah anxiously awaiting the outcome of Ellis's delivery at the hospital.
