This fabricated relationship draws various onlookers and intensifies tensions.\nAt the manor, Blythe strengthens her bond with Julian's daughter, Yvette, through shared experiences and mutual support within society's demanding environments, eventually discovering hidden paintings in the attic, including that of Julian’s late wife, Penelope.
