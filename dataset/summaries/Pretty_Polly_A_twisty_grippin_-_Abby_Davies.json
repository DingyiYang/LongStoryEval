        "overall_sum": "Dr. Jessie England, a therapist for troubled adolescents, becomes enmeshed in the challenging and destructive dynamics of the George family after a series of traumatic events, namely the murder of Richard George and the mysterious disappearance of Polly's brother, Benjamin. Complicating her involvement is Jessie's prior affair with Richard, which breeds guilt and exposes her personal and professional vulnerabilities. As Jessie delves deeper, she struggles with familial dangers, notably involving her sons Michael and James, amidst a tide of malicious forces and psychological strife.\nJessie's world becomes further entangled with Tyler Mason, a young man caught in Polly's web of manipulation, taught to execute acts of vandalism as part of Polly’s games. The narrative is strained by Jessie's blurred professional boundaries, unresolved emotions stemming from previous patients like Roman, and the dangerous obsession of Mark Monroe. Meanwhile, flashbacks reveal the tumultuous and toxic environment of the George family, delineated through Benjamin's perspective—highlighting Polly’s unsettling behavior that indirectly leads to his tragic fate.\nAs the plot thickens, Jessie confronts Polly's dark machinations, realizing the intricate network of deceit and violence Polly weaves, aiming to rectify what she deems as injustices, including the meteoric collapse of the George family following Richard's murder—events intimately tied to Jessie’s own past indiscretions. This spirals into a deadly confrontation where Polly kidnaps Jessie and Michael, a tense standoff revealing Polly's chilling psychopathy through calculated threats and acts of violence, forcing Jessie to fight for her life and those of her loved ones.\nAmidst this emotional and physical subjugation, Jessie's mental resilience is tested. In the climactic face-off, Polly's sinister revenge plan against Michael is thwarted by Mark, who attempts rescue but ends up severely injured. In the chaos, Jessie successfully disarms Polly, ensuring Michael's safety, though not without experiencing additional trauma and reflection on Polly’s threat of future retaliation.\nFast forward six months, Jessie is present at Polly's court hearing, along with her sons, Mark, and friend Eimear. Though Heather George remains supportive of Polly, the revelations—such as Polly possessing sedatives—testify to Polly’s manipulative nature. Despite being held in a juvenile facility, Polly’s manipulative charm remains a concern, hinting at potential future threats. The segment ends with Jessie haunted by Polly's promise of revenge, yet she experiences a sense of relief and resolution in her relationships and personal growth.",
