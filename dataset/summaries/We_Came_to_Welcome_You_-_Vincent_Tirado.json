        "overall_sum": "Sol, a driven Black butch scientist, relocates with her wife Alice to the suburb of Maneless Grove, a place haunted by eerie supernatural phenomena. Their marriage strains as Alice immerses into the community’s influence and Sol grapples with career setbacks and isolation, given the suburb's sinister nuances. Sol partners with Amir, a neighbor, to probe into the disquieting lore of the \"Maneless Missing\" within the community. This narrative explores Sol’s internal and external struggles, clouded by efforts to unravel the community's enigmas, hindered by a workplace accident involving her rival, Dr. Clarke. Tensions escalate during community events, including Corinne’s funeral, as Sol’s premonitions further alienate Alice, who begins making autonomous choices. Sol’s distrust of the community heightens, mainly towards Nadine, amid supernatural and social pressures climaxing during a spa visit revealing hidden truths. A confrontation at Harrison’s Senior Living underscores Sol’s strained paternal bond and internal tug-of-war between personal desires and family duty.\nMeanwhile, a metaphysical entity dubbed \"the neighbor\" offers cryptic counsel, entrenching Sol deeper in spiraling disputes. Surrounding neighbor Finnian unmasks the community’s eerie control through a connected tree network, deepening Sol’s solitude due to skepticism while Alice falls further into enchantment. Sol’s unintended role in the Grove's outreach comes to light, threatening her autonomy and marital bond. Sol navigates through metaphoric and genuine phantoms, endeavoring to uphold her identity amidst surging paranormal vexations of Maneless Grove. Sessions with Dr. Nieman offer little solace as Sol withholds pivotal details, underscoring her isolation. Alice’s behavioral transformation, fueled by the neighborhood’s chilling aura, intensifies Sol’s alarm—most notably after Alice leave her job hastily, isolating herself from family, deepening Sol’s unease.\nA heartfelt dialogue with Alice underscores their waning romance under mystical manipulation, spotlighting Sol’s urgency to salvage past joys. Sol’s resolve to protect each other amidst personal trials underscores their shared history against burgeoning external and internal threats. Prepping for a community bonfire, Sol uncovers eerie phenomena at her residence, deciphering a parasitic force thriving within the community. This entity’s revelation steers Sol’s dealings to align seamlessly with its mechanism, arming her with a covert plan. During the bonfire, Sol maneuvers strategically to subtly shift perceptions, amplify her societal stance, and openly pitch her candidacy for community presidency, hinting at her intent to counteract the Grove's grip from within, retaking authority over her life to shield herself and Alice from succumbing to the community's voracious essence.\nNow, settled at Havenstar Cafe, Sol balances these freshly acquired duties following her electoral win, benefitting from delegating tasks which stabilize her mental state amidst sensory overload provoked by community connections. Amir joins her, facing fuzziness induced by \"the pollen,\" resulting in memory lapses. They humorously converse over mundane topics like Amir’s family dilemmas and Sol’s escapades concerning her father’s nursing home antics. Sol neutralized her father’s turmoil with a metaphorical gift, aligning their relationship positively. As Amir muses on a potential move, the idea of connecting with Andor’s Grove intrigues Sol, suggesting future opportunities, and subtly linking back to her established network.",
