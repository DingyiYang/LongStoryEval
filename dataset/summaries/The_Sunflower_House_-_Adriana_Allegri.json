        "overall_sum": "In 2006, Kat discovers the clandestine past of her mother Allina during World War II. In Nazi Germany, Allina, a Jewish woman living under a false Aryan identity, collaborates with Karl von Strassberg, a high-ranking Nazi officer with Jewish roots, to undermine Nazi policies and save children from exploitation. Their partnership, initially a marriage of convenience, grows into a profound emotional bond as they plan for the future amidst the war's chaos. Allina becomes pregnant, symbolizing hope against the backdrop of tyranny.\nAt Hochland Home, a facility under Nazi control, Allina and Karl secretly assist a resistance network. Working closely with allies like Rilla Weber and Schwester Ziegler, Allina manages to save children from medical experiments. Karl, risking his position, aides in relocating these children while evading Nazi scrutiny. However, their mission becomes increasingly perilous as personal and external pressures mount. Allina finds solace at home, but Karl’s insistence underscores the urgency of escape to preserve their safety.\nBy 1941, their precarious plans face new challenges. With Rilla's engagement and Karl’s urgent mission, Allina's departure is accelerated. Arriving at Adele's home in Switzerland, she finds a clandestine refuge where child rescues are orchestrated under Adele’s supervision. Adele, revealing herself as a dedicated ally, helps Allina navigate deceit and plan her escape, prepared to conceal her actions further if needed.\nDespite brief moments of camaraderie and shared purpose with Adele, the looming threat of discovery persists. Karl’s safety and the children's futures weigh heavily on Allina’s mind as she balances personal fears with the larger resistance effort.\nKarl’s arrest and execution devastates Allina, but it marks the beginning of her journey toward safety. Under Adele's guidance, and adopting a new identity as Allina Strauss, she and Katrine escape to America, aided by Elias, a trusted ally. In Portugal, Elias helps Allina conceal her identity until they secure passage across the Atlantic, where she builds a new life, free from past burdens.\nDecades later, in 2006, Allina shares her story with Kat, deepening their relationship amid realizations of bravery and sacrifice from Allina's past. The genuine emotional bond they cultivate bridges the gap created by decades of secrecy. In 2010, following Allina’s peaceful death, Kat reflects on her mother's legacy, filled with love, courage, and their newfound understanding. She honors Allina by maintaining her memory and truths, instilling a lasting peace in their family.",
