        "overall_sum": "Mary re-engages with the BDSM scene in New York, where she deepens her connection with Ronan, a Scottish Dominant. While exploring her desires, Mary begins to heal from her past trauma caused by her former Dominant, Lucas. Her relationship with Ronan offers a secure environment for rediscovery, but emotional complexities arise, particularly related to Ronan’s former submissive, Keira, who falsely claims pregnancy. This emotional turmoil forces Mary to reconsider her partnership with Ronan, especially as she draws inspiration from her friend Brenda’s stable life with Dalton.\nMary’s personal growth parallels Ronan's struggle to reconcile his Dominant nature with newfound deep feelings for her. Their relationship faces a turning point when Mary is caught in a café holdup. Forewarned by a premonition from his grandmother, Yvette, Ronan rushes there and is shot while creating a diversion, which lands him in the hospital.\nIn the hospital, Ronan learns he has a small tumor in his pancreas, discovered early enough to be treated. With Mary by his side, he reflects on his near-death experience and expresses his romantic love for her, thanks to her influence. Mary, now determined to learn Voodoo from Yvette, finds a deeper purpose and connection beyond her current life path. Six months afterward, Ronan’s cancer is in remission, and they’re committed to each other.\nRonan, who initially spent two months in Las Vegas for work, decides he can’t remain away from Mary. He orchestrates their life to be in New Orleans, fulfilling Mary’s wish to find her place in the world. At Black Rose Underground, he proposes to her, symbolizing a balance between their BDSM roles during play and equal partnership in life. Mary accepts, confirming her role as a cherished partner emboldened by love and self-discovery.",
