        "overall_sum": "Tess Pine attempts to rebuild her life in Hawthorne following social ostracism by her former church, Grace Presbyterian, due to an unintended pregnancy and abortion. As Tess navigates hostility, particularly from church member Roger, she finds solace among new friends like fellow musicians Chloe, Connor, and Mia, who provide the camaraderie and support she desperately needs. Despite estrangement from her grandparents, Tess seeks self-awareness, mending friendships with allies such as Bri, evidenced by her music-themed birthday celebration.\nTess's concerns mount upon seeing Alden, her former manipulative youth minister, seemingly targeting Kayla, prompting Tess to act. Bolstered by the accounts of Reagan and Bri, Tess dedicates the Spirit Light Festival to vocalize her experiences against Alden, demonstrating her personal growth and resolve to impart change. Tess's decision echoes her broader initiative with the Scarlet Support Project, a platform addressing abuse, autonomy, and societal norms, promoting a healing collective beyond her immediate tale.\nTess’s grandmother criticizes the Scarlet Support Project during a meeting in Needleman's parking lot, expressing fear of community changes. Tess maintains her resolute stance, choosing sadness over anger. At the festival, where her campaign’s red A T-shirts draw attention, Tess has significant encounters with Roger and Alden. Roger serves as a foil to her newfound strength, while Alden’s inauthentic support affirms Tess’s disinterest in reverting to the past.\nDuring the festival, Tess’s performance marks newfound personal empowerment, using her music to articulate her journey. Supporting voices join her, wearing red A shirts indicative of solidarity and resilience. The performance symbolizes a platform for advocacy, underscoring Tess’s belief that survivors of abuse deserve attention and affirmation.\nA few days after the festival, Tess learns Alden left town after being confronted about rumors regarding inappropriate behavior with teens. Tess reflects on how Alden’s departure impacts her, leading her to accept the closure it provides. She attends a dinner with her grandparents, where past grievances surface, but there's a shared interest in reconciliation. Her grandmother shows interest in the Scarlet Support Project, hinting at her experiences with silence on women's issues.\nTess notes that the stigma symbolized by the \"A\" on her locker is slowly fading, potentially through Roger’s quiet attempts to make amends. The fading A suggests that past choices will become just parts of her story, as she looks toward a hopeful future. Discussions with Reagan unveil a decision to join efforts in legally confronting Alden, choosing to protect future victims despite the emotional cost.\nAlongside her ongoing involvement with advocacy groups, Tess encounters Kayla, another of Alden’s victims, who thanks Tess for her warning. This encounter solidifies Tess’s resolve to join Reagan in taking legal action against Alden. Tess continues growing through her community projects and personal relationships, indicating a resurgence of empowerment and supportive communal bonds.",
