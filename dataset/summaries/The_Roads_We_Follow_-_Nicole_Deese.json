Tensions run high, especially with her eldest sister, Adele, who is concerned about the impact on their family's recovering business. Raegan plans a memoir as a counter-narrative, but her intentions leak during a festival, exacerbating family discord. Underlying issues surface, related to their connection with Micah Davenport, their driver deeply tied to the Farrows through his late mother, Lynn.\nMicah aims to understand his family links with the Farrows. The journey is fraught with Raegan's self-doubt and Micah's identity search. As they visit significant sites, they reflect on Lynn's influential legacy. Raegan doubts her memoir, while familial tensions heighten, including concerning secrets about her brother-in-law, Peter.

Adele confesses health concerns, while Hattie reveals authoring the tell-all due to custody fears during her divorce. This draws the sisters closer, paving the way for reconciliation. The focal point is Camp Selkirk, integral to the Farrow family's past. Micah joins the Farrows in inheriting the camp, linking back to Lynn’s vision of unity and legacy.
