        "overall_sum": "Following the assassination of Emperor Yuri, Empress Isidora rules with tyranny, suppressing dissent and dealing with external threats. Sisters Sera and Galina, who wield god-like powers from their mother's experiments, lead a rebellion against Isidora's regime. As leaders of the insurgency, they face numerous challenges: navigating court politics, organizing secretive operations, and enlisting the help of insiders like Katya, once a palace handmaiden.\nThe rebellion intensifies at a royal ball when a failed assassination highlights growing unrest. Galina protects her allies, notably Princess Vasilisa, who sides with the insurgents. This act fortifies Vasilisa’s dedication to opposing her mother’s oppressive rule. Sera, driven by vengeance and liberation ideals, leads the rebellion with her husband, Vitaly. Their revolutionary aims are tested by personal sacrifices and the cruelty of the regime.\nSera works tirelessly on a panacea amid increasing chaos, relying heavily on Vitaly's support. Her resolve is challenged when loyalty to captured comrades is at odds with survival instincts. Meanwhile, Galina, coerced into accompanying Isidora, witnesses the empress's cruel dominance over a suffering populace. In a climactic confrontation on an execution platform, Sera, Vitaly, and Katya remain defiant in the face of Isidora’s fury. The arrival of Vasilisa signifies a chance of rescue. Defying her mother, Vasilisa reveals her weakened state publicly, symbolizing her rebellion.\nIn a pivotal moment, Galina shatters Isidora’s power by severing the empress’s bond with her zmeya, liberating the oppressed and announcing a new era of autonomy. Isidora's exile marks a dramatic turn in Tumanny’s governance. In the aftermath, Katya, relieved of her chains, is ushered into political involvement to aid the post-regime transition. She joins Sera, Vitaly, Galina, and newly empowered leaders to forge a future free from tyranny.\nIn the epilogue, Sera and Vitaly adjust to their leadership roles amidst ongoing threats. They balance strategic planning with personal acknowledgment of their bond, ensuring their romance doesn't fall victim to political pressures. Galina and Vasilisa deepen their relationship in the face of looming conflict, pledging marriage as a commitment to their shared future. Sera and Galina contemplate the pending battle against an emerging army but remain hopeful, secure in the homes and bonds they’ve forged amidst the rebellion.",
