Her path is marked by the challenge of navigating intrusive thoughts, vividly depicted through metaphors such as a crocodile symbolizing her compulsion and anxiety. Wildwood amusement park serves as both a refuge and battleground, where Ariel confronts her fears supported by friends Ruth and Rex, whose presence is crucial for Ariel’s emotional development.\nAriel's family, particularly her traditional parents, fails to grasp her mental health struggles, leading to a feeling of isolation. Her sister Mandy, however, remains a supportive ally, guiding Ariel towards self-acceptance amid familial pressures. Ariel’s introspective journey at Wildwood reveals moments of vulnerability, community, and strength. Her interactions with Ruth offer guidance on identity and defiance of societal norms, while Rex grounds her with humor and stability.

Ariel’s internal conflict projects onto remembered dialogues with coworkers like Megga and her sister Leah, who represent both struggles and aspirations. Leah’s departure to Washington, DC, has left Ariel with unresolved emotions, festering insecurities, and contemplations on friendship and desire. Ariel reaches towards reconciliation, pondering Leah’s hypothetical perception of her growth and change.\nIn this segment, Ariel's reconciliation with her internal chaos culminates when she finds herself trusted with the Loco Loco train controls. As the train inches forward under her command, Ariel embraces trust, unity, and the protected simplicity of her youthful companions Ruth and Rex. Ariel’s gratitude is juxtaposed courageously by her emerging resolve and reformed view of herself. Her laughter amidst Ruth and Rex’s intimacy on the ride stands as a liberating moment, reaffirming her comfort in shared happiness despite personal battles.
