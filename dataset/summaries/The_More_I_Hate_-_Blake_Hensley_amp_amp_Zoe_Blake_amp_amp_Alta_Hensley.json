        "overall_sum": "Amelia Astrid and Lucian Manwarring's initial engagement is rooted in family obligations and business strategies rather than romance. Lucian, a wealthy heir, sees Amelia as a strategic alliance, manipulating her engagement to Marksen Dubois with Amelia's mother, Mary's complicity. Over time, Lucian's perception shifts as genuine affection surfaces amidst budding respect for Amelia. She, in turn, grapples with her family's controlling expectations, aiming for autonomy and meaning beyond the elite's mercenary motives.\nBoth face internal and external conflicts, with familial and social pressures. Lucian struggles with his feelings and his domineering father’s influence, prioritizing Amelia's genuine happiness over traditional power pursuits. He challenges his father's ruthless tactics, envisioning a better future for Amelia and his siblings.\nAmelia, with support from siblings Rose and Harrison, explores independence as Luc aids her artistic aspirations, balancing care with confronting familial expectations. After overhearing Luc's poignant conversation with his father, she flees to find autonomy beyond a mere business transaction. Her escape sets the stage for confrontation, with Luc determined to show real change and investment beyond mere practicality.\nAmelia retreats to Grounds for Sculpture in New Jersey, reflecting on her journey and the meaning of true freedom. Luc finds her, attempting to mend their broken relationship. Despite his heartfelt pleas, Amelia prioritizes her independence, turning down his marriage proposal.\nTime passes. Amelia embraces independence, moving into a Brooklyn apartment with Harrison's help, considering a teaching career for fulfillment beyond social constraints. Despite occasional longing for Luc, she remains committed to self-discovery. A serendipitous city encounter elicits nostalgic feelings but reinforces her resolve to uphold autonomy.\nLuc orchestrates a grand gesture—an art school for Amelia, affirming it as a non-bribed act of love, with no strings attached. Amelia is surprised and touched, recognizing the sincerity in his efforts to apologize and win her back. The moment leads to reconciliation, grounded by Amelia’s admission of mutual needs—balancing his forceful nature with her autonomy, finding a middle ground in their love.\nTheir renewed relationship culminates in a wedding, this time genuinely fueled by love and happiness. The ceremony, set in a meaningful park location, signifies Amelia’s growth from her past, choosing love freely over obligation and societal pressure.\nIn the epilogue, a new conflict surfaces as an unnamed antagonist, scorned from losing Amelia and future wealth, targets Luc’s sister Olivia as a form of revenge. This sets the stage for impending challenges in Amelia and Luc’s evolving life together.",
