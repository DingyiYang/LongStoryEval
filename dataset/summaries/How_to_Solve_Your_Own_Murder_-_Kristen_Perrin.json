Guided by Frances's will, which outlines her wish for justice, Annie unravels family secrets imbedded deeply within the estate's history. Frances’s diaries provide a thread for Annie to follow, revealing a tangled family history filled with interpersonal conflicts and scandal, most prominently relating to Emily Sparrow’s mysterious disappearance and subsequent murder at the hands of Rose Leroy. These diaries depict Frances’s internal struggles concerning her relationship with Ford Ripley, adding layers to her enigmatic personality and past decisions.\nAnnie navigates dangerous family dynamics as she investigates, building an alliance with Detective Crane. Her search for truth becomes perilous when she confronts Saxon and Elva, relatives involved in a clandestine drug operation. She collects incriminating evidence against Saxon, who actively attempts to thwart her efforts. The encounter reaches a climax when Annie provokes Joe Leroy, Rose’s son, into confessing to Frances’s murder. An attempted attack by Joe is thwarted with timely help from Walt and Beth, alongside a dramatic intervention by Detective Crane.\nAfter resolving the immediate danger, Annie regroups at Gravesdown Hall. She revisits the events that transpired, piecing together how Rose's jealousy and troubled past propelled her to murder Emily Sparrow, wearing clothes Frances had given her. This revelation supports the notion that Frances, understanding the web of deception within her family, intended for Annie to inherit the estate and carry forward her vision of justice.\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, Annie chooses to visit an unrepentant Rose. This visit marks Annie’s acceptance of her family’s history of betrayal, reinforcing her commitment to break the cycle. After inheriting Frances's estate, Annie reflects on her journey, the sacrifices involved, and her strengthened relationship with Detective Crane, who steers her toward justice and reconciliation.\nThe narrative concludes with a poignant moment during Frances’s funeral wake. As Annie mingles with the crowd, Oliver admits to leaving threatening notes unwittingly found among Frances's things—an act born of desperation rather than malice. Detective Crane warns Annie of her impending testimony at Joe's trial, reigniting her resolve to see justice served. The wake concludes with a reflection on Frances's life and the bequeathed empty notebooks waiting for Annie, symbolizing a future filled with possibilities and narrative continuity.",
