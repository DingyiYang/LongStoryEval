        "overall_sum": "Rosie Butler navigates a transformative journey following her breakup with James, seeking autonomy and fulfillment. She moves into a flat with Aled Thomas, a gentle and introspective teacher. Together, they develop a close friendship while caring for a stray cat, Springsteen, which becomes a symbol of their bond. Working at Rhianne's deli, Rosie regains her confidence, inspiring colleague Tobi to pursue higher education.\nRosie's path is continually shaped by her mother Julie’s traditional expectations, contrasting sharply with her newfound independence. Meanwhile, Rosie develops feelings for Aled—fraught with lingering confusion due to his reserved demeanor and owing to interactions like their nearly-romantic moments and Aled’s quietly protective nature. Aled's firm stance against unhealthy family dynamics further strengthens his connection with Rosie, despite their relationship's unresolved status.\nAmidst a tense reunion with James, who is now with Dylan, Rosie experiences clarity, decisively turning down James’s recycled proposal and embracing her independence. The tumultuous period is mitigated by the support of her friends at the deli, especially Rhianne. Rosie also confronts her friend Niamh about prioritizing others to her detriment, a pivotal moment which leads both to reassess their lives—Niamh opting for freelance work and Rosie choosing to apply for university.\nMisunderstandings arise when Aled misconstrues Rosie’s dealings concerning James, leading to a withdrawal. With guidance from Rhianne, Rosie decides to travel to Wales to rectify things with Aled, supported by a now-supportive Niamh. As they drive through inclement weather, Rosie reflects on her growth and emotional journey. Upon reaching Wales, they walk through a storm to Aled’s guest house, where Rosie courageously avows her love for Aled, resolving past miscommunications, especially regarding a building sale she'd misunderstood.\nIn an emotional revelation, Aled confesses his love for Rosie, acknowledging it predates their shared experiences in London and that he paused plans on selling family property because of her. His family's good-natured reception and amused support frame this tender reconciliation. Rosie proposes a future together, to which Aled joyfully agrees, concluding with a heartfelt kiss amidst familial elation. The epilogue reveals Rosie thriving in London, with Aled and their cat, amid cherished routines and a reassuring understanding of home as a shared space defined by love rather than physical confines.",
