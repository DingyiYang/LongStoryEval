Whiskee, dealing with past traumas and her father's and mother's tragic end, discovers solace in her growing bond with Beethoven. Despite initial resentment, Beethoven transitions from his role in the family's criminal activities, driven by love for Whiskee and ethical dilemmas.\nConflict arises when Beethoven discovers surveillance bugs and potential rats in their organization, revealing federal investigation risks. He admits to Whiskee and Carlos the truth behind their mother's murder and his protective actions, deepening the rift but also forging reluctant trust with Carlos. The two families plan to move away for a new beginning, with Beethoven securing Carlos' alignments to producing interests by putting him in charge of a legitimate venture and shared dreams with Whiskee for a legal life, cementing their future at Rose Valley Hills.\nThe fragility of their newfound peace is shattered during a pre-engagement dinner, where familial loyalty is tested.
