        "overall_sum": "\"Mist Across Mountains\" artfully weaves a narrative of justice and resilience across dual timelines. In the contemporary story, Valerie, a national park ranger, is driven to unveil illegal logging practices orchestrated by Alton Parker, a powerful and influential figure. Her journey with Curtis, a steadfast ally, sees them entangled in a web of deceit, guiding Valerie toward deeper familial and communal roots. The park’s integrity and her son Charlie's future are foremost, fueling a quest for truth against systemic corruption.\nValerie and Curtis are supported by youth allies, Braden and Rachel, whose independent efforts illuminate Parker's operations. Their discoveries reveal the depth of Parker's exploitation and set the stage for a climactic confrontation. Braden's personal story of protecting his grandmother’s land intertwines with the broader narrative of preserving integrity against exploitation.\nIn exploring historical parallels, the book delves into Hazel Rusk's past, showcasing her leadership at Shelterwood Camp, a refuge for runaway children in early 20th-century Oklahoma. Hazel, known also as Ollie, exhibits courageous tenacity in shielding her makeshift family from predatory threats embodied by Tesco Peele. Her legacy, while initially fractured, exudes a spirit of resilience and advocacy, echoing into the present as Valerie's investigation climaxes. \nThe contemporary plot reaches resolution as the US Attorney indicts Parker on multiple charges. These actions are bolstered by the historical narrative's revelation of Ollie's father’s involvement in protective rites for Choctaw children, linking past struggles with the present call for justice. Valerie, emboldened by Budgie’s trust, takes on the task of commemorating Shelterwood’s legacy within the park, a tribute to the resilience of children's justice and protection across generations.\nThe narrative culminates with personal reflections and hopes for new beginnings as Valerie and Curtis share a hopeful path forward. Building family and home serves as a central theme, connecting their pursuit of justice to enduring love and community legacy. These themes solidify in the extended arcs of modern and historical timelines, celebrating courage, justice, and homecoming in the elusive mist across time’s mountains.",
