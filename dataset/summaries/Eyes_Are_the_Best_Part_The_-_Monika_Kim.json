        "overall_sum": "Ji-won Lim is a college student trapped in a turbulent spiral of academic stress, family dysfunction, and deteriorating mental health. As her turmoil deepens, she struggles with irrational thoughts and violent hallucinations, driven by the pressures of familial expectations and her chaotic environment. Amidst this backdrop, her mother, Umma, plans to marry George, whose insensitivity and deceit exacerbate Ji-won’s alienation. In defiance, Ji-won exploits George’s indiscretions, leading to his job loss and igniting further familial discord.\nHer mental instability grows, manifesting in disturbing hallucinations that signify her inner rage and culminate in an accidental killing. Throughout these events, Ji-won finds solace and a semblance of stability in her younger sister, Ji-hyun, though their bond becomes strained under the weight of Ji-won’s chaotic actions.\nAs tensions mount, Ji-won’s personal relationships become a tumultuous backdrop where her friendship with Alexis offers brief consolation, while Geoffrey’s support turns unsettling. His romantic advances and his possession of her backpack—a potential evidence link to her dark actions—amplify her paranoia and fears.\nUnderneath these personal struggles, Ji-won navigates complicated family dynamics. Her determination to protect her family intensifies as she uncovers George’s malignant intentions, but Umma’s denial leads to greater frustration and fuels Ji-won’s psychological decline. The shocking discovery of a brain tumor reveals a physical cause for her unstable condition, presenting prospects for a potential recovery.\nHowever, Ji-won’s resolve to disable George ironically unspools into a disastrous confrontation involving Geoffrey. When police intervene, Ji-won finds herself grappling with these violent consequences in a hospital setting, where revelations about her condition, her family’s hidden truths, and her potential path forward emerge.\nIn the aftermath of these events, Ji-won manipulates her circumstances with cold precision. She learns George is in a room next to hers and plots her revenge. After suspending her medication to remain alert, she meticulously executes her plan, feeding George drug-laced cranberry juice before killing him. Ji-won frames Geoffrey for the murder by leading him into a trap where he discovers George’s body, setting off a chain of events that results in his arrest.\nIn the midst of this chaos, Ji-won receives startling news that her father is having a baby with someone else. This revelation reinforces her resentment toward him and sharpens her resolve to confront him in the future. Ji-won’s actions underscore a complex mix of madness, cunning, and a deeply rooted need for control amidst her unraveling world.",
