        "overall_sum": "Caroline Baldwin's journey traverses dual timelines in 1927 Minneapolis and 1727 aboard the pirate ship Ocean Curse. Initially, in the 1727 timeline, she disguises herself as a cabin boy, eventually forming a significant bond with Marcus Zale, the quartermaster known as Maxwell MacDougal. As they near Boston, tensions rise concerning Marcus's fate until he receives a pardon from Governor Dummer in exchange for renouncing piracy. This notable event marks the start of his transformation, moving towards legitimate maritime pursuits.\nIn the 1927 timeline, Caroline experiences turmoil due to her father's public scandal and her complex family dynamics. A discovery about her time-crossing ability, passed down through generations, propels her into understanding her dual existence. Visiting Salem, she meets her ancestral family, including Hope Abbott, who reveals the weight of the decision Caroline must make on her 21st birthday—to choose one timeline permanently. \nCaroline's connection with Marcus in 1727 deepens into a profound, transformative love, while her life in 1927 is marked by familial revelations and personal ties. Her dual existence challenges her understanding of identity and compels her to choose between a love-filled future with Maxwell in 1727, and the stability of her modern life in 1927.\nChoosing to embrace life in 1727, Caroline spends her last day in 1927 cherishing modern comforts and farewells with her family and friends. She confides her choice to her parents, receiving a blessing from her father Daniel, whose faith and strength provide comfort. Caroline navigates painful goodbyes, finding solace in familial love. Meanwhile, her last moments with Lewis carry emotional weight as he expresses a longstanding love for her. \nOn her birthday, September 2, 1727, Caroline marries Maxwell at Christ Church in Boston, supported by Hope and Isaac Abbott. The ceremony is simple but significant, symbolizing a deliberate choice, profound belonging, and a newfound closeness to God. Post-wedding, Maxwell introduces her to their refurbished ship—now the Redemption—emphasizing their new path and fresh start.\nThree days later, on September 5, 1727, in Cape Cod, Caroline and Maxwell arrive to reconcile with Maxwell's family. Alish and Liam welcome them warmly, accepting Caroline and rejoicing over Maxwell's transformation. This homecoming symbolizes familial healing and closure for Maxwell's past seafaring life. Simultaneously, Caroline writes to her grandfather in 1927, expressing hope for reconciliation. By now, Caroline embraces her new family wholeheartedly, finding peace and belonging with Maxwell, eager to explore her connections in 1727 further.",
