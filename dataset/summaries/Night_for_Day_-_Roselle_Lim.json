        "overall_sum": "Camille Buhay and Ward Dunbar, two mortals, find themselves entangled in divine machinations involving a series of mysterious shops in London. Camille, influenced by Mr. Samson, and aided by Mr. King of the Eastern Faction, uncovers haunted artifacts integral to an ongoing divine war. Concurrently, Ward cooperates with Madam Selene to navigate celestial tokens and secrets. As their paths intersect, they reconcile godly antics with their revived relationship, amidst newfound chaos. Under omnipresent scrutiny, Time and Chaos, celestial forces, observe the divine conflict unfolding. The Western Faction’s deceitful god, Theo, involuntarily draws Camille and Ward into the immortal struggle, escalating divine politics, and imposing life-altering and perilous choices upon them, which also bring their pasts into sharp relief.\nThe divine stakes increase as Ward unlocks a significant artifact, elevating their involvement in the celestial strife. Camille teeters on the brink of death, only to be rescued through Mr. Samson’s sacrifice – a revelation that Mr. Samson is Ward's future self, ensnared by divine factionalism for decades. Ward is then ensnared into a trap by Theo, involving a pivotal box central to the divine war. This tumult culminates in a trial-like judgment, officiated by Time and Chaos, ending the divine war with a verdict favoring the Eastern Faction due to Camille and Ward’s decisions. Time extends unprecedented favors to the couple for resolving the cosmic conflict.\nReunited, Ward and Camille express an enduring bond and deliberate on their options, opting for a future unencumbered by divine threads, enhancing joy, liberty, and promise. Among the starting steps, Ward’s proposal symbolizes their commitment to facing all of life’s adventures together, free from extra-terrestrial influence. In the epilogue, having spent time secluded and reconnecting, Camille and Ward emerge to start anew in London but are inspired by a fortuitous meeting with the world-traveling older couple, Samson and Selene Smith. This prompts a sudden yet freeing decision to experience Paris prior to commencing their careers. As they contemplate an unexpected lavish treat via Mr. King’s unexplained generosity, Camille and Ward look forward to a spontaneous and fulfilling future together, relishing life’s offerings and experiences.",
