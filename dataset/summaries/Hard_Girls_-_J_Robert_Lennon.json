Their lives, already colored by neglect and the enigmatic absence of their mother, Anabel, spiral further as Jane confesses to protect Lila from legal repercussions. On the run from the law, they traverse America, unable to establish permanent roots. Their journey highlights the blurring of moral boundaries, enduring familial adversities, and newly acquired survival skills.\nConcurrent with the sisters' flight is the narrative of their father, Harry Pool, as he confronts his past and the manipulative forces that influenced his life, including Anabel's involvement in espionage. Jane's tumultuous path leads her to a trial that scrutinizes her actions under the shadow of her family's legacy. Despite clarifying her intentions of protecting Lila from assault, Jane receives a conviction for involuntary manslaughter.

Her marriage, weighed down by past conflicts and societal pressures, eventually crumbles. The sisters reunite, directed by an email from Lila suggesting unfinished business. They confront Anabel, forced into a confrontation marked by revelations about their mother’s espionage and its impact on their identities. The confrontation leads to chaos at Anabel’s compound, culminating in a desperate and disillusioned escape.\nReturning to their family home, Jane negotiates shared custody for Chloe amidst Chance’s apologies and reluctance to fight. Concurrently, Jane and Chloe work to rejuvenate Harry's life, symbolized by the physical cleaning of his home. Harry, regaining some spirit, agrees to semi-retirement and begins to revisit aspirations abandoned due to past burdens.

Harry’s history with espionage surfaces briefly, casting shadows on the family’s present. The shared burning of Harry’s past documents becomes a moment of catharsis and closure, albeit with hints of underlying secrets, as Lila slips one of the notebooks into her pocket.
