        "overall_sum": "In 1877, Cora Dove, an American advocate for women's rights, enters a marriage of convenience with Leo, the Earl of Devonworth. This union promises mutual financial stability, with Cora supporting her family back in New York and Leo addressing his own monetary challenges. However, their relationship evolves unexpectedly due to shared values and growing emotional connection, alongside societal expectations and the turbulent political climate of the time.\nThe marriage allows both to pursue their ambitions: Cora’s fervent social justice causes and Leo’s efforts to steer his estate toward recovery. At Devonworth's ancestral seat, Timberscombe Park, the couple collaborates on managing estate affairs, navigating Cora’s history with her benefactor, Mr. Hathaway, and discovering mutual love and respect characterized by progressive social ideals.\nWhen they return to London, external pressures strain their relationship. Particularly, Lord Bolingrave’s schemes pose a significant threat to their union. As Cora becomes more involved in women's rights protests, Leo is torn between his protective instincts and genuine support for her causes, ultimately falling into a political quagmire that sees him manipulated into voting against the Women’s Property Act, against his and Cora’s principles.\nTensions mount when Cora discovers Leo's conflicted vote through her family, causing a significant trust rift. Their confrontation over their perceived betrayals test their relationship’s resilience. However, they delve into truths surrounding their and each other's actions, and eventually reaffirm their trust and commitment.\nTheir resolve is further tested by dangers and manipulations, such as a kidnapping incident in Hyde Park linked to Leo’s past dealings. Throughout these adversities, Cora and Leo’s relationship solidifies, bonded by a shared determination to challenge societal norms and confront political threats together.\nIn the epilogue, set in Rome, Cora and Leo enjoy their honeymoon, reflecting on their journey and love that emerged in a marriage initially forged from convenience. Their tranquil moments in Rome provide a pause from London’s political and social turbulence. Cora’s recognition of Leo’s attentive gestures—like gifts that hold personal significance—symbolizes the depth of his love and care. Yet, this peace is disrupted by a telegram from Cora's sister, Eliza, who announces the end of her engagement due to falling in love with someone else, prompting Cora and Leo to return to England ready to support Eliza and confront any unfolding challenges.\nUltimately, Cora undergoes a transformative journey from a pragmatic idealist to a woman fully embracing her emotional and marital partnership with Leo. Together, they transcend the confines of a marriage of convenience, forging a loving, supportive union grounded in shared visions for justice amid their society's rigid expectations.",
