        "overall_sum": "In the tumultuous realm of Yusan, deposed Prince Euyn, Mikail, and their band of rebels plan to overthrow the tyrannical King Joon during the tumultuous tuhko championship. Amidst rising political unrest, they aim for strategic assassination and Euyn's reinstatement, relying on secrecy and alliances. The mission is plagued by betrayal, especially as Aeri, a skilled thief, grapples with her loyalties due to her concealed identity as Joon's daughter. Sora's attempt to hasten Joon's demise via poisoning fails, and Mikail's plans are thwarted by Bay Chin's betrayal. The plot's unraveling exposes Royo to Aeri's deception, disrupting the rebellion further.\nCaptured and presented at Qali Palace, the rebels find they've walked into an elaborate trap orchestrated by Joon, who sought to test their skills for his own ends. With Aeri's personal agenda conflicting with the rebels' cause, they face new risks. Joon manipulates the situation to redirect their efforts, demanding they steal the Ring of Khitan within five weeks, promising rewards of power and redemption. Euyn weighs his motivations for royal reinstatement while managing newfound responsibilities as the group's leader.\nThe group's dynamics are fraught with tension. Mikail, burdened by his role as a strategist and his complex relationship with Euyn, navigates alliances amidst Joon’s machinations. Sora, emotionally tethered to her sister, faces overwhelming challenges as she juggles personal vendettas with the burdens of rebellion. Royo's trust is shattered, yet he remains focused on clearing injustices associated with his past. Aeri, torn by her duties as Joon's daughter, balances on a precipice of loyalty and betrayal.\nDespite the concessions offered by Joon, the rebels consider the near-impossible nature of their new mission and Joon's threats, including dire consequences for failure. They realize Joon's fear of their sister Quilimar presents an opportunity; by leveraging this vulnerability, they hope to turn their dangerous predicament into a chance for empowerment and revenge.",
