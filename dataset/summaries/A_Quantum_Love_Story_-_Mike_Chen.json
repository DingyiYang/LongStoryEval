        "overall_sum": "Mariana and Carter are caught in a repeating time loop due to anomalies from the Hawke Accelerator disaster. This chaotic loop is tied to Project Pen, which enables interaction with various times using a temporal energy beam. As a dedicated neuroscientist, Mariana balances her calculative and emotional sides to reverse the disaster's effects, deeply motivated by her love for her stepsister Shay and friendship with Carter, who evolves from a culinary dreamer to a steadfast aide amidst his memory lapses.\nGuidance from Kendra Hall—a mysterious figure and perhaps the foremost time traveler—arms Mariana with the tools necessary for timeline manipulation. Mariana skips back two decades with her AI companion Bowie, aiming to subtly tweak the Hawke Accelerator's configuration to avert the catastrophic future. She carves out a clandestine existence in the past focused on meticulous historical safeguarding, yet intervenes in Shay's life to guide her away from a doomed path.\nIn the present, Mariana enacts her plan to amend the timeline at the accelerator, overcoming her fears and inserting system updates to prevent future tragedies. Faced with the emotional weight of the mission, she navigates the chance of erasure for a free-flowing future. This leads to a climactic scene where Mariana races against time to retrieve Carter's notebook, writing a note that potentially reconnects her younger self with Carter.\nUpon completion of the cycle with no disaster evident, it becomes evident Mariana’s influence might be redirecting the destinies of herself and Carter. Following Mariana’s disappearance, Carter stumbles upon the note—a seemingly innocuous message about donuts that evokes a sense of curiosity and déjà vu. This coincidences with his meeting Mariana in the altered future, signaling a freshly charted course for them both.\nIn another thread, Kendra exits her temporal exile after successfully returning from time travel. Although interrogated by Beckett with subtle hints regarding Mariana's actions, she provides no links about knowing Mariana, signifying that the latest timeline might be unfolding as Mariana hoped. Beckett’s veiled inquiries confirm the potential success of Mariana’s adjustments, with their implications continuing to ripple unnoticed through the span of time.",
