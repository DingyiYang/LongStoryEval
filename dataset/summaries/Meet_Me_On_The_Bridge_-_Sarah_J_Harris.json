Her actions, however, bring about unintended consequences, impacting the dynamics of her loved ones. The narrative begins with Alex's demise, spurring Julia to utilize the necklace to save Charles Fielding, inadvertently causing a domino effect that alters timelines and instigates life-transforming events. Despite her efforts, Alex’s death remains inescapable due to despair and attempted suicide, leading to his death by other means.\nUpon awakening nearly a year later in a timeline devoid of Alex, Julia grapples with the emotional turmoil wrought by the sacrifices she’s made. She resumes her career, directing her focus on an investigation of a 2004 burglary and its connection to her grandmother, Sylvia, and the elusive Night Prowler. Delving into hidden family traumas, Julia discovers layers surrounding her mother's mysterious disappearance.\nIn her journey, Julia confronts her editor, Merv, and explores past ties, notably involving Louise Marshall, uncovering Andrew's influence shaping complex histories. Revitalized professionally, she partners with Oscar, a private investigator, unraveling the enigma of Marianne’s fate. As she navigates time, Julia unveils fragments of her past, observing Sylvia's struggles with overlapping timelines while sensing her grandmother’s protective endeavors. Reflective of emotional stimulations, Julia attempts to alter Alex’s fate once more, confronting the Night Prowler in Chiswick, meeting stark realities about untied relationships and familial links. \nIn a climactic revelation, Julia’s encounter with the Night Prowler interweaves with unveiling Marianne’s truths. Marianne, caught in a time loop, altered history to prevent Julia’s death at the hands of Night Prowler, giving Julia another shot at life. In an emotional plea, Marianne urges Julia to desist from meddling with timelines, urging her to honor her mother’s last wish before Marianne meets her end.\nReturning to her timeline, Julia endeavors to cherish the life she now possesses. She wrestles with the burden of Marianne’s sacrifice amid drastic life shifts. By her 25th birthday, Julia concludes her relationship with Ed and severs ties with her friend Vicky over betrayal amid broader realizations about her life's direction.\nFinding comfort in Sylvia at a care home, Julia reconciles her grief by assuming the role of her mother for Sylvia, who, muddled by Alzheimer’s, mistakes Julia for Marianne, reminding her of the dangerous repercussions of time travel and the significance of letting go.\nAs the narrative unfolds, the epilogue sees Julia back on Hammersmith Bridge a year later, acknowledging Alex’s absence yet embracing the lives still before her. She throws flowers into the river, symbolizing the release of past burdens, resolving never to use the time-travelling necklace again. She embraces her career, having had her article on living with narcolepsy published. Julia acknowledges her growth and newfound independence. However, her encounter with Alex’s art exhibition brings back waves of emotion. Drawn by Hannah, Alex’s niece, Julia is overwhelmed by nostalgia, seeing portraits of her and Alex. Just as she decides to depart, Alex recognizes Julia, articulating enduring feelings and offering a chance to reconnect. Although initially hesitant, their meeting holds the promise of rekindling their bond, signaling newfound beginnings.",
