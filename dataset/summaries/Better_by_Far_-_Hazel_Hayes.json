        "overall_sum": "The protagonist, a reflective writer, navigates personal and creative challenges alongside their familial and romantic histories. Following a breakup with their ex, Finn, and a creative block, they spend Christmas in Colligeen with their father. There, they confront painful truths, particularly concerning their late mother’s battle with early-onset Alzheimer’s and suspicions about the circumstances of her passing. This tumultuous return to their roots amplifies introspection on themes of love, loss, and creativity.\nColligeen serves as a canvas for exploring their mother’s fragmented artistry and familial connections. Tensions mount with their father amid haunting dreams, drawing out the intricacies of grief. The protagonist finds solace in Aunt Kathy, whose cultural insight and support link their grieving to shared heritage and memories. The protagonist’s journey of nostalgia and grief is paralleled by the end of their relationship with Finn, unveiling mixed emotions of hope and longing.\nTheir social circle becomes a bedrock throughout this emotional tumult. Jenna, a close friend, embodies resilience, facing her own challenges, while Fran offers balance and grounding through a theatrical lens. Artistic exploration merges with personal healing through Maeve, an artist who influences the protagonist’s understanding of creativity as intertwined with memory. Maeve’s presence deepens insight into the protagonist’s artistic growth and inherited fears.\nAs a new year dawns, past relationships and deeper introspection unravel the protagonist’s perceptions of identity and love. Encounters with Finn reveal life’s imperfections and encourage the protagonist to see eternal truths within relationships. A visit to Aunt Kathy catalyzes the resolution of unprocessed grief, unveiling their mother’s preserved artworks in a converted art shed, which serves as a testament to her life, emotion, and connection with them across time.\nWith an urge to honor this legacy, the protagonist organizes an exhibition of their mother’s work, transforming sorrow into art and acknowledging their creative lineage. This journey propels them toward acceptance, perceiving grief as an expression of enduring love. These revelations pave the way for a life embraced with intentionality and creativity rather than fate.\nAt a pivotal exhibition event, the artwork is showcased reverse-chronologically to visually narrate the illness’s departure rather than onset, offering a redemptive perspective. The protagonist’s return home encapsulates the blend of exhaustion and fulfillment from the exhibition. A comforting interaction with Jenna highlights not only her support but also sheds light on her health progress.\nA surprise package from Maeve gifts the protagonist with an emotionally charged artwork and an excerpt from Christina Rossetti’s poem, illuminating themes of creation amidst loss. This artwork signifies the beauty within destruction and echoes the protagonist’s journey of grappling with memory and preserving the meaningful fragments of their past. Together with Jenna, they find solace and connection in these newly discovered pieces of memory, underscoring the intertwining of personal growth and relationships with enduring artistic and emotional legacies.",
