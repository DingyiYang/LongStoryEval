        "overall_sum": "Grace Berney, an indefatigable FDA worker, embarks on a harrowing investigation into clandestine time manipulation experiments tied to a portacath designed by Dr. C. P. Stargell. The spark of intrigue comes from a photograph of Ana, a woman believed dead, unraveling a web of deceit surrounding a staged car crash meant to conceal a failed experiment. Despite professional setbacks, including her suspension, Grace tenaciously pursues the truth, supported by her nonbinary child, River. Their discoveries lead them to expose a world where time can be manipulated, materially harvested, and appropriated as a powerful element.\nAna, at the heart of this mystery, navigates fragmented memories to uncover her past, especially concerning her stepfather Martin Ajax's involvement. Her search narrows in on Dr. Stargell on Tilghman Island, where she learns about Stargell's groundbreaking theory of time extraction. A botched experiment meant to extend life results in Ana's alternate reality, where everyone believes her dead. As she grapples with this new reality, hired gun Desiree, whose motives fluctuate between professional loyalty and personal curiosity, hunts Ana under Ajax's command.\nDr. Stargell’s astonishing concept of time as an extractable resource underlies her struggles for recognition within the scientific community, reflecting broader ethical dilemmas. Ajax, whose desperation to prevent his wife's death led to Ana's tragic experiment, concocts a scheme to commercialize time manipulation. This revelation culminates in a dangerous face-off at Ana's hideout, where Ajax's plans for exploiting the durational element collide with Ana's determination for self-preservation.\nIn the pivotal moments at Clare Stargell’s house, Desiree attempts to seize Stargell, seeking personal gain from unraveling the secrets of time manipulation. Grace, ignoring her physical pain and fear, charges at Desiree, thwarting her attempt to kill Ana. Despite being wounded, Grace's timely intervention allows Ana to disarm and fatally wound Desiree.\nSix months later, the fallout from these events unfolds in a congressional hearing where Grace testifies about the unethical experiments. Kathy, Grace's mother, facing the limitations of age after a debilitating car accident, watches proudly yet apprehensively. Her old age and loss give her a prescient view of the future's bleak commercial exploitation of time. Ajax, now in custody awaiting trial, remains unrepentant as he prepares to address Congress, indicating his complicity and calculated involvement in the events now publicly disclosed.",
