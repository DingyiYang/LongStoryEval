She navigates her emerging divine abilities and a mysterious heritage while challenging the oppressive celestial regime. Accompanied by the Darkhaven brothers—Kalix, Theos, and Ruen—she confronts adversities, forming alliances with Regis, among others. Under the scrutiny of the Gods, especially as the Spring Equinox approaches, Kiera confronts the potential revelation of her divine lineage. Her journey is marked by personal and moral dilemmas that develop her resolve against divine control.\nPreviously, in a significant mission in Hollow City, Kiera saved Regis from slavery, showcasing her transition from a marginalized mortal to a key challenger of divine dominance. Regis, initially a rival, evolves into an ally amidst hardships that bind them.\nIn the present, Kiera and Ruen uncover perilous secrets about the Academy. Regis reveals an attack involving unrecognizable, perhaps manipulated, men linked to divine schemes. Ruen finds evidence—a ledger charting Mortal Gods' deaths—hinting at a conspiracy tied to Ortus, the original academy. Ruen’s confrontation with Azai, his supposed father, underscores his struggle for independence.\nKiera and Ruen suspect grand divine designs threatening their existence, prompting thoughts of fleeing to the Hinterlands, free of celestial oversight. As the truth unfolds, the stakes heighten—both must act decisively to shield their friends and confront looming threats.\nRecent chapters thrust Kiera and the Darkhavens into an arena gathered by the Gods. The foreboding atmosphere suggests divine intimidation. The conspicuous absence of servant Terra, and the presence of only the head Terra, Dauphine and Hael, raises suspicions about the Gods' motives. Tryphone, the God King, disturbingly addresses the assembly while Kiera becomes inexplicably distressed, her whispers warning of death and entrapment. Ruen reveals the Gods' plan to send students to Ortus Academy, a decision shrouded in danger due to unfolding events.\nKiera grapples with a psychic invasion by Tryphone, unveiling an ominous revelation. She relays to the Darkhavens the Gods' lethal secret: consuming their own offspring, the Mortal Gods, to sustain their power. The disclosure that Caedmon is dead adds gravitas to their plight, burdening them with horrifying truths as they face their impending journey to Ortus Academy. The story accelerates toward a confrontation with divine forces, demanding Kiera harness her strength and alliances to challenge celestial tyranny.",
