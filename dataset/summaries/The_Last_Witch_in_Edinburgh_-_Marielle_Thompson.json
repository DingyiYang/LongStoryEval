        "overall_sum": "Nellie Duncan, once a witch in old Edinburgh, survived historical witch hunts by assuming discreet roles and mastering herbalism under the guidance of the Rae Women’s Apothecary. Forming close bonds with Mary and Jean Rae, Nellie found solace in their sisterhood against societal oppression. However, threats from Lady MacDonald forced her to flee, leaving her friends’ fates unknown. After years in seclusion, Nellie transformed into an artist, distancing herself from witchcraft. Rachel and her daughter Chani reintroduced hope into her life, with Nellie taking on a maternal role after Rachel’s tragic demise. Returning to Edinburgh for Chani’s education, past unresolved conflicts resurfaced. Nellie discovered Jean Rae, her past lover, alive but harboring resentment for perceived abandonment. As they rekindled their bond, they confronted Angus, the embodiment of oppressive patriarchy masquerading as Vice-Chancellor Donoghue. Following Chani's assault, Nellie and Jean battled against the entrenched abuses of power, rallying allies, including Jean's daughters Fiona and Nora.\nThe violence escalated, notably with Catherine Baker’s murder. Nellie and Jean used art as resistance, inspiring young women to create \"You Are Not Alone\" in the Meadows, challenging Angus's legacy and honoring Catherine. Despite Angus’s oppressive measures, like curfews, Nellie drew strength from collective resistance. A student video exposing Angus's culpability in setting a fire spurred mass protests demanding his resignation. The protests grew beyond the university, unifying Edinburgh citizens against systemic injustices. Nellie learned the broader struggle lay in challenging persistent societal norms, rallying to confront Angus and emphasize his diminishing power. The collective action marked the waning of his tyrannical grip on the city.\nIn the epilogue, Nellie and Chani reflect on the victories, however partial, from a scenic crag in Edinburgh. Nellie embraces the community’s role in Angus’s resignation and prepares to advocate for Chani, ensuring her past struggles create a brighter future. Reunited with her past haunts, Nellie finds a renewed sense of peace and belonging. She reaches out to Jean Rae, signaling a readiness to nurture lasting change and a more equitable world.",
