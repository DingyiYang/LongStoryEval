        "overall_sum": "The story follows Violet \"Liv\" Whitlock, who assumes her twin sister Everly's identity to escape into a new life via a prestigious writing internship. On a yacht with celebrities, including actress Paris Grace, siblings Effie and Miri Knight, former Olympic athlete Rosa Torres, influencer Celia Jones, and enigmatic producer Vincent Bellegarde, their journey becomes surreal when they're stranded on a mysterious island after a shipwreck. With limited resources, they deal with inner tensions, maintaining unity despite Vincent's disappearance.\nThe island is harsh and supernatural; Rosa's injury enhances her swimming, while Liv's wounds transform into growths. Liv steps into leadership, confronting fears and existential questions about identity. They find a military bunker with supplies and messages hinting at madness, serving as refuge amidst isolation. Performances by Celia provide cultural relief. Salvaging unity, Effie's skepticism and Miri’s belief in a monstrous creature create tension.\nAs Liv and Miri grow closer, the island’s ethereal beauty bonds them. Then, Miri is injured through sleepwalking, and Celia vanishes, heightening danger. Miri later shows new wings, and Celia develops fangs; injuries signify survival transformations. The creature, more empathetic than hostile, appears as a potential warning of deeper threats. Effie reveals Vincent's scheme to stage a media rescue went awry with his death, renewing motivation to repair communication systems.\nNine months later, they adapt to island life, embracing new strengths. The creature seems less threatening, offering protective signs. The group's bond deepens, mirroring resilience. Liv’s leadership grows, guiding survival tactics and fostering an acceptance that their changes build resilience.\nIn the epilogue, Effie disappears, found near a creature's lair. Liv discovers her with gills, saving her from drowning. Welcoming Effie back, they fear a repeat incident. Miri disappears next, found on a cliff edge, intent on flying. Though a crosswind brings her down, she survives when the creature sacrifices itself in an empathetic act that resonates with Liv. Returning to civilization, they are seen as cult figures, but Liv and Miri merge past traumas with a new acceptance of self. The group remains bound by their unique history.",
