Beatriz, an empyrea with significant magical abilities, strategically forms alliances in Cellaria, avoiding an unwanted marriage proposal, and rallies an army to besiege Hapantoile. Meanwhile, Daphne conducts covert resistance efforts in Bessemia, secretly allying within Margaraux's court. In Temarin, King Leopold and Violie gather forces, their bond deepening as they join the rebellion against Bessemian tyranny.\nBeatriz, alongside Pasquale and former adversary Nicolo, navigates political and mystical challenges to gain support, arriving at Hapantoile, where Daphne, undeterred by surveillance, is motivated by their reunion to overthrow their mother. The plot climaxes at Nemaria Woods, where Beatriz plans a decisive battle, knowing her magic's high personal cost. Daphne relies on cunning alliances and growing affection for Bairre in hopes of achieving peace.\nA turn of events sees Violie, Leopold, Beatriz, and Pasquale ambushed, resulting in the capture of Beatriz and Pasquale, supervised by the enigmatic Adilla. Yet, Cliona, although captured, helps Daphne, indicating her conflicted loyalties. In a daring rescue, Violie, Leopold, and Bairre liberate allies, with plans to use Beatriz’s powers as the last resort.\nThe resolution occurs in catacombs, where Daphne and Beatriz combat Margaraux’s schemes. Cliona aids Daphne, handing her a dagger to face their mother. Though victorious in this struggle, Daphne is gravely injured, prompting Beatriz to self-sacrifice, healing her sister at the cost of her own life. Beatriz, however, gets another chance at life through Sophronia's transcendence, who replaces the sun with her essence, resolving the temporary chaos of its absence.\nWith Beatriz revived, the rebellion triumphs but with personal losses. Daphne reluctantly becomes Empress Daphne, yearning to return to Friv amid the burden of leadership. As Beatriz and Violie refuse to assume the throne, the three reach a consensus on a cooperative governance model, distributing the responsibilities of ruling Bessemia among them. With Beatriz as the titular empress, the friends commit to supporting each other within their respective roles, ushering in an era of hope and potential peace in Vesteria.",
