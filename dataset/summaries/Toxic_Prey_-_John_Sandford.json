        "overall_sum": "Dr. Lionel Scott, once a humanitarian, morphs into a determined eco-terrorist, aiming to incite global ecological consciousness by releasing a deadly hybrid virus. Under the leadership of U.S. Marshal Lucas Davenport, a crisis response unit converges on Taos, New Mexico, aiming to thwart Scott's bioterrorism plans. Deputy Marshal Rae Givens and sniper Barbara Cartwright are instrumental in initial successes within Santa Fe and Taos against Scott's radical associates like Randall Foss and Clarice Catton. Despite these interventions, panic escalates as military-police checkpoints fail to capture Scott, who utilizes disguises and night movements to stay ahead.\nClarice tries to execute her viral attack but fails to complete her contamination plan before being taken down, consequently triggering mass containment measures at a church she targeted. Scott, learning of his partner’s failure, evades checkpoints once more by leveraging stealth and violence, securing transport through an isolated police murder in Lamy. Preparing for potential mass infection at major hubs like Albuquerque Airport, U.S. Marshals Letty and British operative Alec Hawkins are tasked with tracking Scott’s presumed trajectory.\nWith critical decisions hinging on Scott's next move, things culminate at Albuquerque airport. Anticipating Scott's ploy, Letty and Hawkins confront him in a climactic standoff, which ends with Scott's death. Despite their success, they become contaminated with the virus, forcing an urgent response to mitigate the spread. Drawing on quarantine protocols coordinated by Underwood, the virus specialist, they advance to the heavily guarded church area to avoid further exposure.\nWithin this fortified containment area, the mood shifts from tense to grim. Letty and Hawkins, along with hundreds of potentially infected citizens, face an impending biological threat. They navigate the dual battle of disease management and emotional toll as they watch the outbreak unfold around them. Despite the gravity, they engage in intimate human moments amidst the chaos. As disease specialists and health workers depend on global assistance and experimental treatments, the pair persists, recovering with other survivors while witnessing the tragic scale of the virus.\nUltimately, the destruction of the affected zone, including its facilities and the historical church infrastructure, underscores the gravity of the virus's impact. As Lucas confirms the containment's success, even as the loss of lives remains heavy, both Letty and Hawkins emerge with resolve. The national and international implications mark a notable collaborative success against eco-terrorism. In recognition, Hawkins is awarded the George Cross for his valor.",
