        "overall_sum": "In an alternate urban fantasy setting, the story follows Kierse, a master thief with a unique ability to absorb magic, on a quest to rescue her friend Torra from King Louis. This mission introduces her to New York’s supernatural underworld, involving ancient mythic conflicts and concealed truths. Kierse teams up with Graves, a powerful warlock and the historical Holly King, to challenge King Louis’s ambitions of acquiring the Spear of Lugh for his own schemes.\nKierse’s journey leads her to a dangerous heist designed to undermine King Louis's plans, all amidst moral complexities involving Dr. Mafi, bound to Louis through blood contracts. Their successful heist at King Louis's estate during the winter solstice exposes his true agenda and fosters revelation of deep-rooted connections between Kierse and Graves, entangled in mythological cycles and prophecies.\nAs their victory becomes clouded with new tension, Kierse confronts Lorcan Flynn, an adversary embodying the Oak King myth. This rivalry reveals ancient ties and rivalries between Lorcan and Graves, rooted in seasonal lore dictating power dynamics. Kierse discovers her destiny as a will-o-the-wisp, the last of her kind, expanding her powers dramatically. Yet, her newfound abilities risk destabilizing alliances as Kierse’s latent powers brush against Lorcan’s rise in power.\nIn a climactic battle, Kierse, overwhelmed by divine magic, attempts the impossible—channeling the energy into Graves to survive. In desperation, friends Gen and Ethan merge their burgeoning abilities with hers, forming a triskel, a critical element in Fae mythology, mitigating the overwhelming magic and stabilizing Kierse. This act solidifies her strength and unity with her companions, deepening her involvement in the mythic narrative.\nIn the aftermath of these dramatic events, Kierse confronts new resolutions. She survives Wren Day in New York, determined to explore her path in unveiling her Fae heritage. Guided by renewed resolve, Kierse opts to explore her destiny independently, inspired by Lorcan and Graves's insights toward Dublin's Goblin Market, though wary of their motivations. Meanwhile, Ethan embarks on his druid path with Lorcan, supported by Kierse and Gen, despite their concerns.\nThe narrative shifts focus momentarily to Graves, who grapples with Kierse's absence and his incomplete magical quest, heightening his sense of loss and failure over both the necessary artifacts and Kierse, the woman who has sundered him. Amidst frustration, an unexpected call from an old ally, Laz, reignites Graves’s hope with a lead on the cauldron, shedding light on a new opportunity. Realizing Kierse’s crucial role for the anticipated mission, Graves considers how to reconnect with her and seeks resolution in the ongoing hunt for magical artifacts. ",
