Initially a captive in the Moon Court, she contends with memories of past lives and complex relationships, especially with King Hadeon. Her path is marked by unlocking powers linked to bloodstone artifacts and fulfilling a looming prophecy. Supported by her brothers Leander and Elion, alongside allies like Celani and Kallius, Ember confronts the threat of Valandril and the shadow wraiths.\nGuided by Abba, a divine mentor, Ember becomes a pivotal force in Aelvaria's destiny. Alongside Hadeon, they navigate through the mythical Never Court's curses, solidifying their unity. Their return halts in an inn, recuperating Nyx, Ember's cerberus, and strategizing against the wraiths' menace. Through Chapters Thirty-Eight and onward, Ember's family dynamics and prophecies center around unifying the Moon and Sun Courts. A combined army undertakes a mission against a malevolent source within the Never Court.\nChapter Forty captures the climactic battle against the wraiths and a malicious entity known as the Source. Strategic advancements, deceit, and familial tensions strain alliances, culminating in a pivotal confrontation where Ember and Hadeon's united powers nearly vanquish the malice before Hadeon is critically injured.\nIn Chapter Forty-One, desperation grips Ember as Hadeon faces a mortal wound from malice. She summons Abba, who reluctantly restores Hadeon, acknowledging their mutual love's power. Chapter Forty-Two rounds off the narrative with the aftermath, showcasing healing, new dynamics among the courts, and interpersonal bonds healing with time. The story peaks as Ember prepares for her coronation as queen. Despite inner insecurities, Hadeon reassures her, and she rises to the occasion. The coronation signifies peace between the courts, solidified by mutual support and her acceptance as Queen Ember.
