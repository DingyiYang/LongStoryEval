The story begins with an accidental imprinting between Shloka and Kritik, binding them in a connection that vampire tradition mandates can only be resolved through marriage. Shloka struggles with familial pressures and expectations as she grapples with her past relationship with Kritik, which ended abruptly and mysteriously.\nSet in the grandeur of the Iyer mansion, Shloka's family—spearheaded by her father, Appa—must reconcile cultural expectations with vampire customs, such as blood hunts and family duties. Despite her reluctance and internal conflict, Shloka acquiesces to the arranged marriage, which merges historical animosity with present-day responsibilities. Integral themes of autonomy, cultural commitment, and family loyalty are explored as Shloka reunites with Kritik.

Her father's rare show of emotion during the 'giving away' ceremony symbolizes a deeper familial reconciliation and the complex interplay of authority and affection.\nWith the wedding culminating in emotional reflection, Shloka reassesses her feelings for Kritik and her desires outside of familial expectations. The plot is interspersed with non-linear narratives highlighting the complexities of familial pressure and love's transformational journey.\nIn the epilogue, the season's end brings a quiet moment as Shloka returns home, satisfied and reflecting on the love-filled weddings she witnessed.
