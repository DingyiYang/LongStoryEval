        "overall_sum": "Adena, a talented seamstress from the slums of Loot, has cunningly integrated herself into the palace's complex environment to support her close friend Paedyn during the prestigious yet perilous Purging Trials. These Trials offer significant political leverage and the possibility of royal marriage, specifically to Prince Kitt. Adena skillfully navigates the palace intrigues, forming alliances and securing Paedyn’s advancement through her resourceful nature.\nMeanwhile, Makoto, a blacksmith from Ilya burdened by guilt over the death of Hera, a fellow Trial participant, possesses secret Wielder abilities. His journey toward self-forgiveness and understanding is intricately linked with his growing emotional bond with Adena. Together, they strengthen each other's resolve, forming a deep connection based on trust and shared aspirations.\nAs the Trials progress, Adena’s sudden incarceration becomes a pivotal event without explicit justification. Her imprisonment breaks her fingers, rendering her craft skills useless, yet showcases her indomitable spirit as she interacts with Al, another prisoner. This arc highlights her undying hope and resilience even in the bleakest circumstances.\nDuring the climactic final Purging Trial, Makoto’s worst fears materialize as Adena is placed in the Pit as a target. Enveloped by the roaring crowd and ominous arena, his only focus is ensuring Adena's safety. Despite believing in Paedyn's ability to save Adena, the Trial takes a tragic turn when Adena is mistakenly but fatally injured before Paedyn can intervene. Adena accepts her fate peacefully, leaving behind heartfelt sentiments for Paedyn and Makoto, encapsulating her spirit of love and resilience.\nIn a preceding flashback from Prince Kai's viewpoint, insights into his inner conflict between royal duties and personal emotions unfold. Kai, who appreciated Paedyn’s uniqueness, is portrayed as a supportive figure who grapples with his identity as both a prince and the Enforcer. The prologue reveals a tradition of solitude and reflection, where on Adena's birthday, Kai collects a bun from Gail, his surrogate mother figure, and visits a willow tree in the garden to honor Adena’s memory.",
