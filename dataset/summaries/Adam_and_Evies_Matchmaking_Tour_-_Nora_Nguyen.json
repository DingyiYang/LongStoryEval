        "overall_sum": "Evie Lang, a Vietnamese American poet, joins the Love Yêu Tours in Việt Nam, aiming to reconnect with her roots while honoring her late Auntie Hảo. During the tour, she falls for Adam Quyền, a tour organizer, amidst challenges with his family, primarily Mr. Quyền, Adam's father. Adam juggles duties at his sister Ruby's startup with growing affections for Evie, leading to a confession of love in Hội An. Evie’s career fears cause her to leave Adam and return to San Francisco, even as her poetry gains recognition.\nStateside, Evie works to preserve Auntie Hảo’s Victorian home, longing for Adam, and mending ties with her mother, Grace. Fueled by memories and lessons from Auntie Hảo, she reaffirms her love for Adam. Meanwhile, Adam is heartbroken by Evie's departure, but spurred by advice from his grandmother Bà Nội, he resolves to pursue Evie. Ruby, managing Love Yêu and coping with her own marital issues, advises Adam to find happiness beyond family obligations. A chance encounter with ex-girlfriend Lana in Hồ Chí Minh City leads Adam to confront his relationship barriers further. A pivotal letter from Evie prompts him to reevaluate past choices.\nAs Evie visits Little Saigon, nostalgic for Vietnam, she consults psychic Bà Oanh, who prompts her to courageously face her regrets. This pushes her toward fulfilling Auntie Hảo's vision of an artist's retreat. Reconnected, Adam visits Evie, expressing his unwavering love and commitment to their future. They abandon old fears, welcoming a shared life and collaboration, turning Auntie Hảo’s home into Cabinet of Curiosities, a burgeoning arts retreat.\nA year later, Adam and Evie lead a tour to Phong Nha Caves in Việt Nam, now married and contemplating purchasing a home there. The retreats have excelled, born of Evie's own experiences, offering creative rest and nurturing community. With his recent financial gains from Love Yêu, they maintain a relaxed schedule to focus on personal projects. Evie's poetry and ongoing memoir earn praise, and she often collaborates with Grace. Adam, content in his romantic and professional fulfillment, dreams with Evie about a family, expanded retreats, and a vibrant artistic haven, confident about their shared journey into an uncertain yet promising future.",
