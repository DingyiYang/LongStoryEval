        "overall_sum": "The narrative of Jude and Kat Bird oscillates between 1977 and 1984, underlining themes of complex familial relationships and the quest for liberation. Initially, Jude's entanglement with King Bash's cult outlines a story characterized by infiltration and internal rebellion. Genesis's death and strain with Violet add complexity to Jude's motivations against \"The Plan,\" which involves violent acts and indifferent manipulation of their past identities.\nIn 1983, Kat suffers a tragic accident, erasing her memory. As she reconstructs her life through Jude's selective retelling, Kat unravels truths about their violent history, challenging the confines Jude set through deception. This new self-awareness strains Kat's romance with Sab and her connection with Jude. Sab represents an avenue for Kat's newfound independence, but unresolved cult obligations continue to enmesh the sisters.\nAs Kat tries to reclaim agency, she befriends Richard, formerly King Bash, linking her to their troubled past. By October 1983, Kat avows a desire to separate from Jude's manipulative shadows by reshaping her identity, escaping the clandestine obligations with Richard’s unintentional guidance, and insights into their family provided by Verona.\nEight months post-accident, in November 1983, the sisters plan an ultimate confrontation with Richard at his house. Jude stealthily follows Kat, despite promises to stay away. Inside, Richard initially cooperates with Kat before revealing he is aware of their plan. Much to their shock, he apologizes and takes his own life, marking a pivotal moment of the sisters confronting their deeply buried past.\nThe narrative shifts to 1984, chronicling Jude's reflections on the one-year anniversary of Kat's life-altering accident. The sisters celebrate personal gains and liberation. They confront Verona, their mother, and declare their autonomy from lifelong shadows defined by the cult and family dysfunction. A transformative scene involves tattooing arrows over old scars, symbolizing their forward trajectory. Jude’s thoughts conclude the narrative, expressing optimism for her and Kat’s evolving identities—After Kat and After Jude—while cherishing the simple pleasures that signify their journey toward freedom and self-discovery.",
