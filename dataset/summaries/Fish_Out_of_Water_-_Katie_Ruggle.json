Skeptical locals and difficult terrain challenge her quest, but with Winston Dane, a reclusive author with a mysterious past, at her side, they begin a journey that becomes as much about personal discovery and burgeoning romance as it is about locating Rose. Dahlia and Winston’s partnership deepens as they navigate the wild, deciphering clues to Rose's whereabouts from an uncharted map. Winston's military background proves invaluable as they face various physical and emotional trials, fostering trust and emotional connections.\nTheir journey leads them to a suspicious structure, which they deduce to be linked to illicit drug activities.
