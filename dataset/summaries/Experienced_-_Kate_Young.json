        "overall_sum": "By December, Bette is engulfed in her busiest period at work, juggling long hours due to covering events for a colleague on honeymoon. Amid this professional chaos, she navigates personal complexities, attempting to maintain connections with her partner Ash and family, particularly her nonna. Her loneliness compels her to seek community at a queer meet-up, where she encounters Heather, reigniting emotional turbulence from her unresolved relationship with Ruth. Heather reveals that Ruth is also struggling emotionally, prompting Bette to reconsider keeping her distance. Ash, ever supportive, helps Bette process her emotions, encouraging her to confront Ruth.\nDuring a Christmas gathering organized by Ash, Bette experiences the supportive embrace of her friends and realizes the need to take action concerning Ruth. Encouragement from her circle of friends propels her to express her feelings directly to Ruth, leading to an impromptu plan to declare them at Portishead Beach. Despite Ruth’s initial reluctance, she joins Bette, resulting in a vulnerable exchange of feelings that sees Ruth choosing to metaphorically jump alongside Bette into their relationship. This moment marks a significant step in their reconciliation, leaving Bette hopeful for their future.\nAs New Year’s Eve arrives, Bette and her friends partake in Ash’s cherished tradition of writing down twelve hopes for the upcoming year. During this, Bette reflects on her relationship with Ruth and the changes she desires in her life, such as taking a walking holiday with Ruth, visiting her nonna regularly, and planning a future with Ash. She realizes her longing to become a present and supportive figure in her family’s life and envisions achieving these goals in the coming year. As the evening progresses towards midnight, they plan to burn the discarded hopes and internalize the one paper each person keeps. In a moment of intimacy as the fireworks begin, Bette finally shares with Ruth that her last year’s resolution was to fall in love and be together. Ruth reciprocates the sentiment, solidifying their renewed relationship and mutual hopes for the future.",
