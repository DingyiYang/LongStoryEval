        "overall_sum": "In Tal Abisi, during the Festival of the Clockwork King, Eveen, an undead assassin, is faced with her true test when Sky, believed to be her younger self, is pulled 60 years into the future. Defying her guild's contract to kill Sky, Eveen chooses protection over execution as they uncover the sinister plot of Patriarch Pol Oranus, who holds a deep-seated grudge against Eveen for her past actions against his son. Pol orchestrates a magical contract designed to ensure Eveen's death by exploiting temporal vulnerabilities, intending to eliminate her through Sky.\nTheir pursuit reveals complex family ties and political scheming, with allies like Baseema shedding light on Oranus's manipulative strategies. Ignoring guild protocols, Eveen seeks out Mael, a thaumaturgist from the Edgelords, aiming to utilize the city's Shimmer energy to return Sky home. Mael’s demise and a battle with Valesh, an undead guild enforcer, in the Shimmer temporarily restore Eveen’s humanity. With Sky's clever intervention, they defeat Valesh.\nBack at the guild, Eveen narrowly avoids destruction via necromantic spells with aid from the enigmatic Old Man, who is captivated by her defiance of the oppressive guild system. Granting them freedom to directly challenge Oranus, the Old Man watches as Eveen's strategic defiance unfolds. The confrontation reveals Oranus's intricate web of deceit, leading to a divine arbitration with Aeril, the Matron of Assassins, whose arrival validates the intricate contract's legality. However, a twist arises when Sky, hailing from a parallel world, challenges established divine laws.\nIn Chapter Nine, Sky summons a second Aeril from another reality. Both goddesses are nearly identical, yet immediately ready for confrontation over their claimed rights. Eveen intervenes with a fabricated story, invoking \"Asheel the Maniac Hunter\" as a metaphor to dissuade them from infighting. Her persuasiveness avoids impending divine violence, and both goddesses agree to nullify the contract on Eveen, recognizing manipulation. Sky secures Eveen’s future by negotiating away her extended punishment, showcasing her growth and resolve.\nSky then audaciously hires Eveen’s guild to 'ship' Pol Oranus using a rare token from her world, leading to his demise at the hands of the goddesses. Knowing she will return to her time without memory of these events, Sky closes the chapter with newfound insight and a promise of choice, affirming both Eveen's and her own significant futures.",
