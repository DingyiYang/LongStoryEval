Despite being engaged to Princess Leeri of Nimbiss, Senan desires a life with Allette, navigating treacherous court intrigues and the chokehold of family expectations. Amidst false accusations and misunderstandings, their commitment is tested as the kingdom's corruption looms large.\nSenan and Allette's tumultuous relationship is further strained by the scheming of Mari, who betrays Senan, leading to Allette's imprisonment. Forced into a marriage to ensure Allette's safety, Senan utilizes an impromptu ceremony with Leeri as a stalling tactic. Meanwhile, Jeston, initially seen as a suspect, reveals loyalty by helping Senan with antidotes, significantly influencing shifting allegiances.\nAllette, having been kept in a dark cell underground, wishes desperately for Senan's understanding and forgiveness, fearing he believes she abandoned him. Her solitude is interrupted by Eason, a man from her past. Eason claims he's rescuing her but his actions reveal ulterior motives. He uses news of Senan's marriage to Leeri to manipulate Allette, although his deceit soon unravels, showing his betrayal and manipulation. Rising conflicts unveil his deeper involvement in plotting against Senan.\nSenan's arrival to save Allette results in a brutal fight against Eason, who turns out to be a formidable royal guard. Allette, in a show of bravery, incapacitates Eason, creating an opportunity for their escape. However, their path to freedom is quickly obstructed by King Boris and his guards. Despite Senan’s attempts, the king's ruthlessness sees Senan punished by the loss of his wings, a horrific act marking him as a traitor to the crown. \nIn a climactic moment, Allette watches in horror as Senan, incapacitated and weakened by blood loss from his severed wings, is thrown into a portal by the king’s guards—actions that underline King Boris's authoritarian and merciless reign. Despite the dire situation, Allette, driven by her love for Senan, makes a desperate leap after him into the abyss, challenging the oppressive monarchy and illustrating the power of love in the face of tyranny.",
