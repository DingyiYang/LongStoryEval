        "overall_sum": "The story is set in a realm where divine forces shape the lives of mortals through seasonal rituals, governed by the Mirror of a divine hierarchy. Tirne, the protagonist and former Herald of Autumn, is cast into turmoil as she navigates the spiritual and political conflicts within her community. Initially mired in divine responsibility, Tirne is removed from her role amidst intrigues and finds herself accused of a crime she didn't commit. As she battles external accusations and internal doubts, Tirne's journey is compounded by her ties with Sidriel, a sorcerer whose motivations intertwine with her fate, and Autumn, her divine patron whose once distant demeanor becomes intimately familiar.\nTirne's escape from the Temple exposes her to different beliefs through her Aunt Ilna, which challenges her understanding of divinity and mortality. With Ilna's death, Tirne is propelled into deeper conflict with the Temple's machinations. Betrayed by Bix, a former ally and hidden deity Kild, she grapples with complex alliances and escapes assassination during a ritual meant to mend the shattered Mirror. The ritual results in her divine blood being severed, freeing her from Autumn's grasp but leaving her to confront unresolved feelings and pursuit of identity.\nOver time, Tirne undergoes healing and self-discovery, aided by Jaed, an emotional anchor amidst fractured trust. As the seasons change, the narrative explores her confrontations with Sidriel and Autumn, culminating in a bittersweet farewell as Vanyse takes on her former role as Herald. Though separated from Autumn's tangible influence, Tirne finds strength in friendships with Jaed, Feryn, and Vanyse, accepting their support and shared experiences.\nIn the restored cycle of seasons, Tirne faces Sidriel to finally close a painful chapter of unfulfilled affections and promises. Through these encounters, she realizes the multiplicity of love's hold on her heart, acknowledging connections that persist despite change and distance. As Autumn chooses Feryn as his Consort, Tirne embraces the stability her friendships provide and resolves to live independently of divine control. Her acceptance of the heart’s resilience and potential for rejuvenation signifies an enduring cycle of life and emotion beyond divine interference.",
