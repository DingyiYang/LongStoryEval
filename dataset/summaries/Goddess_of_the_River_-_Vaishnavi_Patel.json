        "overall_sum": "The story weaves through the realms of divine and mortal with focus on Ganga, a river deity, and her son, Bhishma. Fulfilling a celestial prophecy, Ganga enters the human world, navigating her son’s adherence to martial vows, which stir political frictions in Hastinapur. Despite her attempts to avert disaster, she becomes entangled in the destinies of characters like Kunti and Karna, seeking reconciliation amidst an inevitable war.\nAs Prince Duryodhana and Shakuni’s plots against the Kuru dynasty materialize, Bhishma faces moral dilemmas, exacerbated by his resolute vows. Despite Krishna’s peace efforts, Karna’s allegiance to Duryodhana marks the relentless advance of conflict, resistant even to divine affairs.\nOn the battlefield, Bhishma wrestles with conflicting duties; his pledges become destructive chains. His silence over past injustices, including Draupadi's humiliation, pricks his conscience. Confiding in Krishna, Yudhishthira, and Arjuna, Bhishma entrusts them with exploiting his vulnerability to Shikhandi, facilitating a predestined conclusion to the war through sacrifice.\nAs Bhishma forgoes combat with Shikhandi, bound by a past vow, his demise signifies the profundity of justice and redemption. Parallel to these events, Ganga contemplates her interventions, aligning her divine essence with human experiences, choosing to remain a guardian of humanity’s strife-torn survivors and their solace-seeking in her waters.\nKrishna’s guidance pendant amid chaos reflects divine justice through human agency, culminating in Duryodhana’s defeat, which uncovers personal and societal costs of this battle. Yudhishthira, grappling with remorse over Karna’s death, redefines their purpose in family bonds overlooked amid war’s brutality, embracing truth and responsibility.\nBhishma’s concluding moments usher Yudhishthira into regal duty, settling his internal crisis over the throne he perceives marred with deeds of war. Bhishma’s wisdom aids Yudhishthira, nurturing his leadership spirit after learning harsh truths, weaving his path in justice amid ruin.\nGanga, nurturing Bhishma even in death, learns the intricacies of mortal ties whilst accepting change. Her autonomy surfaces as she chooses to witness human endurance. Invoking her cosmic origins, she assures an eternal solvent existence amidst terrestrial trials.\nThe narrative’s resolve harmonizes Bhishma’s valiant demise with Ganga’s ethereal wisdom, portraying humanity’s resurgence and journey through adversity. Through Ganga and Bhishma’s arcs, the tale embodies divine oversight, surviving legacies, and a transformative promise towards equilibrium.",
