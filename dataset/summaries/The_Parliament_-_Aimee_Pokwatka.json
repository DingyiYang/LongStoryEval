Alala, once silenced by a monster, joins forces with other girls to reclaim her voice and liberate her kingdom. Their victory, marked by a powerful cry of resistance, faces the challenge of acclimating to a kingdom transformed by their actions. As they journey through winter landscapes, Alala’s story intertwines with those of her companions, each grappling with identity and loss.\nParallel to Alala, Mad Purdy confronts chaos in her hometown, plagued by predatory owls and personal grief over her brother's death. Balancing community leadership, Mad, with Nash's assistance, orchestrates a strategic response, mirroring Alala’s courage. As connections deepen amid turmoil, Mad's personal growth, analogous to Alala's, emerges through community resilience.\nThe narrative shifts back to Alala, navigating the post-Great Shattering world.

Support from Duck and magical plants suggests a path toward equilibrium between duty and well-being.\nAs both narratives converge, Alala and Mad illustrate leadership through trials. Alala guides her kingdom to a thriving future, her growth reflected in deepening bonds with Duck. Meanwhile, Mad confronts her past, paralleling external challenges, revealing her courage in fostering communal hope.\nThe current segment elaborates on Mad's personal journey post-turmoil, now back in a familiar setting, reconnecting with her community by teaching a class.
