        "overall_sum": "In the suburb of Palmetto, the disappearance of Becca, the best friend of protagonist Nora, triggers a series of mysterious and supernatural events. Nora is drawn into a web of intrigue, investigating the strange behavior of classmates and their connection to Miss Ekstrom, a teacher with a complex past. The narrative intertwines present-day events with a historical flashback to the 1960s when a young Miss Ekstrom, then named Rita, lived under societal constraints while having a forbidden relationship with Patty. Following Patty's mysterious death and subsequent rebellion against school authority figures, Ekstrom became an agent for a supernatural goddess tasked with vanquishing perceived evil. The goddess's presence persists into modern times, impacting Becca and, eventually, Nora.\nNora uncovers the dark truth about Becca's disappearanceâ€”she was nearly possessed by the goddess through an arcane ritual led by Ekstrom. Though the possession fails to fully claim Becca, it leaves her trapped in another realm. During this ordeal, she's temporarily freed at night and leaves Nora elusive messages to play the \"goddess game.\" Eventually, Nora confronts the entity herself, becoming a vessel for the goddess's wrath against those deemed evil. Despite the oppressive control of the supernatural force, Nora manages to banish the entity using the emotional depth of her connection with Becca.\nFollowing these events, Becca mysteriously returns, though their ordeal has indelibly changed both friends. Becca recounts the profound experience of being in a surreal, infinite house that her mind created for protection while being entwined with the goddess. Her return is marked by unique otherworldly signs, like growing unusual teeth and silver-white hair. As Becca recovers at the hospital, she and Nora tentatively navigate the ramifications of their supernatural experiences, with Becca gradually revealing details to Nora. The girls' bond deepens as they share these confessions, drawing solace and understanding from each other.\nMeanwhile, Nora's relationship with James flourishes, offering her a reprieve from the traumatic events. As she balances her connections with Becca and James, Nora recognizes the lingering effects of the goddess's influence and her emotional journey toward healing and acceptance. The story ends with a hopeful note, suggesting potential recovery and a brighter future despite their shared past of supernatural encounters and personal loss.",
