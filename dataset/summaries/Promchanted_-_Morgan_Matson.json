        "overall_sum": "Stella, a pragmatic high schooler, unexpectedly enters the world of \"Sleeping Beauty\" with her classmate Reece during a Disneyland visit. Tasked with ensuring the fairy tale's proper conclusion, they encounter Briar Rose (secretly Princess Aurora) and Prince Phil, who is unaware of Rose's true identity. Stella and Reece must navigate this enchanted world, foster bonds with Rose and Phil, and ensure that Aurora awakens from her sleep with true love's kiss to break Maleficent's curse.\nInitially, Stella and Reece struggle to influence the narrative, meeting challenges posed by Maleficent's looming threats. Despite this, they adapt to their environment and aid Phil in courting Rose, sometimes manipulating the story to ensure the necessary outcomes. As events climax, Phil confesses his love for Rose, leading to a heartfelt reconciliation and an engagement between Aurora and Phil in their real identities. This fulfillment of the narrative breaks the curse and allows for the story's closure.\nThroughout these challenges, Stella’s relationships deepen, particularly with Reece, whose feelings for her develop further. Conversely, Reece is drawn to the promise and allure of the fairy tale's certainty and initially decides to remain in this magical world. Despite her heartbreak, Stella accepts the complexities and unpredictability of real life, returning home with newfound belief in fairy tales and the bonds she’s formed during her journey.\nThe story culminates as Stella finds herself back at Disneyland, grappling with her experiences and the vibrant reality of modern life. Her reconnection with friends like Nisha and Allyson helps her transition, though the loss of Reece continues to weigh heavily. However, Reece unexpectedly appears on horseback, having persuaded the fairies to unite him with Stella, underlying that despite narratives ending, their tale and love are just beginning together in the real world. This moment highlights both Stella and Reece's transformations and their readiness to embrace the uncertain but exciting adventure of life beyond a scripted fairy tale.",
