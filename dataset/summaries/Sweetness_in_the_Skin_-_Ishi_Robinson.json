        "overall_sum": "Pumkin Patterson, a young girl from Kingston, Jamaica, aspires to escape her neglected home life with her mother Paulette by moving to France with her Aunt Sophie. Despite economic struggles, she channels her hope into baking, selling pastries to fund her escape. Supported by Miss Keene, her French tutor, and family friend Boots, Pumkin endeavours to succeed despite setbacks such as betrayals from her friend Tamara regarding her burgeoning business. Pumkin’s attempts to raise exam fees are further complicated by school intervention, but with community support, she presses on and eventually completes her exams.\nTensions escalate as Paulette’s jealousy toward Sophie becomes destructive, ultimately prioritizing financial gain over caring for Pumkin. Sophie's return to Jamaica with her influential grandfather, Mr. Audley Jones, initiates a legal confrontation with Paulette, who transfers guardianship for monetary compensation. Despite the transactional nature of the arrangement, Pumkin resolves to pursue a better life with Sophie in France, acknowledging the emotional void left by her mother’s rejection. Supported by Mr. Jones’s arrangements, Pumkin relocates without financial repayment stress. Amidst celebrations of her exam success with Miss Keene and Sophie, Pumkin’s joy is tinged with the sadness of familial rejection.\nReflecting on their new life in France, Pumkin soon grapples with her continued sense of not belonging, as she attempts to fit into foreign surroundings. The large presence of black French-speaking Africans does not mitigate her feeling of being a minority. Sophie's attempts to cement her status in society by refining their accents and appearances render Pumkin frustrated with the pressure to conform. Despite these challenges, Pumkin integrates into school life, developing friendships with Fabiette and Ondine, though many of her Jamaican customs and pastries cannot be replicated due to different ingredients, further distancing her from her heritage.\nFailing to feel a sense of belonging either in France or as per Sophie’s expectations, Pumkin understands that she’d been fighting for Sophie’s dream, not her own. Deciding to return to Jamaica, she reconciles her need to find fulfillment in her roots rather than a foreign land. In the epilogue, Pumkin reflects on her journey to discovering her worth independent of the pressures to conform and chooses the familiarity and community of Jamaica over the isolation she felt in France.\nIn Jamaica, Pumkin attends sixth form while living with Miss Keene, embracing her identity and beloved community scenes. The familiar scents, music, and kindness embody what she has yearned for, and despite Sophie’s opposition, she embraces her true self, no longer seeking to fit into someone else’s vision for her life. She reconnects with cherished friends, sharing laughter and traditions, embodying the joy in reclaiming her Jamaican roots while anticipating future possibilities on her own terms, with little regard for fitting a mold she doesn't identify with.",
