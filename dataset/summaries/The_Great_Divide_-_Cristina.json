Valentina, a key figure in Gatún, leads her community in protests against the canal's upheavals, embodying unity and resilience in the face of displacement. Omar, initially isolated following a violent confrontation, joins the protest, compelled by a sense of responsibility for the canal's impact on his community. Throughout these struggles, characters like the photographer Molly attempt to document and raise awareness of their plight, facing media neglect.\nIn Panama, Ada Bunting fears deportation due to an incident at the Oswald household but is heartened by news of her sister Millicent's recovery back home in Barbados. Her impending departure marks a significant reconciliation of personal ties. Meanwhile in Barbados, Lucille Bunting battles economic hardships but finds solace in Millicent's recovery, thanks to the altruism of Dr. Leonard Jenkins, who helps alleviate their medical debts. Alongside them, community solidarity is embodied by supportive figures like Willoughby, underpinning the themes of resilience and hope amid socio-economic adversities.\nSix years later, the canal's construction reaches its culmination, an event that transcends political tensions brewing in Europe. John Oswald, observing the first vessel's transit, grapples with professional ambitions in eradicating malaria. Clement, a central figure in canal operations, feels a rush of pride and uncertainty as the project nears its conclusion. Despite injuries and setbacks, he reflects on his part in this vast endeavor without achieving his expected fortune. Francisco, intertwined with personal loss and companionship in the ethereal presence of Esme, leads a quiet life with his son Omar, who aspires to become a teacher, sharing educational insights during their evening meals.\nThrough the intertwined narratives of displacement, ambition, and personal growth, the story illustrates resilience and solidarity amid transformative socio-political landscapes.",
