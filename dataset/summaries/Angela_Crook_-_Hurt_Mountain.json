Delilah’s abduction and connection to the malevolent Freedman Hurt thrusts Olivia, Brandon’s ex-wife and a compassionate pediatrician, into emotional turmoil. As a severe storm brews and tensions with the media escalate, led by reporter Sheldon Myers, Olivia's ability to offer safety is tested, compounding the crisis at home. Meanwhile, Brandon is driven to investigate Hurt Mountain Farm, uncovering the grim legacy behind Freedman Hurt’s operations.\nBrandon's pursuit, aided by allies like Hector and the Jessups, leads to the discovery of past victims, including Allison Moore, whose remains he uncovers.
