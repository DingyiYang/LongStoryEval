        "overall_sum": "Ying Yue, a princess marked by a prophecy, becomes pivotal in the battle against a mirrored alternate world that threatens her realm. As she navigates political intrigues and personal losses, Ying's development is anchored by her mystical abilities as \"the Fish\" and her complex relationship with Prince Shan Zhang Lin. They confront familial and imperial betrayals, notably the empress's plot to poison the emperor, further embroiling them in a war between worlds. Growing in strength through guidance from the mystical Mei Po, Ying explores her powers and potential. Mei Po's guidance points toward sealing the mirrored world's gateway, pushing Ying and the prince to expedite their union to tap into their combined strength. Even as personal dynamics intensify, external tensions mount with the mirror world army, led by the menacing Mirror Prince, a reflection of a personal affection turned enemy. \nAs the emperor falls to poison and absolute rule shatters, Ying and Prince Zhang focus on understanding their destined roles, discovering that their essence, energy, and spirit can unite to form the \"Three Treasures,\" a pivotal key to restoring balance. The prince battles with strategic leadership, his loyalties to family and legacy motivating him against mirror assaults. Meanwhile, Ying's internal growth embodies a fiery passion, recognizing the water-based abilities of her heritage bind her fate to the realm's continuity. The full moon triggers relentless hostilities, with Ying facing off against the Mirror Prince in a dire confrontation underscored by their past. The rising tension and magical creatures, particularly the fire crows, heighten the stakes as she guides her powers toward saving her world.\nIn a critical juncture, Mei Po sacrifices herself to protect the realm, catalyzing Ying’s understanding that she must seal the threatening portal herself. Her pledge aligns with Prince Zhang’s, intertwining destiny and budding love. Throughout the ordeal, Ying confronts her fears, the burden of leadership, and an oppressive mirror-image army. Ultimately, in a decisive act driven by her fate, Ying merges jīng, qì, and shén—essence, energy, and spirit—tying them to the prophecy and embracing her role as the Phoenix. Accepting her transformation, she stares into mortality’s eyes as she leaps into a heroic tempest to halt the mirror world’s siege and fulfill her destiny.\nAfter repelling the mirror army with her newfound elemental powers, Ying successfully seals the gateway by drawing heat from the lake, freezing it and the pathway to the mirror world. However, her victory is bittersweet, marred by the loss of her prince. In a miraculous twist, Ying’s love revives Prince Zhang, reaffirming their bond. Recognizing Ying’s leadership and accomplishments, Zhang publicly relinquishes the throne to her, solidifying her as Empress. Together, they embark on a shared reign, promising to lead their people with empathy and strength, melding their destinies in an era of peace and reconstruction.",
