        "overall_sum": "At Beechwood Castle, a group of individuals is drawn together under false pretenses, linked by personal secrets and an ominous history surrounding the site. The cast includes Staci, an influencer hoping to mend her relationship with her mother Bonnie, a reformed fraudulent psychic; Rad, a former cop burdened by unsolved cases linked to the castle; Cornelius, an architect in financial distress; Penelope, an ambitious crime writer; Lolly, a trauma survivor tied to Beechwood’s dark past; and Mary Beth, the castle's manager trying to maintain order. Trapped by a storm, the guests' mistrust grows amidst murders reminiscent of past unsolved crimes. Old secrets, haunting drawings, and Rad’s exposure as a fraud complicate the tension, fracturing trust and alliances.\nAs events spiral, Robert Jewel, Penelope’s husband, reveals himself as the orchestrator of both past and present killings, aiming to provide a macabre gift to his wife. Attempts to stop him go awry, leading to deadly encounters and the ultimate confrontation with Penelope emerging as a reluctant hero. Many guests, including Bonnie, fall victim to Robert’s madness before Penelope aids in his demise, saving Lolly and helping end the ordeal. Law enforcement arrives, leaving survivors like Staci reeling from trauma but empowered to start anew.\nIn the aftermath, Staci leaves her old life behind, investing a settlement from the Jewel estate into her dreams and her family's future. Her narrative progresses from survival to growth, as she channels her experiences into solving missing persons cases, reinforcing themes of resilience and purpose. Conversely, Penelope capitalizes on her husband’s notoriety to amplify her profile, securing a lucrative book deal titled \"Living with a Monster.\" She grapples with convoluted emotions toward Robert, admitting to exploiting their story for financial and social gain, manifesting her ambition and complicated sense of triumph.\nAs Staci ventures on a summer road trip with her daughter and deteriorating father, determined to build new memories and sever past cycles of abuse, Penelope navigates the social circles that now admire her for her notorious ties. Staci's focus shifts toward creating a loving and supportive environment for Sadie, while Penelope, seemingly thriving amidst her complicated feelings about Robert, appears intent on crafting a narrative to maximize intrigue and profit, reflecting her canny, calculated side. Both women face futures redefined by their choices at and beyond Beechwood Castle, standing as testaments to personal growth, ambition, and the shadows of human malevolence.",
