        "overall_sum": "Amara is a young woman in colonial-era Sri Lanka, caught in societal expectations and embroiled in supernatural forces. Her father, Thaththa, is suspected of witchcraft following a jungle attack, while her mother, Kumari, presses Amara towards marriage to protect their reputation. Delving into mystical realities, Amara discovers Bhagya is a deity named Kaali, seeking justice against immoral men, further complicating Amara’s perspective on family values and her powers.\nRaam, her former romantic interest, betrays Amara by announcing his engagement to Neha, blaming Amara for infidelity. This emotional conflict awakens Amara’s latent abilities, pushing her on a mystical journey. She retreats into the jungle and finds refuge with Heen Achchi. Bhagya unveils Amara's pregnancy and offers esoteric wisdom about her mystical vendetta. Despite societal pressures, Amara hesitates to adopt Bhagya’s brand of justice, seeing it as morally gray.\nReturning home, Amara's world collapses as her house is burned by Aloysius's men, branding her family as demon-worshippers. Wading through chaos, she chooses to confront the situation, while supernatural influences tighten their hold over her. In a dream state, Amara faces a demonic entity, awakening in unfamiliar surroundings. Captured by her uncle Jeevan Maama, he falsely claims Amara’s pregnancy was a result of possession. Consumed by fury and grief, Amara summons Bhagya’s power, killing her uncle.\nConfronting her mother Kumari, Amara exposes familial betrayals, and in a rage, ends Kumari’s life as well. Amara confronts her father, learning of his complicity in valuing societal myths over her well-being. Disillusioned by his cowardice, Amara delivers one final act of vengeance. In the aftermath, she seeks solace in the sea, marking her figurative rebirth from vengeance's ashes.\nNow seeking a fresh start, Amara boards a boat to Colombo but faces inner turmoil as she grapples with Bhagya, who wants to continue their path of retribution. Amara resists, realizing she’s transforming into a yakshaniya—a revelation that pushes her to escape into the sea, refusing to live as a monster.\nMeanwhile, Raam, now socially shamed due to a broken engagement, encounters an enigmatic woman on his way home. She lures him into a jungle, revealing herself as Amara’s demonic alter-ego, exacting brutal vengeance for his past misdeeds. This encounter solidifies the demoness’s role as both a vessel of retribution and a cautionary figure for a community complicit in male harm against women.",
