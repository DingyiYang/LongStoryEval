        "overall_sum": "Lady Roscille navigates the tumultuous court of Alba alongside her husband, Macbeth, whose ambitions are fueled by prophecy. Caught between complicity and rebellion, Roscille strives for autonomy amidst political machinations after her privileged upbringing in Naoned. With Macbeth’s ascension to Thane of Glammis, they are pulled into a complex web of deceit. Roscille is torn between vulnerability and subtle defiance, enduring Macbeth's manipulations and grappling with the shadow of King Duncane's murder.\nConfronted by threats from Æthelstan’s army, Roscille increasingly feels isolated and endangered, particularly during council meetings where she is blindfolded, symbolizing her constrained position in Macbeth's increasingly tyrannical court. Her moral compass is tested through interactions with key figures like Banquho and Fléance, challenging her allegiance to her husband.\nRoscille also encounters a secretive network of witches, including former Queen Gruoch, who provide cryptic prophecies and guidance, hinting at the futility of Macbeth’s prophecy-driven pursuits. Her bond with Senga symbolizes resilience and solidarity against the oppressive rule. Escalating tensions drive thoughts of escape, highlighting Roscille's struggle for agency.\nDriven to madness by ambition, Macbeth accuses Roscille of infidelity, leading to her descent into darkness with the witches. Here, Roscille recalls cherished memories and experiences a transformative realization, symbolized by accepting the weight of the witches’ power. This empowerment allows her to confront existential threats.\nEmerging back into the world, Roscille witnesses Æthelstan's ragged army struggling against nature and perceives her own dilemma: the need for Glammis to fall for her freedom. She narrowly escapes Fléance's assault, bolstered by her newfound strength and the intervention of Lisander, revealed to be a dragon, who represents her deepening bond with him amidst the broader prophecy.\nWith her allies, Roscille resolves to end Macbeth’s tyrannical reign. Despite doubts sown by Macbeth about her powers, she faces him with confidence, using the combined strength of their shared visions to defeat him, signifying the triumph of prophecy’s subversion and women's indomitable spirit.",
