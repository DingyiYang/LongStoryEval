        "overall_sum": "The story begins in a winter setting just before Christmas. Ysolde Scot, a young woman, drives a carriage with her sister, Merowdis, beside her. Merowdis is discussing her pet pig, Apple, while they navigate through a snowy lane towards the woods. Their conversation reflects their father's misunderstanding of why the pig was named 'Apple,' insinuating it was chosen due to apple sauce. This humorous dialogue establishes Merowdis's fondness for animals, including her many pets, which their parents do not appreciate.\nAs they arrive at the wood-gate, Merowdis disembarks with her dogs, Pretty and Amandier, and Apple the pig, expressing a sense of relief at being alone with them. In this solitude, she reflects on her desire to avoid marrying George Blanchland, as she does not feel connected with him. Her conversation with the woods and the animals reveals her inner conflict and yearning for deeper purpose and connection, including her desire to have a child of her own.\nIn a mystical interaction, Merowdis communes with the woods, which seem to respond to her longing for a child. She envisions herself with a bear cub, interpreting it as a midwinter child she wishes for. Her companions express concern, but she is resolute in her longing for this mystical connection. Eventually, Ysolde collects Merowdis to return home, where Merowdis shares her happiness about the promise of a child from the woods. Ysolde, despite not fully understanding, supports her sister.\nThe story ends with the ominous foreshadowing of Merowdis disappearing into the woods forever, fulfilled by her visions. In the city, a painting of Merowdis depicts her as a triumphant and fierce woman, embodying her connection to the wild through the bear cub in her lap.",
