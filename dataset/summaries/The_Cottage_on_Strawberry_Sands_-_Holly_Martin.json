As Roo quickly rose within the company, rumors spread linking her professional success to favoritism. Despite the gossip, she remained committed to her work and her passion for wildlife conservation through the Secret Squirrel Society and Little Paws Wildlife Rescue. Roo and Theo faced challenges from landowner Adam Larch, who planned to sell his land, threatening the conservation efforts.\nTo protect Little Paws, Roo and Theo spearheaded community fundraising campaigns, enduring Adam’s annoyance at the conservation efforts that countered his financial goals, amid rumors of his illegal activities. A pivotal moment occurred when Theo's empathy persuaded Adam to sell the land for Little Paws’ conservation. Theo successfully negotiated to purchase the land, securing its future, marking a significant professional milestone and ensuring continued conservation efforts beyond Violet’s management tenure.\nTheo, feeling distanced from his CEO role, decided to pass the leadership of Pet Protagonist to his partner Charlie, allowing him to focus on Little Paws. At the company’s summer ball, Theo and Roo formally announced their relationship, dispelling rumors and establishing transparency. Roo met Beth, Charlie's wife, who was preparing to step in as managing director, symbolizing a leadership transition at Pet Protagonist as Theo shifted his priorities.\nTheir public acknowledgment at the ball reflected their strong commitment to each other, both professionally and personally, as Theo proposed Roo move into his Apple Hill Bay residence. She joyfully accepted, reinforcing their shared vision for the future. Over time, gossip about Roo and Theo faded, replaced by curiosity about Theo’s departure reason from Pet Protagonist, leading to various speculations.\nIn the epilogue, a year later, Roo is established in Little Haven and finds contentment waking up in Theo’s arms each day. She thrives at Pet Protagonist, enjoying collaborations with Nate and Beth, and regularly shares dinners with them and their partners. By this point, Theo is thriving as CEO of Little Paws, managing wildlife conservation effectively, which reflects his passion-driven career transformation. Roo and Theo enjoy collaborating on weekends and delight in both their personal and professional adventures together.\nTheo surprises Roo with an engagement through a book concept for Pet Protagonist, featuring a puppy that helps arrange a proposal. The surprise culminates with the arrival of a real English Setter puppy named Clarke, with Theo proposing—parallel to the book narrative.
