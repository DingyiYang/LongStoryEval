        "overall_sum": "Amid a spring break at a remote lodge in Oregon, Eva and her friends grapple with the mysterious death of Piper Meyers, a social media influencer found dead under unclear circumstances. Initial investigations are spearheaded by Detective Brennan, who interviews witness Noah Lauder and Paul Lauder, the lodge owner. Group tensions rise amid a severe storm, further complicated by memories of a recent altercation involving Piper’s boyfriend, Javier, and Danny. Central to the mystery is a video from Piper’s phone indicating blackmail, which Eva has seen, but it vanishes after Piper’s death.\nThe isolated lodge heightens paranoia and suspicion, with fears that Piper’s murder was committed by one of their own. As Eva and Colton, whose developing romantic bond offers mutual support, investigate Piper's death, personal truths are unearthed. Attention shifts to Miles, linked to stolen school test papers. With evidence suggesting school thefts and past events intertwining, Eva and Colton are engulfed in a web of deceit with Danny, Karly, and Noah emerging as central figures in the unfolding drama.\nIn the current segment, Eva traps Karly and Noah at a cave with a fabricated story, hoping to catch them confessing about Piper, but the plan backfires. Noah deletes her recording, and they turn on Eva, physically restraining her until Alice interrupts. Misled by Karly and Noah’s deception, she is sent to call the police, leaving Eva alone and vulnerable. Meanwhile, Danny confesses to Colton about his involvement in selling stolen test papers with Karly and Noah, feeling that one of them must have killed Piper to keep their secret hidden. Ultimately, the police apprehend Karly and Noah, who admit to their crimes.\nUpon returning home, Eva and her friends reunite with Miles, who understands Danny's part in the theft scandal but harbors no immediate hostility. As Eva faces Piper's upcoming memorial, she seeks to make sense of the harrowing events. Through the ordeal, her relationship with Colton strengthens, anchoring her amid chaos, anticipation, and uncertain futures as they embrace a hopeful new beginning.",
