Despite the duo's intense pursuit, the Yellow Rose retreats with the Americana, a vital part of their escape plan.

While they fail to capture the Confederates, their intelligence work proves vital. The narrative centers on diplomatic tact, as Robert Todd Lincoln and the British government aim to diplomatically defuse tensions. With the segment's conclusion, Barker and Llewelyn engage with their peers, such as Hesketh Pierce and John Flynn, reflecting on their mission's successes and failings and hinting at a return to everyday investigative work.\nIn this final segment, Llewelyn and Barker embark on a historical discussion of Confederate plots, covering the Knights of the Golden Circle's designs, historical U.S. diplomatic tensions, and European politics. As this assault unfolds, civilian character struggles add depth. While Thomas discovers Etienne's talented culinary regrets, he also realizes Rebecca's stability enriches character conflicts amid new family transitions.\nThe story concludes with the Prime Minister's telegram: the Yellow Rose has sunk in a Bermuda storm, the stolen gold and men vanished.
