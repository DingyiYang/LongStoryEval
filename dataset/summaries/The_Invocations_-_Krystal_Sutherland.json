Emer, a cursewriter, and survivor of a familial massacre by witch hunters, seeks justice with her guardian demon, Bael, aiding women ensnared by oppressive magical forces. Jude Wolf, entangled in a violent family lineage tied to witch hunts, revolts against the suffocating control of her father and brothers. Concurrently, Zara Jones delves into necromancy to uncover her sister Savannah's murder and secure vengeance.\nTheir paths converge in Oxford, where their alliance solidifies amid mysterious magical murders. Jude’s cursed powers unveil demonic connections among their foes, leading them to reflect at Emer’s Irish hideaway. Upon returning to London, Emer infiltrates a witch hunter's club, confronting her traumatic past while Zara and Jude confront their family's violent history.\nDuring a fateful confrontation at the Wolf mansion wedding, Jude uncovers Elijah's betrayal, highlighting the family's murderous legacy. Savannah, now a vengeful wraith, complicates the scenario, while Jude's alliance with Emer becomes vital. Emer, guided by Bael, uses intricate curses and cunning to ultimately confront Elijah, who admits executing witches to augment his power. In a climactic battle, Jude feigns death, allowing Emer to execute a powerful spell that challenges Elijah’s magical dominance, ultimately leading to his sacrifice and Jude's revival.\nAs the dust settles, Emer, fortified by Bael and Zara, contemplates her next steps in a quest to reclaim power lost to the patriarchy—a journey underpinning the lengths powerless individuals must go to subvert oppressive forces. The trio's deep bond is cemented as they confront the patriarchal tyranny manifesting through the Wolf family.\nIn the aftermath, Jude struggles with immense grief and existential questions. Lawrence, their father, survives, hinting at a future reconciliation despite past betrayals. Emer sets her sights on rebuilding Lough Leane, repurposing the space into a sanctuary from past violence. Zara navigates her grief with support from Gardner, identifying a future removed from occult entanglements. Emer's work is fueled by newfound resources from Bael, transforming the haunted residence into a beacon for witch revival.\nWith summer’s return, Jude and Zara reunite with Emer at Lough Leane, their bond strengthened by shared toils. Though academic paths loom, Jude chooses a daring deviation, remaining with Emer to nurture their partnership and newly-hatched love. The story concludes on a hopeful note, promising potential paths for redemption, love, and empowerment set against a backdrop of magical resistance and personal healing.",
