        "overall_sum": "Sylvie Devereaux enters into a fake marriage with Killian Barclay to align family interests and rescue Killian's estate from financial ruin. While initially motivated by financial reasons, the relationship evolves into a genuine emotional connection with Killian, who is a reclusive landowner pressured by familial expectations. Together, they navigate familial conflicts and public scrutiny, developing a bond that deepens through shared vulnerabilities and protective instincts, particularly during tense family interactions.\nThe thematic journey traverses through emotional intimacy and challenges, such as confronting family dynamics and addressing the emotions tied to their contractual marriage. Sylvie's confrontation with Anna about the marriage contract is pivotal, as it emphasizes Killian’s mental health and introduces critical tension. After the contract expires, Sylvie leaves, leaving behind her novel as a testament to her love for Killian.\nBack in New York, Sylvie strives to reclaim her identity, publishing her book and grappling with the emotional void left by Killian’s absence. This absence is intermittently bridged by their communications, offering hope for reconciliation. Killian, meanwhile, is on a path to overcoming his reclusiveness, seeking emotional support from Sylvie, which highlights the persistent connection between them amidst uncertainties about their future.\nFurther narrative layers unfold as Sylvie assists Enid in her art gallery, contrasting with her family's art business and fostering a growth-oriented friendship. The arrival of Sylvie's estranged mother prompts a raw confrontation, resulting in an apology that offers a semblance of closure from past familial neglect.\nAn emotional climax arises when Anna alerts Sylvie to Killian being missing, prompting her return to Scotland. However, Killian surprises Sylvie by choosing to join her in New York, symbolizing his intention to move forward with her, away from his estate.\nTheir commitment solidifies with a quiet remarriage, underscoring a dedication free from former contractual motives, and Killian’s decision to leave his ancestral home embodies his devotion to a shared future with Sylvie. Ultimately, the story embodies themes of personal transformation, enduring love, and navigating relationships toward authentic emotional bonds. \nIn the epilogue, a year later, the news of Aunt Lorna’s death and the unexpected inheritance of the family house challenges their resolve momentarily. However, they prioritize their life together in New York, with Killian deciding to let his brothers manage the estate, illustrating his commitment to Sylvie and their new life, embodying personal growth and freedom from the past’s burdens.",
