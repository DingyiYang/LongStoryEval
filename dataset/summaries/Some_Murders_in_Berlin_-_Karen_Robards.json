The case is complicated by Nazi politics, involving hidden conspiracies and involving the Paradise Club and Lebensborn project, focused on missing girls like Lotte Dietrich. Despite pressure from General Haupt to close the case on false pretenses, Elin and Kurt resolve to uncover the truth.\nTheir bond strengthens against a backdrop of war and resistance efforts, notably Kurt’s covert operations saving Jews, reflecting his disdain for the Nazi regime. However, their journey is fraught with peril. Attempts to escape Berlin alongside Pia and Jens culminate in tragedy when Pia is killed. Jens sacrifices himself to ensure others’ escape from a hijacked train destined for Denmark.\nReaching Denmark, Elin and Kurt navigate increasingly dangerous situations as they are hunted by Nazi authorities. Plans are in constant flux, especially with news of an impending Gestapo raid aimed at exterminating Danish Jews. Aided by the Danish Resistance, Elin prioritizes saving her son Niles, her heart torn by the oppressive circumstances.\nBefore the raid, Elin is detained by Gestapo agents on Haupt’s order but saved by Kurt’s intervention. They hastily flee Copenhagen to a fishing village, embarking on a risky boat journey to Sweden. As they depart, Elin and Kurt pledge to reunite after the war.\nThe narrative then shifts forward three years post-war; Elin has returned to her house in Østerbro, representative of life’s resilience and hope. Her relief at the survival of ninety percent of Denmark's Jews is palpable as she reintegrates with family and community. In a culmination of enduring love and promises kept, Kurt arrives at her doorstep, fulfilling his wartime vow.",
