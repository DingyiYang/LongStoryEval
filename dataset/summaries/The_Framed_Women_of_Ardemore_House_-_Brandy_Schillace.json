        "overall_sum": "Jo Jones, an American woman navigating post-divorce life, inherits the historical Ardemore estate in England, drawing her into a labyrinth of old secrets and current crimes. The narrative begins with the murder of Sid Randles, the estate caretaker, setting into motion investigations that reveal his involvement in illicit activities, including a sex work ring and financial exploits. DCI MacAdams takes charge of unraveling Sid's death, probing the intricate webs of deception that tie it to long-standing conspiracies.\nMacAdams investigates links between Sid’s ex-wife, Elsie Smythe, and their shared past, including money laundering and broader familial ramifications involving her brother, Jack Turner. Meanwhile, Jo delves into her inheritance's historical aspects, guided by antiques dealer Gwilym Morgan, discovering ties to famed garden designer Gertrude Jekyll and the enigmatic story of ancestor Evelyn Davies.\nThe story intensifies as suspense builds around Detective Jarvis Fleet, whose hidden history is riddled with corruption. Tensions climax when it emerges that Fleet, driven by desperate ambitions and a need to protect the \"Clapham file\"—highly incriminating military documents—was behind Sid's murder. His lethal actions lead Jo and MacAdams into a highly perilous confrontation during a storm, which ends with Fleet's demise in a house blaze.\nThe investigation peels back layers of deception linked to governmental corruption, as revealed in the Clapham file, implicating Fleet, Turner, and other military entanglements. Elsie's role is exposed, having blackmailed Sid using this knowledge to further her criminal objectives. An inferno that eradicates Jo’s inherited home becomes the crucible where past sins intermingle with present-day crime, forcing Jo and MacAdams to reconnoiter their personal trajectories amidst reality’s emerging truths.\nIn the aftermath, Jo discovers Evelyn's skeletal remains hidden beneath the burned house, sparking a renewed familial connection and commitment to creating a legacy for Evelyn. She turns control of the estate remnants and gardens over to the National Trust and begins repairs on her own cottage, renamed Netherleigh, determined to preserve Evelyn’s history and reframe her narrative.\nAs part of revitalizing Evelyn's existence, Jo restores her painting, uncovering it as a potential masterpiece by Augustus John. This resurgence reveals deeper family secrets—like letters exposing Evelyn's affair with her sister's husband, complicating Jo’s emotional engagement with her past. Though Evelyn's exact fate remains uncertain, Jo anchors herself to Evelyn’s story, inspired by finding a tangible tie to her lineage.\nMacAdams, meanwhile, faces professional dilemmas in his duty toward uncovering past corruptions and his own role within the investigative narrative. As he ties off loose ends from the case, including dealing with internal betrayals and public commendations, he finds an unexpected ally in Jo. Together, they navigate the aftershocks of the revelations surrounding Ardemore and its sullied secrets.\nJo chooses to remain in England, embracing her familial roots and the responsibility of ensuring Evelyn’s story isn't forgotten. Armed with newfound understanding, resolve, and a touch of optimism, she looks forward to what the future holds.",
