        "overall_sum": "Libby and her family find themselves lured into the enigmatic and foreboding world of a mansion known as the House of Masks—a place entangled with mysterious disappearances, including Libby's grandparents. Initially unrecognized by her skeptical mother, Sharon, Libby perceives supernatural forces at work, triggered by masks that possess wearers, transforming them into monstrous iterations of themselves. As strange happenings intensify, Libby and her neighbor Flynn—a medium with ties to the mansion—form a strong connection. Together, they conduct a séance that awakens malevolent powers, affecting Libby's sister Vivi, who becomes ensnared in the Butterfly mask, while their mother is influenced by the spirit, Rose.\nThe narrative builds as Libby takes a determined stance to save her family, harnessing the power within the Beetle mask to confront the horrors around them. Realizing a need for Flynn's medium abilities, they plan an escape, braving the hedge maze that shrouds the mansion. It is during this perilous venture that they discover a crypt—a hideaway holding masks that signify the impris0onment of their family members and Flynn's father, John. Here, John's ghost provides crucial insights into Ellen Clery's history with the house: a tale of summoning spirits named the Fallen Stars through a crystal ball and the intention to control them with masks. He reveals that only by conducting a risky séance can Libby and Flynn thwart the march towards the catastrophic Rite of the Stars, which involves thirteen souls unless halted.\nIn a climactic séance, Libby and Flynn face Ellen’s ghost; with unveiled resolve, they arrest her spiritual strife and rest her spirit, escape the crypt's clutches, and confront the spirits seeking their dark ritual at the séance table. Libby regains control long enough to attempt the destruction of the crystal ball, a contest mirrored against the spirits’ push to complete the Rite. With Vivi's aid, they shatter the ball, liberating themselves and putting spirits to rest.\nFollowing the supernatural climax, Flynn is left gravely wounded, and as Libby clutches him amid falling spectral remnants, sirens signify their salvation. The epilogue reveals the family, determined to rebuild their lives within the house, choosing to defy fear and spurning relocation. Libby faces the new school year with nervous resolve, buoyed by Flynn's companionship. Despite enduring visible setbacks from their summer ordeal, they resolve to live with renewed purpose.",
