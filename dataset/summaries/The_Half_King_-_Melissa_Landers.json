At the court, she becomes an ally to Daerick, a historian assisting in unraveling the curses' mysteries. As Cerise discovers her unique magical abilities, she feels unsettled in her traditional role while her bond with Kian deepens, blending romance and combined magical potential.\nChallenges arise at the palace when a ceremonial ritual fails, prompting Cerise to investigate a secret archive chamber. This leads to confrontation with Father Padron, revealed to be her father, with Nina as her mother. Padron's ambitions threaten everyone’s safety, climaxing in Nina's sacrifice to protect Cerise from him.\nIn the aftermath of Nina’s death, Cerise confronts Father Padron amidst chaos.

However, Father Padron escapes, adding to the tension.\nCerise mourns Nina while grappling with her new responsibilities as Shiera’s High Priestess, facing pressure to rebuild the Order. Kian reassures her of the critical need to endure, as they prepare for future threats.\nAs the new high priestess, Cerise asserts her autonomy by disposing of her temple attire. She prioritizes aiding Blue, a magical dog, and gathers allies for the renewed conflict. Upon meeting allies like Nero and discussing strategies against Padron, Cerise recognizes the precarious position of individuals with magical abilities and the pressing threat Father Padron poses with his freedom.\nThroughout, Cerise manages relationships with Kian, General Petros, and Daerick, addressing challenges wrought by Padron’s escape. They acknowledge the magnitude of Cerise’s past actions and strategize rekindling alliances.\nIn private, Cerise and Kian cherish tender moments, discussing the release of tortured souls as a consequence of her interventions. Kian proposes marriage, suggesting a partnership defying the era’s oppressive traditions. Cerise accepts, fueled by shared respect and love that promise new beginnings for themselves and the realm.\nIn an ominous epilogue, a “slain beauty” resurrects in a mystical event coinciding with Cerise's prayer, foreboding future challenges and confirming that the goddess remains entwined in their destiny.",
