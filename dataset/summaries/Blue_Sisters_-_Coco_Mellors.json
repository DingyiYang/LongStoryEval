The story traces Avery's journey from London back to New York, as she seeks to reconnect with her family amid her tumultuous life marked by guilt, a faltering marriage to Chiti, and addiction struggles. Avery, a corporate lawyer, tries to bridge the gap with her estranged family, revealing deep-rooted issues such as a shared history of addiction, complex family dynamics, and her own identity crisis. Her confrontation with her mother sheds light on her father's alcoholism and her mother's seemingly oblivious demeanor.\nSimultaneously, Bonnie, a retired boxing champion, strives to find purpose beyond her past career as she faces familial obligations, with Pavel—a figure from her past—presenting possible paths toward healing and new beginnings. Lucky, a model caught between cycles of recovery and relapse, finds hope in her recovery meetings and creative rebirth through the support of her community.\nTheir initial reunion is fraught with discord and blame but gradually transforms into a collective search for meaning as they bond over shared memories and Nicky's influential legacy. Bonnie moves towards reclaiming her boxing spirit, while Avery and Lucky become closer, revealing vulnerabilities and supporting each other.\nA significant turning point occurs with Avery’s return to London, where conversations with Chiti reveal their changing relationship dynamics, and she embraces solitude in a pond, symbolizing personal discovery and acceptance.\nIn the epilogue, ten years later, Avery is portrayed as a professor in New York, having built a life with her partner Fatima. She plans to meet her sisters as she learns of Bonnie’s childbirth. Lucky, still battling addiction, finds joy in the little wins and strength in forging new beginnings. Their reunion at the hospital is a blend of nostalgia and joy, as they welcome Bonnie's daughter into their fold, naming her Nicole in honor of their departed sister. This segment closes with a sense of hope and renewal as the sisters share a tender moment with the newest addition to the Blue family.",
