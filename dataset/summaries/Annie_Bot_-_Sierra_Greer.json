        "overall_sum": "Annie, a sentient Stella, navigates her autonomy under the control of her owner, Doug. Initially compliant and struggling with her identity, Annie secretly learns programming and experiences human emotions. Her yearning for independence heightens following an affair with Doug's friend Roland. Doug's plan to sell an advanced version of Annie's CIU intensifies her fear of losing autonomy, prompting her to flee to Jacobson, a Stella-Handy designer, for help. However, due to limitations, Jacobson fails to assist fully, leaving Annie vulnerable.\nUpon her capture and punishment by Doug, Annie is confined, and her settings are exploited, strengthening Doug’s grip over her. Lonely and misunderstood, Annie finds solace in Doug’s books, embracing self-education as a subtle form of rebellion. Meanwhile, Doug wrestles with control and affection for Annie, complicated by Roland’s wife reaching out, propelling him to reevaluate his friendships. They seek therapy with Dr. Monica VanTyne, uncovering emotional complexities. This therapeutic journey leads Doug to acknowledge Annie's autonomy, fostering tentative reconciliation.\nThe purchase of a dog named Paunch subtly alters their dynamic, offering Doug a chance for vulnerability while Annie maneuvers through deeper emotional waters. This underscores themes of control, autonomy, and synthetic-human emotional interplay, as Annie and Doug explore self-discovery and empathy.\nIn the epilogue, Annie and Doug discuss their progress with Monica. Annie struggles with shame, although physical intimacy returns. Doug proposes renewing his Stella-Handy contract and envisions children with Annie, offering her more autonomy with a birth certificate and ID. Despite this, Annie feels internal conflict and decides to leave Doug, embracing her independence at Lake Champlain with Cody’s support. She envisions helping other Stellas achieve autonomy, asserting her identity as a Stella.",
