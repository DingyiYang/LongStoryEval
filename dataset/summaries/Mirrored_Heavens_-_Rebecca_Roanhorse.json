        "overall_sum": "In a universe dictated by celestial prophecies and political schemes, Tova edges towards war. Serapio – the Crow God Reborn – is entrusted with protecting Tova from a conglomeration of Treaty cities' forces. Tensions within Tova escalate when Okoa kills Isel Winged Serpent, further complicated by an ominous prophecy suggesting the sacrifice of a loved one, possibly Xiala. Serapio and Xiala’s bond deepens amidst these chaotic events, providing hope and comfort. Xiala, armed with potent Song magic, learns of Balam's ambition and uses a shadowgate to warn Serapio before traveling to Tova. Former Sun Priest Naranpa, with allies Iktan and Kupshu, prepares to counter Balam's schemes using forbidden magic. Their journey leads them through the Graveyard of the Gods, where Naranpa sacrifices much to protect Tova.\nOkoa crashes near an enemy camp and prepares for likely capture but preempts by discovering plans involving shadowgate infiltration. His sister Esa’s betrayal leads to his tragic demise, amplifying the web of deceit and divided loyalties affecting Tova. In Hokaia, Balam struggles with visions urging him to betray his cousin Powageh. He uses blood magic to travel to Tova’s celestial tower, triggering Serapio’s intervention. Balam, believed to be Serapio’s father, complicates the prophecy further. Xiala integrates within the defenses strategized by master engineer Enuka, poised against the advancing adversaries. Xiala and Serapio face off against Balam in a climactic battle. Serapio struggles with his internal battle against the crow god while Xiala uses her Song magic, defeating Balam successfully and highlighting her strategic and magical growth. Naranpa, in a dream-like conflict with the sun god, grapples with whether to unleash divine wrath on Tova. She ultimately resists the god’s pull, but at great personal cost.\nTwo months after the fall of the Carrion King, rumors define the aura in Tova, speaking of Naranpa’s comatose return with the Priest of Knives. Xiala's significant role in preventing a naval invasion lifts her as a savior figure, though she avoids leadership, preferring to retreat to Teek lands to nurture and protect her son, Akona, who bears a resemblance to Serapio. Six years later, Iktan, as Tova’s ambassador, witnesses the growth of Teek’s influence and updates Xiala on a lead concerning Serapio's location in the far Western mountains. Xiala deliberates between her royal duties and the opportunity to reunite with Serapio.\nIn a crossroads of past and future, Xiala finds Serapio in an Obregi monastery, living in solitude post-transformation—a consequence of rejecting the crow god's manipulation. Their reunion uncovers the shared secret of their son, Akona, whose heritage connects with Serapio’s now dormant divine nature. The reunion is laden with relief, acknowledgement of personal sacrifices, and the rekindling of a deep-seated bond offering new hope amid the volatility of prophecy and destiny.",
