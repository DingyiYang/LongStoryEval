Initially reluctant to enter new relationships, Mel gradually embraces a polyamorous connection with Bebe, a dynamic lawyer, and Kade, a creative artist. As Mel navigates her evolving romantic life, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with changes at Terror & Virtue, prompting her to seek new opportunities. Support from Daniel, her best friend, as well as her new partners, helps Mel re-evaluate her perspectives on love and open relationships.\nA pivotal ski trip with Bebe and Kade cements their triadic bond after an unexpected storm brings Mel and Kade closer. Their open discussion about future possibilities results in a consensual relationship that enriches all three lives. Back in New York, they propose polyamorous guidelines and open communication, deepening their connections and ensuring a healthy dynamic.\nProfessionally, Mel faces the challenge of a cocktail competition at Food Fest, where she must create a drink that embodies New York.

Mel encounters her ex-wife, underscoring her personal growth and fulfillment within her current relationship.\nA year later, Mel takes a significant step by becoming part owner of Collective Spirits, a bar she helped transform from Sal's dilapidated dive into a welcoming lounge. She shares ownership with silent and vocal partners, including Daniel, Ronica, and Adam Lavender, who offer support and guidance. As Daniel moves in with his partner, Mel looks forward to living independently in their previous apartment, embedded in her beloved New York City.\nOn the hottest day of summer, Mel faces the challenge of a broken AC just days before the bar's soft opening. Despite the stress, Bebe and Kade's visit offers much-needed companionship.
