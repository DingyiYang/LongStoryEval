### Review:
**World-Building and Setting:**
The historical setting was well-researched, but the fantasy elements felt underdeveloped and inconsistent. The witches' powers and Lisander's dragon form were introduced without sufficient explanation or integration into the world-building.

### Overall Assessment:
The historical setting was well-researched, but the fantasy elements felt underdeveloped and inconsistent. The witches' powers and Lisander's dragon form were introduced without sufficient explanation or integration into the world-building.
