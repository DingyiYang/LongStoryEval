### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the mother's death was predictable, and the ending, while intense, felt somewhat rushed.

**Characters:**
Annie Shaw's character development was inconsistent, with her OCD symptoms appearing and disappearing at random. The portrayal of her mother's death felt underdeveloped, and the father's character lacked depth, making it difficult to understand his motivations.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of vivid imagery effectively conveyed Annie's OCD symptoms. However, the inconsistent pacing and lack of character development detracted from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the Shaw family's estate in Boston was vividly described, but the lack of depth in the father's character and the mother's death made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world.

**Themes:**
The novel effectively explores themes of OCD, trauma, and family dynamics. However, the inconsistent character development and predictable plot twist diminished the impact of these themes.

**Emotional Impact:**
The novel's emotional impact was hindered by the lack of depth in the father's character and the mother's death. The ending, while intense, felt rushed and did not fully resonate.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel's engaging writing style and vivid imagery kept me invested in the story, despite its flaws.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, which promised a thrilling and emotionally charged story. However, the inconsistent pacing and lack of character development left me feeling disappointed.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had moments of brilliance, particularly in its writing style and exploration of OCD and trauma, it fell short in terms of character development, pacing, and plot execution. The predictable plot twist and rushed ending further diminished the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the story had potential, and I would be open to reading more from this author in the future.

### Score: 3.2
