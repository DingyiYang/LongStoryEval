### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist regarding the nanny's death was predictable, and the revelation about Harriet's true intentions lacked surprise.

**Characters:**
Stella's character development was inconsistent, with her growth feeling rushed and underdeveloped. The romance between Stella and Natalia was introduced too late and lacked sufficient buildup, making it feel forced and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors, such as comparing the house to a "house of glass," was particularly effective.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the Barclay family's home was vividly described, but the house itself felt underutilized as a character. The author's use of metaphors, such as comparing the house to a "house of glass," was a standout feature.

**Themes:**
The story effectively explores themes of trauma, family dynamics, and the complexities of human relationships. However, the execution of these themes was inconsistent, with some elements feeling rushed or underdeveloped.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by its predictability and lack of surprise. The romance between Stella and Natalia felt forced and unconvincing, which further detracted from the emotional depth of the narrative.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The story had moments of intrigue and kept me engaged, but the overall experience was marred by its predictability and lack of emotional depth.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short of my expectations. The story's potential was not fully realized, leaving me feeling disappointed.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had moments of intrigue and a strong premise, its predictability, rushed pacing, and underdeveloped characters made it a disappointing read. The writing style and metaphors were highlights, but they couldn't compensate for the overall lack of emotional depth and surprise.

### Score: 2.5
