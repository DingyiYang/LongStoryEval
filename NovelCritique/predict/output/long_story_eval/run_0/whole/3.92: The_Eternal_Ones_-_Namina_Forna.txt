### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Deka's mother was both surprising and impactful, but it felt somewhat rushed, leaving me wanting more depth and resolution.

**Characters:**
Deka's journey from a vulnerable and uncertain individual to a powerful deity was compelling, and her growth was well-developed. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a personal level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery was particularly effective. However, the frequent use of "I" and "me" felt repetitive and detracted from the overall flow.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was impressive, with a richly detailed and immersive setting that drew me in. The concept of gods and goddesses was intriguing, and the idea of Deka's divine powers was well-executed.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of power, identity, and the consequences of one's actions was thought-provoking. However, the themes of love and sacrifice felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more depth.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was significant, particularly in the final chapters. However, the rushed resolution of certain plot points left me feeling unsatisfied.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I thoroughly enjoyed the story and found it engaging, despite its flaws. The author's writing style and the world-building kept me invested throughout.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was excited to dive into this book, having loved the first installment. While it didn't quite meet my expectations, it was still a worthwhile read.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed this book and found it to be a worthwhile read. While it had its flaws, particularly in pacing and character development, the world-building, writing style, and emotional impact made it a memorable experience. I'm excited to see where the author takes the story next.

### Score: 3.5
