### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Joe's marriage was predictable and lacked surprise, while the resolution of Sophie's identity felt rushed and underdeveloped.

**Characters:**
Sophie's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting between chapters. Joe's character was underdeveloped, and his motivations for keeping his marriage a secret were unclear. The supporting characters, such as Sophie's family, were well-written and added depth to the story.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the humor was well-executed, particularly in the dialogue. However, the excessive use of adverbs detracted from the overall quality of the writing.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Harford was vividly described, but the story's reliance on a single location made it feel overly repetitive.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of identity, family, and love, which are engaging and well-executed. However, the portrayal of Sophie's mother as a villain felt unrealistic and detracted from the story's overall message.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story elicited strong emotions, particularly in the scenes where Sophie's identity was revealed. However, the rushed resolution and lack of character development diminished the emotional impact.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel was an enjoyable read, with moments of humor and emotional depth. However, the uneven pacing and lack of character development made it difficult to fully engage with the story.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel's premise was intriguing, and the idea of a romance author hiding her identity was compelling. However, the execution fell short of expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had an intriguing premise and moments of humor and emotional depth, its uneven pacing, lack of character development, and unrealistic portrayal of Sophie's mother detracted from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, the story was still an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to fans of romance and chick-lit.

### Score: 3.5
