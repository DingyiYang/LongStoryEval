### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the curse was predictable, and the resolution felt overly simplistic.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them. Beau's backstory was underutilized, and his relationship with Arabella felt rushed and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly flowery, which detracted from the story's overall impact. The excessive use of metaphors and poetic language made it difficult to focus on the plot.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The castle setting was underutilized, and the world-building was lacking. The magical elements felt disconnected from the rest of the story.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of self-love and acceptance were overshadowed by the romance, which felt forced and unconvincing.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disengaged from the story, unable to connect with the characters or plot.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited to read this book, but it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed with this book. The uneven pacing, lack of character development, and forced romance made it a struggle to finish. The writing style and world-building were also subpar, and the story failed to deliver on its promising themes. I wouldn't recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
