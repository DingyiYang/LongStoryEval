### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's structure was confusing, as it jumped between characters and timelines without a clear narrative thread. This made it difficult to follow and connect with the characters.

**Characters:**
The characters were underdeveloped, and their stories lacked depth. The protagonist, Cherry, was particularly unlikable, making it challenging to empathize with her or her journey.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall impact. The excessive detail made the narrative feel slow and tedious.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the plane was underutilized, and the story could have benefited from more exploration of this unique environment.

**Themes:**
The novel's themes of fate and the interconnectedness of lives were intriguing but ultimately underdeveloped. The story lacked depth and failed to explore these ideas in a meaningful way.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested in the characters and their journeys.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the novel to be a tedious read, with a slow pace and lack of engagement. The story failed to hold my interest, and I often found myself skimming through the pages.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, but it failed to deliver on its promise. The story lacked the depth and engagement I had hoped for.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I found the novel to be a disappointing read. The confusing structure, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional impact made it a tedious and unengaging experience. While the premise was intriguing, the execution fell short, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested in the story.
