### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Ellie Grace's confession was predictable and lacked surprise, while the revelation about Malcolm's true parentage was underwhelming.

**Characters:**
The characters were well-developed, but their motivations and actions often felt inconsistent. For example, Ellie Grace's decision to shoot her father was unconvincing, and her subsequent confession lacked emotional depth.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of descriptive language effectively set the scene for the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The Washington, D.C. setting was vividly described, immersing me in the world of the Calhoun family.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of family dynamics, manipulation, and the consequences of secrets. However, the execution of these themes fell short, leaving me wanting more depth and complexity.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the emotional response I had hoped for. Despite its potential, the characters' actions and motivations lacked the depth needed to create a lasting impact.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story engaging at first, but as it progressed, I became increasingly frustrated with the inconsistencies and lack of emotional depth.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited to read this book, but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. The premise was intriguing, but the execution failed to deliver.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had a promising premise and a well-crafted setting, it ultimately fell short in execution. The inconsistent pacing, predictable plot twists, and lack of emotional depth left me disappointed. Despite its potential, the story failed to deliver the depth and complexity I was hoping for.

### Score: 2.5
