### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot was predictable, and the ending, while emotionally impactful, felt rushed and lacked sufficient buildup.

**Characters:**
The characters were well-developed, and their relationships were a highlight of the story. However, the romance felt rushed and lacked depth, which was disappointing given the book's focus on it.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was beautiful and evocative, with vivid descriptions that brought the world to life. However, the pacing issues and rushed ending detracted from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was rich and immersive, with a unique and well-developed cosmology. The setting of Wisteria Manor was particularly captivating, and I would have loved to see more of it.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of grief, love, and the power of memories was beautifully executed. However, the themes of fate and destiny felt underdeveloped and lacked depth.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was significant, particularly in its exploration of grief and love. However, the rushed ending left me feeling unsatisfied.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I was thoroughly engaged in the story, especially during the moments of romance and character development. However, the pacing issues and rushed ending made it difficult to fully enjoy the experience.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was excited to read this book, especially after enjoying the author's previous work. However, it didn't quite meet my expectations, particularly in terms of the romance and pacing.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed the story's emotional depth and the beauty of the writing, but the pacing issues, rushed ending, and underdeveloped themes left me feeling unsatisfied. Despite these flaws, the characters and their relationships were a highlight, and I would still recommend the book to fans of the author's previous work.
