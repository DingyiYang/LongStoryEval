### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the car's discovery was predictable, and the resolution of the mystery was anticlimactic.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them. The romance between Ryan and Alison felt forced and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the overall experience. The frequent use of "he said" and "she said" made the dialogue feel clunky and unnatural.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The story's international setting was intriguing, but the execution fell short. The author's attempt to incorporate various locations and cultures felt superficial and lacked authenticity.

**Themes:**
The novel's themes of love, redemption, and survival were promising but ultimately fell flat due to the lack of character development and a compelling plot.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested in the characters and their journeys.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disengaged from the story, struggling to stay interested in the characters and their experiences.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel's premise was intriguing, but the execution failed to meet my expectations. The story's potential was left unfulfilled, leaving me disappointed.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, this novel was a disappointing read. Despite its intriguing premise, the story fell flat due to poor pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of emotional depth. The writing style and dialogue were also subpar, making it difficult to stay engaged. While the international setting had potential, it was not executed well. I would not recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
