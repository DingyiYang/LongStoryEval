### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The mystery surrounding the murders was intriguing, but the resolution felt rushed and lacked the depth I had hoped for.

**Characters:**
Tru's character development was impressive, and her relationship with Rio was both sweet and well-executed. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery was particularly effective. However, the dialogue often felt forced and unnatural, which detracted from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Mount Orange, Florida, was vividly described, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery added depth to the world-building.

**Themes:**
The story effectively explored themes of grief, trauma, and the complexities of human relationships. However, the resolution of the mystery felt rushed and lacked the emotional depth I had hoped for.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's exploration of grief and trauma was emotionally resonant, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery added a powerful layer of depth.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
Overall, I enjoyed the story and found it engaging, but the uneven pacing and rushed resolution left me wanting more.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was drawn to this book by its intriguing premise and the author's previous work. While it didn't fully meet my expectations, it was still an enjoyable read.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed the story and appreciated the author's writing style, but the uneven pacing, rushed resolution, and lack of depth in supporting characters left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the book was still a worthwhile read, and I'm excited to see what the author does next.
