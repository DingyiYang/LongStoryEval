### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot was predictable, and the ending lacked the emotional impact I had hoped for.

**Characters:**
Lady Roscille's character development was inconsistent, with her transformation from a passive accomplice to a powerful figure feeling abrupt and unconvincing. The romance between Roscille and Lisander lacked depth and chemistry, making their relationship feel forced and unengaging.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall flow. The frequent use of "Lady" and "Lady Roscille" became repetitive and annoying.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The historical setting was well-researched, but the fantasy elements felt underdeveloped and inconsistent. The witches' powers and Lisander's dragon form were introduced without sufficient explanation or integration into the world-building.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of women's empowerment and the dangers of unchecked ambition was intriguing, but it lacked depth and nuance. The themes were introduced too late in the narrative, making them feel superficial.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the emotional response I was hoping for. The ending, in particular, was disappointing and left me feeling unsatisfied.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, which made it difficult to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was excited to read a Lady Macbeth retelling, but the execution fell short of my expectations. The book's marketing and blurb created unrealistic hopes, leading to disappointment.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had some redeeming qualities, such as its historical setting and exploration of women's empowerment, it ultimately fell short of my expectations. The uneven pacing, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional impact made it a disappointing read. I would not recommend this book to others.
