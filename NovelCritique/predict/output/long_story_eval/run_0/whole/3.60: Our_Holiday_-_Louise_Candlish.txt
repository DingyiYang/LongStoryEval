### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist at the end was predictable, and the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them or care about their fates.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly descriptive and others lacking sufficient detail.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting was well-developed, but the characters' actions and motivations felt unrealistic and inconsistent with the town's dynamics.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of gentrification and activism were intriguing but underdeveloped, leaving much to be desired.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story to be a slow and unengaging read, with too much repetition and not enough meaningful progression.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, but it ultimately failed to deliver on its promise.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, this book was a disappointing read. Despite its intriguing premise, the story lacked depth, consistency, and emotional resonance. The pacing was uneven, the characters were underdeveloped, and the plot twist was predictable. While the setting was well-done, the rest of the book fell short of expectations.

### Score: 2.5
