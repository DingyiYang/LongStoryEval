### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story was engaging, but the pacing felt uneven, with some sections dragging on while others moved too quickly.

**Characters:**
Keyanna's journey from a naive outsider to a confident, powerful woman was compelling. Her growth and the way she navigated her family's dark legacy were well-developed. Lachlan's transformation from a kelpie-like creature to a loving partner was also satisfying. However, the supporting characters, such as Brodie and Rhona, felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more depth and complexity.

**Writing and Language:**
The author's writing style was engaging, and the dialogue was well-executed, making the characters feel authentic and relatable.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The Scottish setting was beautifully described, immersing me in the world and enhancing the overall experience.

**Themes:**
The story effectively explored themes of family, forgiveness, and the power of love to overcome curses and legacies.

**Emotional Impact:**
The emotional depth of the story was a standout, particularly in Keyanna's journey and her relationship with Lachlan.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found it hard to put down. The engaging plot and well-developed characters kept me invested throughout.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, and the author's ability to weave a compelling narrative kept me hooked from start to finish.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author's writing style, the emotional depth of the story, and the well-developed characters made it a memorable read. While the pacing and supporting characters could have been improved, the book's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses. I'm excited to see what the author writes next.
