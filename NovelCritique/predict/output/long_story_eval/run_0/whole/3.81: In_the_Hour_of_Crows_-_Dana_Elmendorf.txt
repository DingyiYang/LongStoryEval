### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The mystery surrounding Adaire's death was intriguing, but the resolution felt rushed and lacked the depth I had hoped for.

**Characters:**
Weatherly's journey from a passive participant to an empowered individual was compelling, and her growth was well-executed. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of magical realism added a unique and captivating layer to the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The Appalachian setting was vividly portrayed, and the magical realism elements added depth to the world-building.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of family dynamics, legacy, and the weight of secrets was both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.

**Emotional Impact:**
The novel's emotional depth was a standout, particularly in its portrayal of Weatherly's journey and the impact of Adaire's death on the family.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel's unique blend of magical realism and mystery kept me engaged, even when the pacing was uneven.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was drawn to this book by its unique premise and the promise of a magical realism-infused mystery. While it delivered on the latter, the former felt underdeveloped.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed the novel's unique premise, magical realism elements, and emotional depth. However, the uneven pacing, lack of depth in supporting characters, and rushed resolution of the mystery left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the story's exploration of family dynamics and legacy made it a memorable read.

### Score: 3.5
