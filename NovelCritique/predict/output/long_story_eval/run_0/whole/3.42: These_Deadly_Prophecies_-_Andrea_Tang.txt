### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The murder mystery was intriguing, but the resolution felt rushed and lacked sufficient buildup.

**Characters:**
Tabatha's character development was lacking, as she remained largely one-dimensional throughout the story. The supporting characters, particularly Circe, were more engaging and added depth to the narrative.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of humor and wit added a refreshing touch to the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was impressive, with a richly detailed magical system that added depth to the narrative.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of family dynamics and the consequences of prophecy was compelling, though it could have been more thoroughly developed.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by its rushed resolution and lack of character development.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The story was enjoyable, but its flaws prevented it from being truly memorable.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, but it ultimately fell short of its potential.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had an intriguing premise and a richly detailed magical system, its inconsistent pacing, rushed resolution, and lack of character development held it back from being a truly memorable read. The supporting characters, particularly Circe, were highlights, but Tabatha's underdevelopment left much to be desired.

### Score: 3.5
