### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The mystery surrounding Frances's murder was intriguing, but the resolution felt rushed and lacked the depth I had hoped for.

**Characters:**
Annie's character development was lacking, and her motivations for solving the mystery felt underdeveloped. The supporting characters, such as Detective Crane, were well-written and added depth to the story.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of multiple timelines added depth to the narrative.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the English country fair and the sprawling estate was vividly described, immersing me in the story's atmosphere.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of family, betrayal, and the cyclical nature of violence, which were thought-provoking and well-executed.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by the rushed resolution and lack of character development.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story engaging, but the uneven pacing and rushed resolution left me wanting more.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, which promised a unique blend of mystery and family drama. While the story delivered on its promise, it fell short in execution.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I found the novel to be an engaging read with a unique premise and well-executed themes. However, the uneven pacing, rushed resolution, and lack of character development left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the story's emotional depth and vivid setting made it a worthwhile experience.

### Score: 3.5
