### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story is engaging, but the pacing occasionally falters, making it feel overly long. The plot twist involving Greg's reappearance is intriguing, but the resolution feels rushed and lacks sufficient buildup.

**Characters:**
The characters are well-developed, and their interactions are engaging. However, the introduction of new characters, such as PT, feels unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the story.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing is strong, and the author's signature style shines through. However, the excessive use of the phrase "I'm going to kill you" becomes repetitive and annoying.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting is well-crafted, and the author's ability to transport readers to the world of sports and celebrity culture is impressive.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of justice, redemption, and the complexities of human relationships, which are thought-provoking and well-executed.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story is emotionally resonant, particularly in its portrayal of Myron's struggles with his family and his quest for justice.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel is a quick and enjoyable read, with a fast-paced narrative that keeps readers engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel delivers on its promise of a thrilling mystery, but the execution could have been more polished.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, this is a solid addition to the Myron Bolitar series, with strong character development, engaging themes, and a well-crafted setting. However, the pacing issues, repetitive dialogue, and unnecessary character introductions hold it back from being a truly exceptional read.

### Score: 3.5
