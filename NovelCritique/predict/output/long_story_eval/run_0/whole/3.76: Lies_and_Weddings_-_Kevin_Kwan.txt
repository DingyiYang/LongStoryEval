### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Eden's true lineage was both surprising and well-executed, but the resolution of the Gresham family's financial crisis felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
The characters were well-developed, and their relationships were engaging. However, the romance between Rufus and Eden felt rushed, and their relationship lacked sufficient buildup. Additionally, the portrayal of the wealthy elite was overly caricatured, making it difficult to take the story seriously.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of humor and satire added depth to the narrative.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The Hawaiian setting was vividly described, but the inclusion of other locations, such as Marrakech and Venice, felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall story.

**Themes:**
The novel effectively explores themes of family, love, and the consequences of one's actions.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story elicited strong emotions, particularly through the portrayal of the Gresham family's struggles and the revelation of Eden's true lineage.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel was an enjoyable read, with moments of humor and satire that kept me engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel's premise was intriguing, and the author's use of satire and humor added depth to the story.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed the novel's humor, satire, and emotional depth, but the uneven pacing, rushed romance, and overly caricatured portrayal of the wealthy elite detracted from the experience. The plot twist involving Eden's true lineage was a highlight, but the resolution of the Gresham family's financial crisis felt rushed. Despite these flaws, the story was engaging and left me wanting more.

### Score: 3.5
