### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot was predictable, and the mystery surrounding the helicopter crash lacked depth, making it feel underdeveloped.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them. Amalie's backstory was underutilized, and her relationship with Sean felt rushed and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the overall flow of the story. The frequent use of "said" and "thought" tags disrupted the narrative, making it feel clunky.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Jubilee, Kentucky, was underutilized, and the town's charm was not effectively showcased.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of family, love, and redemption were promising but ultimately fell flat due to the lack of character development and a well-executed plot.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the intended emotional response, as the characters and their relationships lacked depth and authenticity.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, which made it difficult to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, the book failed to meet my expectations due to its predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional depth. While the premise was intriguing, the execution left much to be desired. I would not recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
