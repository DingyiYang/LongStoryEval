### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the goddess's true intentions was both surprising and intriguing, but it could have been more effectively developed.

**Characters:**
Nora's character development was impressive, as she evolved from a curious investigator to a resilient survivor. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a personal level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of dark magic and occult themes added a unique and captivating layer to the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The small-town setting was well-executed, creating a sense of isolation and mystery that enhanced the overall atmosphere.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of toxic friendships and the occult was both intriguing and well-executed. The theme of childhood play and its connection to dark magic added a unique and compelling layer to the narrative.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional depth was a standout, particularly in Nora's journey of healing and acceptance. The portrayal of toxic friendships and the aftermath of trauma was both realistic and impactful.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The story was engaging, but the uneven pacing and lack of depth in supporting characters made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, blending horror and fantasy elements with a small-town mystery. However, the execution fell short of my expectations, particularly in terms of character development and plot resolution.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I found the book to be an engaging read with a unique premise and strong emotional depth. However, the uneven pacing, lack of character development, and underdeveloped plot twist left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the story's exploration of toxic friendships and dark magic made it a worthwhile read.
