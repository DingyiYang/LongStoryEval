### Review:
**Characters:**
The characters are underdeveloped, with many feeling like mere caricatures. The protagonist, Charlie Parker, lacks depth and is often overshadowed by the numerous other characters. The romance subplot between Parker and Sabine is particularly cringeworthy and feels forced.
