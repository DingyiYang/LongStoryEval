### Review:
**Characters:**
Paedyn's character development was impressive, and her journey from vengeance to self-discovery was compelling. However, Kai's transformation felt rushed, and his internal conflict lacked depth. The romance between Paedyn and Kai was sweet but underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more emotional connection between them.
