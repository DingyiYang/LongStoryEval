### Review:
**Characters:**
Katie and Aster are well-developed characters, each grappling with their own challenges. Katie's journey of healing and growth is particularly compelling, as she confronts her past and learns to trust herself. The supporting characters, including Riley and Finn, add depth to the story, though their motivations and actions can be somewhat confusing at times.
