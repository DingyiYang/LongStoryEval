### Review:
**Characters:**
Molly's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from a hangover-addled mess to a determined truth-seeker. The romantic subplot between Molly and Jack felt forced and lacked chemistry, making it difficult to invest in their relationship.
