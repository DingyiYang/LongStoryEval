### Review:
**Characters:**
Keyanna's journey from a naive outsider to a confident, powerful woman was compelling. Her growth and the way she navigated her family's dark legacy were well-developed. Lachlan's transformation from a kelpie-like creature to a loving partner was also satisfying. However, the supporting characters, such as Brodie and Rhona, felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more depth and complexity.
