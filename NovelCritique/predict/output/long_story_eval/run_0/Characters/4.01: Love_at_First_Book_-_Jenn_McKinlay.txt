### Review:
**Characters:**
Emily's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from a bookworm to a more adventurous individual. Kieran's transformation from a grumpy character to a romantic interest felt rushed and lacked depth. The supporting characters, such as Siobhan and the villagers, were well-developed and added significant depth to the story.
