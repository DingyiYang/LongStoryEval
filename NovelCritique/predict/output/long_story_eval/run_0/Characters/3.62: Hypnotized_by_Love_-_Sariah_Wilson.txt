### Review:
**Characters:**
Savannah's character development was inconsistent, as she often reverted to her old self despite her growth. Mason's transformation was more believable, but his lack of effort to communicate with Savannah felt frustrating. The romance was sweet, but the lack of chemistry between the characters made it difficult to fully invest in their relationship.
