### Review:
**Characters:**
Harrow's character development was inconsistent, with her personality and motivations shifting throughout the story. Raith's amnesia was poorly executed, as he quickly regained his memories without any significant challenges. The romance between Harrow and Raith lacked chemistry and felt rushed, with their relationship developing too quickly.
