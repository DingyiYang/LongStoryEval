### Review:
**Characters:**
Nelah's character development was inconsistent, with her transformation from a passive victim to a powerful force feeling abrupt and unconvincing. The romantic subplot between Nelah and Janith was underdeveloped and lacked chemistry, making their relationship feel forced and unengaging.
