### Review:
**Characters:**
The characters were well-developed, and their relationships were engaging. However, the romance between Rufus and Eden felt rushed, and their relationship lacked sufficient buildup. Additionally, the portrayal of the wealthy elite was overly caricatured, making it difficult to take the story seriously.
