### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the ghost's identity was predictable, and the resolution of the conflict felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
Nelah's character development was inconsistent, with her transformation from a passive victim to a powerful force feeling abrupt and unconvincing. The romantic subplot between Nelah and Janith was underdeveloped and lacked chemistry, making their relationship feel forced and unengaging.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall impact. The frequent use of metaphors and similes felt excessive and often disrupted the flow of the narrative.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The futuristic setting was intriguing, but the world-building was lacking. The concept of a society where men control women's bodies through microchips was underdeveloped and left many questions unanswered.

**Themes:**
The novel's exploration of themes such as oppression, control, and rebellion was promising but ultimately fell short due to its execution.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the intended emotions, with the romantic subplot and Nelah's character development coming across as unconvincing.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself disengaged from the story, struggling to connect with the characters and their motivations.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, but it failed to deliver on its promise.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had an intriguing premise and some promising themes, it fell short in execution. The uneven pacing, underdeveloped world-building, and lack of emotional impact made it a disappointing read. The romantic subplot and Nelah's character development were particularly unconvincing, and the resolution of the conflict felt rushed and unsatisfying.

### Score: 2.5
