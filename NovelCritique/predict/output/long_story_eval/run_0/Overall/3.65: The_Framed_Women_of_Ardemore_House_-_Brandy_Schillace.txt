### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The mystery was intriguing, but the resolution was somewhat predictable, which diminished the overall impact.

**Characters:**
The protagonist, Jo, was well-developed and relatable, particularly in her struggles with neurodivergence and her journey of self-discovery. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a personal level.

**Writing and Language:**
The author's writing style was engaging, and the use of vivid descriptions effectively brought the setting to life. However, the pacing issues and lack of character development detracted from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The author's vivid descriptions of the English countryside and the Ardemore House created a captivating atmosphere, drawing me into the story's world.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of identity, family history, and self-discovery, which resonated with me. However, the execution of these themes felt uneven, with some elements being more compelling than others.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional depth was a highlight, particularly in Jo's journey of self-discovery and her connection to her family's history. However, the lack of character development and uneven pacing diminished the overall emotional impact.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story engaging, especially in its exploration of Jo's identity and her connection to her family's history. However, the uneven pacing and lack of character development made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the narrative.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's cozy mystery and historical elements, but the story ultimately fell short of my expectations. While it had its moments, the uneven pacing and lack of character development made it feel incomplete.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had its strengths, particularly in its vivid descriptions and emotional depth, it fell short in terms of pacing, character development, and overall execution. The story had potential but ultimately didn't meet my expectations.

### Score: 3.2
