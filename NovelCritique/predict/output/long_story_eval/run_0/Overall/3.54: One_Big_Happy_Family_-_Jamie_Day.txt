### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Bree's true identity was predictable, and the resolution of the conflict felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them. Charley's growth was underwhelming, and her relationship with Quinn felt forced and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall impact. The excessive use of adjectives and metaphors made the narrative feel overly dramatic and clich√©d.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the Precipice Hotel was intriguing, but the story failed to fully explore its potential. The hotel's history and the sisters' family dynamics were underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more.

**Themes:**
The novel's themes of family, revenge, and redemption were intriguing but poorly executed. The story lacked a clear moral or message, leaving me feeling unsatisfied.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested in the characters and their struggles.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disengaged from the story, struggling to stay interested in the characters and their actions.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, but it failed to deliver on its promise. The story lacked the depth and complexity I had hoped for.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this novel. Despite its intriguing premise, the story fell short in terms of character development, pacing, and emotional impact. The writing style was overly descriptive, and the plot twist was predictable. While the setting had potential, it was underutilized. I would not recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
