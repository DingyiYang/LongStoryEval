### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Callum's true identity was predictable, and the resolution of the mystery felt anticlimactic.

**Characters:**
Anna's character development was inconsistent, with her transformation from a grieving widow to a determined sleuth feeling abrupt and unrealistic. The supporting characters, including Cass and Rosa, were underdeveloped and lacked depth.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall flow. The frequent use of metaphors and similes felt excessive and often disrupted the narrative.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of The Sycamores was intriguing, but the lack of depth in the characters and their motivations made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world.

**Themes:**
The novel's exploration of grief and the complexities of human relationships was compelling, but it was overshadowed by the plot's flaws.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional depth was hindered by the lack of character development and the predictable plot twist.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, which made it difficult to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, but the execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had an intriguing premise and explored meaningful themes, its execution fell short due to inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a predictable plot twist. The overly descriptive writing style and lack of emotional depth further detracted from the experience. Overall, it was a disappointing read that failed to meet my expectations.

### Score: 2.5
