### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the CEO's nephew was predictable and lacked impact.

**Characters:**
Ember's character development was inconsistent, as she often reverted to her old habits despite her claims of growth. The romance between Ember and Danuwoa felt underdeveloped, lacking the depth and chemistry needed to make their relationship believable.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly dramatic and others lacking depth. The author's attempt to incorporate humor fell flat, and the dialogue often came across as forced.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Oklahoma City was underutilized, and the cultural elements were introduced too late in the story to have a significant impact.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of honesty and integrity were underdeveloped and lacked depth. The exploration of cultural identity and the challenges faced by Native Americans was also insufficient.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the intended emotions, particularly in the romance and character development. The emotional impact was diminished by the lack of depth and consistency in the narrative.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The story was engaging at times, but the uneven pacing and lack of depth made it difficult to stay invested.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was promising, but the execution fell short of expectations. The author's debut novel showed potential, but it lacked the polish and depth needed to make it truly memorable.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had a promising premise and some engaging moments, it ultimately fell short due to inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of depth in its themes and cultural exploration. The romance and emotional impact were particularly disappointing, making it a mediocre read overall.

### Score: 2.5
