### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the killer's identity was predictable, and the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them or care about their fates. The romance subplot was particularly cringeworthy and felt out of place.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the story's overall impact. The frequent use of the phrase "the air was frigid" became repetitive and annoying.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Granite Harbor was intriguing, but the town's history and folklore were underdeveloped, leaving much to be desired.

**Themes:**
The novel's themes of small-town life and the supernatural were intriguing but not fully explored. The story's attempt to tackle serious issues like PTSD and child abuse fell flat due to its lack of depth and sensitivity.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling indifferent to the characters and their experiences.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, unable to engage with the characters or their struggles.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the novel's premise, but it failed to deliver on its promise. The supernatural elements were underutilized, and the story lacked the depth and tension I had hoped for.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this novel. Despite its intriguing premise, the story fell flat due to its lack of depth, inconsistent pacing, and underdeveloped characters. The writing style was overly descriptive, and the plot twist was predictable. While the setting had potential, it was not fully explored. I would not recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
