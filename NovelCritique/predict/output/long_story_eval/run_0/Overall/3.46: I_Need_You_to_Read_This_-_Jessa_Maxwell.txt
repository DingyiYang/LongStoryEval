### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The mystery was intriguing, but the resolution was predictable, and the twist was not as impactful as I had hoped.

**Characters:**
Alex's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from timid to bold. The supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery was impressive. However, the frequent use of "I need you to read this" became repetitive and distracting.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The New York Herald setting was well-executed, and the author's vivid descriptions of the city and its characters added depth to the story.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of trauma, resilience, and the power of writing, which I found compelling. However, the execution of these themes was uneven, and the story could have benefited from more focus on these elements.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by its predictability and lack of character depth.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story engaging, but the inconsistent pacing and lack of character development made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the narrative.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book by its intriguing premise, but the execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had an intriguing premise and some strong writing moments, its inconsistent pacing, predictable mystery, and lack of character depth made it a mixed experience for me. The themes of trauma and resilience were compelling, but they could have been explored more deeply. Overall, it was an okay read, but not one that left a lasting impression.

### Score: 3.0
