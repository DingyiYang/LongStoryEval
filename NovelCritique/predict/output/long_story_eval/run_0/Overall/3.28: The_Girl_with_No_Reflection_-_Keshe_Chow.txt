### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot was predictable, and the ending lacked a satisfying conclusion.

**Characters:**
The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with them. The romance felt forced and unconvincing, which further diminished the story's potential.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the overall experience. The frequent use of "my lady" and "my lord" became repetitive and annoying.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was lacking, and the concept of the mirror world felt underdeveloped. The story's setting, particularly the palace, was poorly described, making it difficult to visualize.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of love and sacrifice were underdeveloped and lacked depth.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling indifferent.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, which made it difficult to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited about the book, but my expectations were quickly dashed. The cover and blurb promised a unique and captivating story, but it failed to deliver.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed with this book. The uneven pacing, lack of character development, and underwhelming world-building made it a struggle to finish. The romance was unconvincing, and the story's themes were poorly executed. While the cover and blurb initially piqued my interest, the book failed to deliver on its promises.

### Score: 2.5
