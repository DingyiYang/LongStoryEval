### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The novel's pacing is uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot is overly complex, featuring too many characters and subplots that fail to cohere. The ending, in particular, is disappointing, as it fails to provide a satisfying resolution to the mystery.

**Characters:**
The characters are underdeveloped, with many feeling like mere caricatures. The protagonist, Charlie Parker, lacks depth and is often overshadowed by the numerous other characters. The romance subplot between Parker and Sabine is particularly cringeworthy and feels forced.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing is overly verbose, with excessive descriptions that fail to enhance the story. The author's tendency to explain everything detracts from the mystery, making it feel predictable and lacking in tension.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Maine is vividly described, but the excessive focus on the town's history and architecture detracts from the main plot.

**Themes:**
The novel attempts to tackle complex themes such as racism, xenophobia, and the far-right, but these elements feel forced and underdeveloped. The author's attempts to address these issues come across as heavy-handed and lacking in nuance.

**Emotional Impact:**
The novel fails to evoke any significant emotions, as the characters and plot are too shallow to resonate with readers.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, unable to engage with the characters or plot.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was excited to read this novel, but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. The author's previous works, such as *The Fisherman* and *The Rust Maidens*, were much stronger and more engaging.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this novel. The overly complex plot, underdeveloped characters, and heavy-handed themes made it a chore to read. The writing style, while descriptive, felt excessive and detracted from the story. The ending was particularly disappointing, leaving me feeling unsatisfied. I would not recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
