### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Dante's past was both surprising and impactful, but it felt somewhat rushed, leaving me wanting more depth.

**Characters:**
Lennon's character development was impressive, and her growth throughout the story was well-executed. However, the supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a personal level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery was particularly impressive. However, the excessive use of metaphors at times felt overwhelming and detracted from the overall flow.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The Gothic atmosphere was captivating, and the setting of Drayton College was well-developed. However, the world-building felt incomplete, leaving me with unanswered questions about the school's history and the broader magical community.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of power, control, and the corrupting influence of both was thought-provoking. However, the themes of love and sacrifice felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more depth.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was significant, particularly in the final chapters. However, the rushed resolution of Dante's past left me feeling unsatisfied.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the story engaging, but the uneven pacing and lack of depth in certain areas made it difficult to fully immerse myself.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, but the execution fell short of my expectations. While the story had potential, it didn't quite meet my hopes.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I found the book to be an engaging read with strong writing and a compelling premise. However, the uneven pacing, lack of depth in world-building and character development, and rushed resolution of certain plot points left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the story's emotional impact and exploration of power and control made it a worthwhile read.

### Score: 3.5
