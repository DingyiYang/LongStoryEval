### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Posey's death was predictable, and the resolution of the mystery was unsatisfying, leaving me feeling disappointed.

**Characters:**
Molly's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from a hangover-addled mess to a determined truth-seeker. The romantic subplot between Molly and Jack felt forced and lacked chemistry, making it difficult to invest in their relationship.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly dramatic and others lacking depth. The frequent use of Molly's inner monologue became repetitive and annoying.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of the story was underdeveloped, lacking the depth and richness needed to fully immerse me in the world.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of friendship and betrayal were compelling, but they were overshadowed by the predictable plot and lackluster execution.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the emotional response I was hoping for, leaving me feeling disconnected from the characters and their struggles.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, struggling to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, but it failed to deliver on its promise. The story's execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this book. Despite its promising premise, the inconsistent writing, predictable plot, and lackluster execution made it a struggle to finish. While the themes of friendship and betrayal were interesting, they were not enough to save the story from its overall shortcomings.

### Score: 2.5
