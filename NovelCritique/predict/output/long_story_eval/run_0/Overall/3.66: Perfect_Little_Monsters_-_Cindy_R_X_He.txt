### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist at the end was predictable and lacked the surprise I had hoped for.

**Characters:**
The protagonist's descent into madness was compelling, but the supporting characters lacked depth and development. The main antagonist's motivations were unclear, making it difficult to connect with their actions.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of language effectively conveyed the protagonist's mental state.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The high school setting was well-executed, but the lack of detail about the protagonist's past and her family's history made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story.

**Themes:**
The novel effectively explores the theme of bullying and its lasting impact on individuals. However, the portrayal of the protagonist's mental health issues felt somewhat superficial.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by the lack of depth in the protagonist's past and the underdeveloped supporting characters.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel had a strong start, but the inconsistent pacing and lack of surprises made it difficult to maintain my engagement.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, but the execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had a strong start and effectively explored the theme of bullying, its inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and lack of depth in the protagonist's past made it a disappointing read overall. The predictable plot twist and superficial portrayal of mental health issues further detracted from the experience.

### Score: 2.5
