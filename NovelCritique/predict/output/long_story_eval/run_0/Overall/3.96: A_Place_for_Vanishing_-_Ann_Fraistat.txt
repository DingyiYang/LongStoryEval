### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the masks was intriguing, but the resolution felt rushed and lacked sufficient buildup.

**Characters:**
Libby's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from a bipolar teenager to a gothic horror protagonist. The romance between Libby and Flynn felt forced and lacked chemistry, making their relationship unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, veering between a gothic horror tone and a teenage drama narrative. This mismatch made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The house was a standout element, with its eerie atmosphere and gothic architecture creating a compelling setting. However, the supernatural elements felt underdeveloped and lacked sufficient explanation.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of mental health and the gothic horror elements were intriguing, but they were not fully developed. The themes felt disjointed and lacked a cohesive narrative.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke the desired emotional response, as the characters and plot lacked depth and consistency.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, unable to fully engage with the characters or plot.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited about the book, but it failed to meet my expectations. The gothic horror elements were underdeveloped, and the story lacked a cohesive narrative.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this book. While the house and gothic atmosphere were intriguing, the inconsistent writing style, underdeveloped supernatural elements, and lack of emotional depth made it a frustrating read. I would not recommend it to others.

### Score: 2.5
