### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Celine's true identity was predictable and lacked surprise.

**Characters:**
Clove's character development was inconsistent, with her personality and motivations shifting abruptly throughout the story. The introduction of Celine's backstory felt rushed and underdeveloped, making it difficult to connect with her character.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was overly descriptive, which detracted from the overall flow of the story. The frequent use of metaphors and analogies, such as comparing violence to a "long reaching finger," felt forced and clich√©d.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The setting of Hawaii and Portland was vividly described, but the story's focus on Clove's past overshadowed the present-day locations.

**Themes:**
The novel's exploration of trauma, abuse, and the cycle of violence was impactful and well-executed. However, the themes were not consistently developed throughout the story.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional depth was hindered by the inconsistent character development and rushed plot elements.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel's slow start and uneven pacing made it difficult to stay engaged. The predictable plot twist and underdeveloped characters further diminished my enjoyment.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel's premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the novel had an intriguing premise and explored important themes, its execution fell short due to inconsistent character development, uneven pacing, and overly descriptive writing. The predictable plot twist and underdeveloped characters further diminished my enjoyment.

### Score: 2.5
