### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the "Jean-Jerks" was predictable and lacked surprise, while the ending felt rushed and left many questions unanswered.

**Characters:**
Clementine's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting between chapters. The romance between Clementine and Jude was underdeveloped and lacked chemistry, making their relationship feel forced and unconvincing.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some chapters feeling juvenile and others overly complex. The dialogue often came across as cheesy and unrealistic, detracting from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was lacking, with many elements introduced but not fully developed. The setting of Calder Academy felt underutilized, and the supernatural elements were introduced too late in the story.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of self-discovery and friendship were overshadowed by the romance, which felt forced and unconvincing.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected from the characters and their experiences.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disengaged from the story, struggling to stay invested in the characters and their journey.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short of my expectations. The story's potential was not fully realized, leaving me disappointed.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed with this book. The inconsistent writing style, underdeveloped characters, and lack of emotional impact made it a struggle to finish. While the premise was intriguing, the execution fell short, and I wouldn't recommend it to others.

### Score: 2.5
