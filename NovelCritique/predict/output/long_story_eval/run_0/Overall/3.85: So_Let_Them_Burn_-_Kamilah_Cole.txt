### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the First Dragon was predictable and lacked surprise, while the ending felt rushed and left many questions unanswered.

**Characters:**
The characters were well-developed, and their relationships added depth to the story. However, the romance subplot felt forced and unnecessary, detracting from the overall narrative.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing was engaging, and the author's use of Jamaican Patois added a unique and refreshing touch to the story.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was impressive, with a richly detailed and immersive setting that drew me in. The dragons were particularly well-crafted, and I appreciated the unique twist on traditional dragon lore.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of colonialism and the impact of war on civilians was thought-provoking and well-executed. However, the themes of colonialism and war felt somewhat underdeveloped, particularly in the second half of the book.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional depth was a standout, particularly in the moments of tenderness between the sisters. However, the romance subplot detracted from the overall emotional impact.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read, despite its flaws. The author's writing style and the unique world-building kept me engaged throughout.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially drawn to the book's premise, which promised a unique blend of Jamaican culture and fantasy. While the book delivered on this promise, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had its strengths, particularly in world-building, character development, and emotional depth, it fell short in pacing, plot execution, and thematic development. The romance subplot was a major distraction, and the ending left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the book was an enjoyable read, and I'm curious to see how the author will address these issues in future works.

### Score: 3.5
