### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Estela's parents was predictable and lacked surprise, while the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying.

**Characters:**
Estela's character development was inconsistent, with her personality shifting abruptly from a rebellious teenager to a mature, responsible individual. The romance between Estela and Sebasti√°n felt rushed and lacked chemistry, making it difficult to connect with their relationship.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly descriptive and others lacking depth. The dialogue often felt forced and unnatural, which detracted from the overall reading experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The castle setting was intriguing, but the world-building was lacking. The magical elements felt underdeveloped, and the rules governing the Bleeders and the castle's magic were unclear.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of family, trauma, and survival were compelling, but they were not fully explored. The focus on Estela's parents' death and her subsequent investigation overshadowed other important elements.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story's emotional impact was diminished by its lack of depth and consistency. The romance and character development failed to resonate with me.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disconnected from the story, which made it difficult to stay engaged.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited about the book, but my expectations were not met. The story failed to deliver on its potential, leaving me disappointed.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book had some intriguing elements, such as the castle setting and the themes of family and trauma, it ultimately fell short in terms of character development, world-building, and emotional impact. The inconsistent pacing, predictable plot twists, and rushed ending made it a disappointing read.

### Score: 2.5
