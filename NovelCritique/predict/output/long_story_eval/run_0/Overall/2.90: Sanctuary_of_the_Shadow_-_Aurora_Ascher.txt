### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving Raith's true identity was predictable, and the resolution of Harrow's past felt rushed and underdeveloped.

**Characters:**
Harrow's character development was inconsistent, with her personality and motivations shifting throughout the story. Raith's amnesia was poorly executed, as he quickly regained his memories without any significant challenges. The romance between Harrow and Raith lacked chemistry and felt rushed, with their relationship developing too quickly.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was inconsistent, with some sections feeling overly descriptive and others lacking depth. The dialogue was often cringe-worthy, and the use of clich√©s, such as "I love you, but I'm not in love with you," was frustrating.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was lacking, with the setting feeling underdeveloped and the magic system poorly explained. The circus setting was intriguing but underutilized.

**Themes:**
The story's themes of trauma, redemption, and love were promising but ultimately fell flat due to poor execution.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story failed to evoke any significant emotions, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninvested.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I found myself bored and disengaged from the story, struggling to stay interested.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was initially excited about the book, but my expectations were quickly dashed. The premise was intriguing, but the execution fell short.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I was disappointed by this book. Despite its promising premise, the story fell flat due to inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and poor execution of themes. The romance was lacking, and the world-building was insufficient. I wouldn't recommend this book to others.

### Score: 2.5
