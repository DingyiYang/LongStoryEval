### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot twist involving the prince's betrayal was predictable and lacked surprise.

**Characters:**
The protagonist, Aihui Ying, was well-developed and relatable, but her relationship with the prince felt underdeveloped. The supporting characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect with them.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery added depth to the narrative.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was impressive, with a richly detailed setting that drew me in. The inclusion of Chinese elements, such as the Engineers Guild and the High Command, added depth and authenticity to the story.

**Themes:**
The novel explores themes of ambition, power, and the consequences of one's actions, which are thought-provoking and well-executed.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story elicited strong emotions, particularly in the scenes where Ying confronts her father's murderer and the prince's betrayal. These moments were both intense and impactful.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
The novel was an enjoyable read, and I appreciated the author's debut effort. However, it fell short of being a standout in the YA fantasy genre.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The novel's premise was intriguing, and I was excited to dive into the story. However, the execution did not fully meet my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, Of Jade and Dragons is a solid debut novel with a strong premise, rich world-building, and engaging writing. However, the uneven pacing, predictable plot twists, and underdeveloped relationships left me wanting more. Despite these flaws, the story was enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing how the author improves in future works.

### Score: 3.5
