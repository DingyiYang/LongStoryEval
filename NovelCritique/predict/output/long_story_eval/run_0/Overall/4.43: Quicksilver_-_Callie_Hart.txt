### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story's pacing was inconsistent, with some sections feeling rushed and others dragging on. The plot was engaging, but the lack of a clear resolution left me feeling unsatisfied.

**Characters:**
Saeris's character development was inconsistent, with her personality and motivations shifting throughout the story. While the romance was enjoyable, it felt rushed and lacked depth.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing style was engaging, and the author's use of metaphors and imagery was impressive. However, the frequent use of "he said" and "she said" dialogue tags detracted from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building was impressive, with a richly detailed and immersive setting that drew me in. The unique magic system and the blend of fantasy and mythology elements were particularly standout features.

**Themes:**
The story's exploration of themes such as power, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions was thought-provoking and well-executed.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story elicited strong emotions, particularly in the scenes involving Saeris's mother and her struggles with her powers. However, the lack of a clear resolution left me feeling emotionally unsatisfied.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
I was thoroughly engaged in the story, and the author's writing style kept me hooked. However, the inconsistent pacing and lack of resolution left me feeling frustrated.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
I was excited to dive into this book, and the author's previous work had me expecting a high-quality read. While the story had potential, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.

### Overall Assessment:
Overall, I enjoyed the story's world-building, magic system, and themes, but the inconsistent pacing, rushed romance, and lack of resolution left me feeling frustrated. While the writing style was engaging, the frequent use of dialogue tags and Saeris's inconsistent character development detracted from the experience. Despite these flaws, I'm still excited to see where the story goes in the next installment.
