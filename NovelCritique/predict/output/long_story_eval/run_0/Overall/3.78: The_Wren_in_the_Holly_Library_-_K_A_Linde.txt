### Review:
**Plot and Structure:**
The story is engaging, but the pacing feels uneven, with some sections dragging on while others rush by. The plot is rich with potential, but it could benefit from more development to fully realize its potential.

**Characters:**
Kierse's character development is impressive, and her growth throughout the story is well-executed. However, the supporting characters lack depth, making it difficult to connect with them on a deeper level.

**Writing and Language:**
The writing is strong, and the author's use of language is engaging. However, the pacing issues and lack of character development detract from the overall experience.

**World-Building and Setting:**
The world-building is impressive, with a richly detailed magical system and a unique take on the fae. However, the setting feels underutilized, and the story could have benefited from more exploration of the world beyond the main characters.

**Themes:**
The story explores themes of identity, power, and the complexities of relationships, which are handled thoughtfully. However, the romance feels rushed and underdeveloped, leaving it feeling less impactful than it could have been.

**Emotional Impact:**
The story evokes strong emotions, particularly through Kierse's journey of self-discovery and her relationships with others. However, the romance and supporting characters lack the emotional depth needed to fully resonate.

**Enjoyment and Engagement:**
Overall, the story is engaging and enjoyable, but it falls short in certain areas. While it has potential, it could benefit from further development to reach its full potential.

**Expectation Fulfillment:**
The book's premise is intriguing, and the magical system is well-developed. However, the execution falls short in certain areas, particularly in pacing and character development.

### Overall Assessment:
While the book has a strong premise, impressive world-building, and a compelling protagonist, it falls short in pacing, character development, and emotional depth. The story is enjoyable but could have been more impactful with better execution. I'm excited to see how the author develops the story further in future installments.
