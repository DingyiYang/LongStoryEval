### Title: The Getaway List

### Genres: Romance, Young Adult, Contemporary

### Premise:
The day of her high school graduation, Riley realizes two things: One, that she has spent the last four years trying so hard to be a Good Kid for her mom that she has no idea who she really is anymore, and two, she has no idea what she wants because of it. The solution? Pack her bags and move to New York for the summer, where her childhood best friend Tom and co-creator of The Getaway List ― a list of all the adventures they’ve wanted to do together since he moved away ― will hopefully help her get in touch with her old adventurous self, and pave the road to a new future.
Riley isn’t sure what to expect from Tom, who has been distant since his famous mom’s scriptwriting career pulled him away. But when Riley arrives in the city, their reconnection is as effortless as it was when they were young―except with one, unexpected complication that will pull Riley’s feelings in a direction she didn’t know they could take. As she, Tom, and their newfound friends work their way through the delightfully chaotic items on The Getaway List, Riley learns that sometimes the biggest adventure is not one you take, but one you feel in your heart.

### Plot Summary:
Riley Larson, a recent high school graduate, embarks on a journey to New York City to explore independence and self-discovery through a guided "Getaway List." Reuniting with childhood friend Tom and her ex-boyfriend Jesse, she forms new bonds with spirited photographer Mariella and budding writer Luca. The city's vibrant backdrop sets the stage for Riley's emotional evolution as she contends with family pressures, creative aspirations, and deepening friendships. Throughout the summer, an anonymous admirer sends heartfelt gifts via the "Dear, Love" Dispatch app, which influences group dynamics. Riley discovers Tom's involvement, prompting her to reassess their relationship. However, rather than seeking romance, Riley commits to nurturing their friendship, reinforcing her sense of self-worth. Confrontations with Jesse encourage her to pursue honesty in her relationships, contributing to the complexity of her interactions with both Tom and others.
As Riley navigates these relationships, Mariella and Luca emerge as a romantic couple amid familial discoveries during an event dubbed Brownie Bonanza. Meanwhile, Tom's revelation of his mother's absence in New York preludes his impending departure, becoming a pivotal moment for the group and prompting Riley to confront her feelings for him. Despite confessing her long-standing affection, she prioritizes Tom's journey towards personal growth, spurring him to leave amid intimate confessions and emotional farewells. The parting ignites Riley's self-reflection, recognizing the transient yet profound bonds formed over the summer.
Following Tom's departure, Riley and her mother reconcile in New York, mending misunderstandings about her life choices, the significance of her friends, and her mother's own NYC youth. This dialogue brings clarity and motivation for Riley to stay in New York, balancing independence with familial love. Upon her mother’s visit, Riley becomes more attuned to the joys and challenges of city life, while Tom's absence leaves the group in search of equilibrium without their grounding force. As tensions surface between the friends, their collective decision invites them to reach out to Tom, highlighting his emotional and social value through shared memories and impactful contributions to the city.
In a bold move, the group travels to Tom’s aunt's winery in Virginia. They bring a scrapbook filled with their summer's adventures and "Dear, Love" stories, illustrating Tom’s efforts in knitting people together in New York. When Riley encounters Tom, poised to leave again, their laughter and emotional reunion rekindle his connection to the group. As he shares his intentions to resolve personal issues regarding his mother back in New York, Riley’s acknowledgment of their inseparable bond reassures him of the home they've built together with their friends. Ready to embrace the next chapter in their lives, the group, now reunited, returns to New York, celebrating the nurturing camaraderie and love that brought them closer together.
In the epilogue, Riley and her friends launch "The Getaway List" app, highlighting their growth and achievements. The project celebrates creativity and collaboration among Riley, Mariella, and Luca. Tom has embraced his role in their community and is preparing to celebrate his anniversary with Riley through a camping trip, symbolizing a new beginning for their relationship. Their journey culminates in understanding home as a feeling rather than a place, capturing the essence of self-discovery, friendship, and the resilience that brought them to this point.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
If you think about it, getting rejected from all ten colleges I applied to is quite the feat. I did that whole thing where I picked three “shoo-in” schools, three maybes, and three reaches—even threw in a cheeky application to NYU, just in case a rich distant relative died and left me a zillion dollars for tuition—and got back a slew of “Thank you, but” emails and very thin envelopes addressed to one Riley Larson. Sure, our poor mailman hasn’t looked me in the eye since April, but you know what? Statistically speaking, it makes me kind of a big deal.
My mom is not especially pleased that I turned the rejection letters into a paper-mache collage and stuck it on my graduation cap, but I’ve been a mostly model kid as of late. Not to mention I just conceded my entire summer to helping her at the coffee shop. I’m entitled to a little teenage rebellion. Plus after four long years of sleep deprivation, GPA-related tears, and enduring the humiliation of having a literal earthworm as a school mascot (don’t ask), the students of Falls Creek High deserve some comic relief. I’m only doing my part.
I slide past my classmates toward my seat with the rest of the L last names, sandwiched between an already tipsy Elle Lake (in-state school) and a very grim Chet Lawrence (Harvard, the nerd). The school has apparently placed tiny packs of gummy worms on our seats. A little on the nose, but after I unwrap mine I raise a bright green worm and say, “To getting the hell out of here.”
A good number of classmates join me in this nonsense toast, though for me it comes with a slight bitter taste even a lime-flavored gummy worm can’t wash down. Most of them are getting out of here. Far as I know, I’m going to be stuck in Falls Creek until I Falls Croak.
Before I can indulge in another pity party I scan the crowd of parents behind us for my mom, who in true mom fashion somehow got here before I did. She’ll be somewhere in the front row and because of that I’ve already texted her a list of kids a mile wide who have asked her to record them walking across the stage. She’s happy to do it. Nobody loves a mission more than my mom does. Hell, she’ll probably just do the whole five-hundred-kid graduating class “just in case.”
Before I can find my mom my phone hums to life in my lap with a message from, of all people, Tom.
They’re livestreaming this. Don’t fuck up.
My face blooms with an immediate warmth, a smile tugging at my lips. Tom is my all-time best but also worst friend—best because we would literally die for each other, and worst because in the last year he’s texted with the frequency of a prehistoric rock.
Does the blue of this graduation gown make my existential terror pop?
