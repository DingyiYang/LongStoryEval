### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Linz, Austria, Saturday 12 March 1938
The tram trundled away from the platform, the wooden carriages mellow gold in the late-afternoon sunshine. Ella slowed from her sprint as she watched the tram disappear through the stone arch and down the steep hill. She let out an exasperated sigh. Now she would be late, and she only had herself to blame.
He was coming to Linz. The man himself. The town was buzzing with nervous energy. Everyone would be fighting for a good view when he arrived. And what had she been doing? She had been wandering amongst the swathes of snowdrops, dreaming of spring and picnics to come, up here on the Pöstlingberg. In summer, secretarial school would be over, and she would turn twenty-one. An adult. Her life was opening up like an alpine rose. She had stood in front of the brick house that was her former primary school, reminiscing. From there, she’d looked down on the majestic river Danube, glassy grey, flecked with silver, weaving its way through Linz.
The next tram wasn’t for another hour. She crossed the track, and sped down the steep gravel path that wound down the mountainside. As a child, she’d never had money for the tram and had walked this route twice a day for five years.
She’d wanted to get a place near the front when he came, but as the bells from the grand church atop the Pöstlingberg chimed five o’clock, she knew the crowds would already be gathered below in the town square.
She descended past rustic chalets that clung to the hillside, their flowerboxes empty. Spring would soon be here; the flowerboxes filled with trailing red geraniums and ivy, and hanging baskets would burst with violet petunias. There were grand white stone villas too, boasting balconies with views over the mighty Danube, the life blood of Linz.
Thirty minutes later, she arrived home, her shoes covered in mud, and the hem of her long wool coat soaked through. Home was a small three-storey apartment block adorned with window shutters and flowerboxes.
The rich smell of goulash greeted her as she opened the front door, but she would have to eat later, for her parents stood waiting in the hallway wearing coats, hats and grim expressions.
‘Where on earth have you been?’ said her father. ‘What will people think of us when we don’t show our respect?’
‘Sorry, Vati,’ Ella said, grabbing her beret off the hook on the wall and linking her arm in her mother’s. ‘Let’s go.’
It was already dark as they crossed the Donaubrücke over the Danube and approached the town centre. Ella’s father strode ahead.
She turned to her mother. ‘I don’t know why Vati is so bothered to be here. He doesn’t even like the man. It’s all about appearances, I suppose.’
