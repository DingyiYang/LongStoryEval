### Plot Summary:
By December, Bette is engulfed in her busiest period at work, juggling long hours due to covering events for a colleague on honeymoon. Amid this professional chaos, she navigates personal complexities, attempting to maintain connections with her partner Ash and family, particularly her nonna. Her loneliness compels her to seek community at a queer meet-up, where she encounters Heather, reigniting emotional turbulence from her unresolved relationship with Ruth. Heather reveals that Ruth is also struggling emotionally, prompting Bette to reconsider keeping her distance. Ash, ever supportive, helps Bette process her emotions, encouraging her to confront Ruth.
During a Christmas gathering organized by Ash, Bette experiences the supportive embrace of her friends and realizes the need to take action concerning Ruth. Encouragement from her circle of friends propels her to express her feelings directly to Ruth, leading to an impromptu plan to declare them at Portishead Beach. Despite Ruth’s initial reluctance, she joins Bette, resulting in a vulnerable exchange of feelings that sees Ruth choosing to metaphorically jump alongside Bette into their relationship. This moment marks a significant step in their reconciliation, leaving Bette hopeful for their future.
As New Year’s Eve arrives, Bette and her friends partake in Ash’s cherished tradition of writing down twelve hopes for the upcoming year. During this, Bette reflects on her relationship with Ruth and the changes she desires in her life, such as taking a walking holiday with Ruth, visiting her nonna regularly, and planning a future with Ash. She realizes her longing to become a present and supportive figure in her family’s life and envisions achieving these goals in the coming year. As the evening progresses towards midnight, they plan to burn the discarded hopes and internalize the one paper each person keeps. In a moment of intimacy as the fireworks begin, Bette finally shares with Ruth that her last year’s resolution was to fall in love and be together. Ruth reciprocates the sentiment, solidifying their renewed relationship and mutual hopes for the future.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The conversation started, appropriately enough, in Mei’s bed. It was a hot summer morning in mid-July, the light streaming in like a cliché through gauze curtains and warming Bette’s skin. There was an undeniable luxury about being in bed together like this during the summer; they’d had long hours the evening before to take their time in the last of the daylight, to appreciate the golden glow on each other’s skin.
As a general rule, Bette hated being sweaty, hated the summer. Her body felt big in the heat, like she took up too much space, as plump and warm as a rising ball of dough. But there was something—there was everything—about being there with Mei, about being flushed and warm in her linen sheets, that made her happy to overlook it.
There was a plan, at some point soon, for Bette to meet friends in the park, to enjoy the sun while they had it. But when she and Mei blinked awake around eight, the afternoon seemed so blissfully distant. They felt no rush at all. Mei disappeared to make tea, and Bette…Bette missed her. She’d been gone no more than ten minutes, just in the next room. Bette had heard her turn the radio on, had heard her fill the kettle with water. And still, she missed her. And so, quite without thinking how ridiculous it was, quite how soon she’d be back, Bette climbed out from beneath the sheet and followed her in.
She found Mei at the sink, looking out of the window, head tilted, fingers pressing into the top of her spine, where she was always tense after a week in the studio. One side of her robe had slipped off her shoulder, and she was humming along to something on the radio Bette could only identify as “misc. classical.” Bette stepped close behind Mei, her lips finding Mei’s neck, where her fingers had been. Still humming, Mei tilted her head, reaching back and working her fingers into Bette’s hair, directing Bette to tug at an earlobe with her teeth, to trail her mouth around to the hinge of Mei’s jaw. Bette pulled at the knot on Mei’s robe, turned her and lifted her up onto the kitchen surface, right next to the pot of still-brewing tea. Mei raised an eyebrow as her eyes traveled down Bette’s body; she was standing naked in Mei’s kitchen, as though that were a thing Bette did with lots of people, as though this wasn’t the latest in a long line of firsts. As though Mei wasn’t entirely aware of all of the ways in which this was new.
