Whip-smart and immersive, this Jamaican-inspired fantasy follows a gods-blessed heroine who’s forced to choose between saving her sister or protecting her homeland.
 
Faron Vincent can channel the power of the gods. Five years ago, she used her divine magic to liberate her island from its enemies, the dragon-riding Langley Empire. But now, at seventeen, Faron is all powered up with no wars to fight. She’s a legend to her people and a nuisance to her neighbors.
 
When she’s forced to attend an international peace summit, Faron expects that she will perform tricks like a trained pet and then go home. She doesn’t expect her older sister, Elara, forming an unprecedented bond with an enemy dragon—or the gods claiming the only way to break that bond is to kill her sister.
 
As Faron’s desperation to find another solution takes her down a dark path, and Elara discovers the shocking secrets at the heart of the Langley Empire, both must make difficult choices that will shape each other’s lives, as well as the fate of their world.

### Plot Summary:
Following the historic conflict between San Irie and Langley, sisters Elara and Faron Vincent find themselves at the center of intensifying divine, magical, and geopolitical stakes that threaten global harmony. At Langley's prestigious Hearthstone Academy, Elara becomes embroiled in espionage and diplomacy, uncovering Langley's dark aspirations to resurrect the First Dragon and exploit the Fury—a disastrous prophecy-linked dragon curse. Amid betrayal and intrigue, Elara's alliance with Signey Soto deepens, particularly as her father's involvement in Langley's schemes comes to light.
Under divine tutelage, Faron Vincent embraces her identity as the Childe Empyrean, mastering celestial powers with guidance from Gael Soto. Her growing bond with Reeve Warwick, son of a Langlish figurehead, complicates matters as he aids the Vincents against Langley's schemes. However, Gael's true nature as Iya, the Gray Saint with potent aspirations for dominion, dismantles fragile alliances and propels Faron into chaos.
In the present, Elara and Signey narrowly flee perilous situations, empowered when Faron severs Elara’s limited magical bond, unveiling her full potential. Together, they seek Queen Aveline's support to ready San Irie against impending threats. Confronting dragons and unravelling manipulative plots, their courage signifies hope for their homeland.
Faron witnesses the rise of the First Dragon, manipulated by Iya—who now inhabits Reeve's form—casting San Irie into turmoil. Her path marked by guilt and revelation, Faron is caught between divine duties and the need to atone for past errors. Iya’s manipulation leads her to a pivotal choice that could reshape destiny. Ultimately, Faron aligns with him hoping to save Reeve, while San Irie’s fate hangs by Elara's newfound empowerment.
Amid battles, Aveline fiercely confronts Lightbringer, projecting raw magical prowess driven by fury and love for her island. In her absence, Faron and Signey combat the dragons, showcasing Faron's hesitantly developed divine control as they shield Nobility, facilitating the queen’s strategic position.
Elara's journey takes her to the gods at Port Sol Temple, seeking intervention. She learns of Iya’s origin as the first Empyrean and his binding with Lightbringer. Despite the gods' insistence on dire solutions, her resolve to find an alternative earns her the title of Maiden Empyrean, and the bestowed power fuels her determination to protect her world and sister.
Simultaneously, Faron confronts Iya in San Irie's throne room, reaching out to any trace of humanity within Gael. A formidable mix of regret and hope compels her to extend an olive branch, aiming to liberate Gael and Reeve from Iya’s shadow. Ultimately, she sacrifices her presence alongside Elara, leaving with Iya on Lightbringer in a gambit to find Lightbringer’s weakness and remedy san Irie’s suffering. Elara is left bearing the mantle of the island's last hope, grounded in her belief in unity and redemption.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
FARON VINCENT HAD BEEN A LIAR FOR LONGER THAN SHE’D BEEN A saint.
She’d learned from a young age that lies were a form of currency. They could buy freedom and earn forgiveness. They could alter reality faster than any kind of magic. A lie well told was itself magical, and Faron was nothing if not convincing.
She’d told three lies since this morning, and they’d each felt like a spell. She’d told her teacher that she’d try harder to bring up her grades before the end of the year. She’d promised her sister that she would go straight home after classes were over. And she’d sworn that she wouldn’t use summoning to beat Jordan Simmons in this race.
Was it her fault they always believed her?
To be fair, Faron didn’t always know she was lying in the moment. She’d intended to keep at least two of those promises—maybe all three, if she felt like acting particularly respectable. Then someone had spread around the schoolyard that she would be missing class to attend the Summit, and trouble had found her in the form of Jordan Simmons.
While the adults across the island of San Irie considered Faron a holy child, the same could not be said of her schoolmates. Jordan had approached her outside the gates, where she’d been standing in line to buy bag juice. The weather was the kind of hot that made her sorry to even be alive, and rolling up the sleeves of her shirtwaist had offered no relief. Faron had been watching the frost clouds curling from the vendor’s open cart with such longing that she hadn’t noticed Jordan until he was inches away from her.
“Missing school again, Vincent?” he’d sneered, flanked by two other fifth-form boys. Their horselike snickers had been a discordant note in her otherwise harmonious day. To anyone else, this might have signaled danger ahead. Faron, on the other hand, had only been bored. “Being the Empyrean is quite the con, isn’t it?”
“If it were a good con,” Faron had said without turning around, “then I wouldn’t still be smelling the dung that comes out of your mouth.”
She hadn’t bothered to mention the reality of war or the lingering nightmares or the heavy expectations that came with being the Childe Empyrean. Five years ago, when the gods had first given her that title and the unique ability to summon their infinite magic, she had only been thinking of protecting San Irie. She hadn’t realized what she was signing up for—or what she was signing away.
But even if she’d wanted to get into all of that with anyone, Jordan and his gang would have only used it against her. No one wanted to hear that being chosen by the gods to save the world was a curse rather than a blessing. She was a symbol, and symbols didn’t complain.
