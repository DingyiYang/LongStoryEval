As they do each June, the Foxes have driven the winding roads of Appalachia to drop off their children for a two-week stay at their grandmother’s.

But as her parents head back to suburban Virginia, they have no idea they’re about to cross paths with a ticking time bomb.
Back in Kentucky, Thea and her grandmother Lucy both awaken from the same nightmare. And though the two have never discussed the special kind of sight they share, they know as soon as their tearful eyes meet that something terrible has happened.

### Plot Summary:
In Redbud Hollow, Kentucky, Thea Fox, a psychic and game designer, balances the trauma from her parents' murder by Ray Riggs, a powerful psychic with an obsession with her. She finds solace in her family—her caring grandmother Lucy and protective brother Rem—and strives to rebuild her life in this peaceful setting. Tyler Brennan, a former rock star and single father, moves to the town seeking stability for himself and his son, Bray. Tyler and Thea form a bond over shared experiences, complicated initially by misunderstandings regarding Thea's psychic abilities. Tyler comes to terms with the true burden of Thea’s psychic connection to Riggs, which affects her deeply, exemplified by a panic attack resulting from Riggs’s torment.
Thea demonstrates resolve and bravery when she uses her psychic abilities to help Nadine, a fellow community member, find her missing daughter, Adalaide. This act reaffirms her strength and willingness to use her gift positively. The shared experience strengthens her bond with Tyler, leading to a commitment to a shared future. Despite their growing relationship, Thea remains haunted by Riggs’s influence. Determined to break this hold, she decides to confront him in prison directly, despite concerns from her family that this could empower Riggs.
Supported by Ty, Thea visits Riggs at Red Onion State Prison in Virginia. She prepares meticulously for the encounter, drawing strength from her community and dressing in a manner reminiscent of her mother to unsettle Riggs. During a mentally intense showdown in the prison, Thea uses her psychic power to lead Riggs through his life’s pivotal moments, highlighting his consistently harmful choices. This causes him to experience mental and physical pain, culminating in a stroke. Thea effectively imprisons what's left of Riggs's mind, ensuring he can never threaten her again.
Afterward, Thea emerges victorious, supported by Ty, who offers steadfast love and understanding. As they leave the prison, Ty reveals a song he wrote for Thea, cementing their relationship further. They plan a future together, integrating their lives and families, with visions of expanding their family and Tyler’s desire to revive his music career. The segment concludes with a sense of hope and new beginnings as Thea and Ty look forward to building a life together.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
For Thea, the very best part of summer started the second week of June. The last day of school earned a big red heart, and meant she could start swimming and splashing around in the backyard pool, which she loved. She could ride her bike and play with her friends every day. Though they didn’t call it playing anymore. Now they hung out.
She was twelve, after all.
She liked cookouts, and long summer days, and she especially liked no homework.
But every year, just about a week after that big red heart day, she piled in the car with her mom; her dad; her little brother, Rem; and their dog, Cocoa. They started the long drive from Fredericksburg, Virginia, to Redbud Hollow, Kentucky.
Her mom grew up there but had gone off to Virginia to college, where she met John Fox on the very first day in the very first class.
And the rest, like they said—or like her dad said—was history.
They married the summer after their sophomore year, and ten months, two weeks, and three days after, she’d come along. Not quite two years later, Rem popped out.
Now her dad designed houses and her mom decorated them. Their company, Fox and Fox Homes, did just fine.
She knew stuff. Grown-ups didn’t think kids knew much of anything important, but she did. She knew her grandparents, her dad’s parents, were rich and snooty, and didn’t think much of her mom—the girl from eastern Kentucky.
But her dad’s parents lived out in San Diego, so they didn’t have to see them much. Which was more than fine with Thea. She didn’t have to hear Grandmother—that was the snooty name they had to call her—think her thoughts about how her mom laughed too loud or would never shake the Appalachian dust off her shoes.
She could hear those thoughts if she tried hard enough, and when she had to visit Grandmother, she couldn’t seem to help it.
She thought so loud.
Grandmother and Grandfather didn’t seem to care that John and Cora Fox were happy, and even successful. That they all lived in a pretty house in a nice neighborhood. That Thea and Rem (or as they insisted, Althea and Remington) did even better than okay in school.
But Grammie cared. They all talked on the phone every week on Sunday, and at Christmastime, Grammie drove up with her truck full of presents she’d made. Most of the time her uncles Waylon and Caleb came, too, so they had a big family party, and the house was all full of music and lights and the smells of baking.
That was her second favorite time of the year.
But the best time, even though they had to drive for seven whole hours, and sometimes more, came in June.
