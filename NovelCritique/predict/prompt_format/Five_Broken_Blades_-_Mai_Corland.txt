### Plot Summary:
In the tumultuous realm of Yusan, deposed Prince Euyn, Mikail, and their band of rebels plan to overthrow the tyrannical King Joon during the tumultuous tuhko championship. Amidst rising political unrest, they aim for strategic assassination and Euyn's reinstatement, relying on secrecy and alliances. The mission is plagued by betrayal, especially as Aeri, a skilled thief, grapples with her loyalties due to her concealed identity as Joon's daughter. Sora's attempt to hasten Joon's demise via poisoning fails, and Mikail's plans are thwarted by Bay Chin's betrayal. The plot's unraveling exposes Royo to Aeri's deception, disrupting the rebellion further.
Captured and presented at Qali Palace, the rebels find they've walked into an elaborate trap orchestrated by Joon, who sought to test their skills for his own ends. With Aeri's personal agenda conflicting with the rebels' cause, they face new risks. Joon manipulates the situation to redirect their efforts, demanding they steal the Ring of Khitan within five weeks, promising rewards of power and redemption. Euyn weighs his motivations for royal reinstatement while managing newfound responsibilities as the group's leader.
The group's dynamics are fraught with tension. Mikail, burdened by his role as a strategist and his complex relationship with Euyn, navigates alliances amidst Joon’s machinations. Sora, emotionally tethered to her sister, faces overwhelming challenges as she juggles personal vendettas with the burdens of rebellion. Royo's trust is shattered, yet he remains focused on clearing injustices associated with his past. Aeri, torn by her duties as Joon's daughter, balances on a precipice of loyalty and betrayal.
Despite the concessions offered by Joon, the rebels consider the near-impossible nature of their new mission and Joon's threats, including dire consequences for failure. They realize Joon's fear of their sister Quilimar presents an opportunity; by leveraging this vulnerability, they hope to turn their dangerous predicament into a chance for empowerment and revenge.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
ROYO
CITY OF UMBRIA, YUSAN
Gold for blood—that’s my advertisement and the words I live by.
The merchant slowly counts out gold mun, his gloved hands shaking as each coin lands in his palm. He’s a little taller than me, but my shoulders are twice as wide.
“Hurry it up. I don’t got all night,” I say.
My deep voice startles him, and two bronze mun clatter onto the ground. He lets the coins roll away but pauses to consider chasing them down. Ten Hells. This is gonna take two lifetimes.
Finally, he slips the money into my hand, paying for the broken nose and leg. Then he darts away, fur-lined cape flapping in the night breeze. It’s not a noble living, being muscle for hire, but the upper class ain’t great neither.
I count my gold as I lumber between the soot-covered buildings. All there. I put the money in my coin purse and tuck it into my inner jacket pocket. Behind me, my latest victim whimpers in the darkness of the alley. If he keeps up that noise, the hael birds will peck him clean before morning. And the rich merchant prick didn’t pay for a kill.
“Can you stop that racket?” I say.
The whimpering dies down.
“Thank you,” I say. He’s silent—shut up by my manners or his pain.
I think about going back to help. I always think about it. But it’s none of my business. It’s not my problem, what happens after my jobs are done. Or why the merchant wanted to send a message in the first place.
Those are roads that lead nowhere. And I’ve got somewhere to be.
I blow a warm breath in my gnarled hands. This fucking cold. Frost shines on the cobbled streets, and the runoff has already started to freeze. What trees there are in this cramped city are long bare. Winter comes quick in Umbria. But then, death always does.
I should probably buy some warm gloves, but my stomach tightens at the thought of parting with even one silver mun. Every coin counts, and I don’t really need posh shit anyhow.
When I get to Inch Street, two well-dressed couples split around me. They’re all fur muffs and expensive, feathered hats. Swells. They give me a wide berth, then scurry away like I’m contagious or something. I guess if my size don’t intimidate people, the scar dividing my face does the trick. People stay away.
Good.
