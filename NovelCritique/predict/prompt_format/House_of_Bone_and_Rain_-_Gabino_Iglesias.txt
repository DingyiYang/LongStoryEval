For childhood friends Gabe, Xavier, Tavo, Paul, and Bimbo, death has always been close. Hurricanes. Car accidents. Gang violence. Suicide.

We’re gonna kill the guys who killed her 
Bimbo swears. And they all agree.

Following a devastating hurricane in Puerto Rico, Gabe and his friends navigate a post-apocalyptic landscape fraught with criminal undertakings and supernatural specters. Bimbo, driven by vengeance for his mother María's murder by the sinister criminal Papalote, involves Gabe, Tavo, Paul, and Altagracia in a quest that blends human-driven vendettas with mystic undertones. Their journey takes them into the domain of mythical sea creatures tied to Papalote, revealing a history of greed and exploitation. 
In their pursuit, they eliminate Papalote and El Brujo, the latter having employed dark witchcraft against them.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
—
Two bullets to the face
The wake
A baquiné
Brotherhood of the gun
The church of anger
The last day of classes, our last day as high school students, marked a new era for us. We wanted it. We feared it. We had plans for it. Then Bimbo’s mom hit the sidewalk with two bullet holes in her face, and the blood drowned out all those plans.
Bimbo called to tell us the day after it happened. His real name was Andrés, but we mostly called him Bimbo because he was brown and chubby and looked like the mascot bear of a brand of cookies. It’s normal for people to report the death of a parent. Old age. Cancer. A heart attack. Whatever. Old people die and we expect it, accept it even. It’s normal. Murder is different. Murder is a monster that chews up whatever expectations you had regarding death and spits them in your face. Murder is an attack on someone’s life, yes, but also an attack on those left behind.
When Bimbo called to tell me about the death of his mother, María, I felt attacked. “They shot my mom, man.” Five words about the recent past that were heavy enough to crush our future.
I said nothing because there was nothing to say. Death swallows words, or at least shows you how fucking useless they are.
María had been working the door at Lazer Club for a few years. All she did was check IDs and yell at the gorillas inside if anyone got belligerent. At least that’s what everyone thought. What most people didn’t know—and we knew only because we were Bimbo’s best friends—was that she also dealt on the side. But no judgment: mothers are sacred. Mine definitely is.
In the pregnant silence that followed Bimbo’s words, María’s coarse laugh came to me, a ghost made of sound. I wondered what would happen to the spaces that laugh was supposed to fill in the world, the ears it was meant to touch, the conversations it was supposed to decorate with its humor. I saw María climbing into the shitty Chevy Malibu she drove everywhere, Héctor Lavoe screaming nasally from those busted speakers, his voice leaking out the window like the perfect soundtrack to María’s perpetual smile.
When my pops died, when I was ten, I didn’t want to be home, because he haunted every corner of it. He’d hung every picture on our walls. The kitchen table smelled like his aftershave. He’d painted my room. He was everywhere, so I spent a lot of time at Bimbo’s place, and María had welcomed me then, fed me arroz con salchichas and asked me about my mom while scolding Bimbo that only assholes hit girls after he had pushed his sister.
