### Genres: Fantasy, Romantasy, Romance

### Premise:
Do not touch the sword. Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate.
In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn’t much a girl wouldn’t do for a glass of water.
Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen’s reservoirs for as long as she can remember.
But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone.
When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares...but it turns out they’re real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.
The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist’s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him... or her.
Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate. His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he’s the only way Saeris is going to make it home.

### Plot Summary:
Within Yvelia's magical realm, tensions between humans and Fae simmer under the oppressive rule of the vampire king, Malcolm. Saeris Fane, an unusual human with control over quicksilver, becomes central to the resistance effort against the vampire regime. Her connection to Fisher, a Fae warrior marked by personal sacrifice and trauma, evolves into a profound bond. This bond is visually symbolized by their matching tattoos, representing their intertwined fates. As the resistance prepares to confront Malcolm, they are embroiled in treacherous conspiracies, including Fisher's sister Everlayne's vampiric entanglement.
The narrative unfolds through a series of confrontations and revelations, with Fisher confronting his haunted past and the atrocity of the Gillethrye massacre, which his actions indirectly caused under manipulation. Saeris, Fisher, and Carrion Swift navigate a labyrinth of enemies and internal conflicts, retrieving a mystical coin pivotal to undermining Malcolm's undead forces. Saeris unleashes its power, summoning spiritual winds to dismantle Malcolm's army, but suffers life-threatening wounds.
On the verge of death, Fisher offers to save Saeris using his soul, but Taladaius presents her with a divine alternative. She meets the cosmic entities Bal, Mithin, and their father, Zareth, the God of Chaos, who reveals the truth of her bond with Fisher and its potential universe-altering impact. Saeris opts for life, severing her life thread through Zareth's power, and is thrust back into reality as a hybrid creature.
Awakening from a stasis in an opulent chamber, Saeris confronts her new identity and the intertwined nature of Fae and vampire heritages. Through Taladaius' guidance, she discovers the truth of her supernatural transformation during a battle against Malcolm’s forces. Amid these revelations, Carrion is unmasked as a Fae royal heir, his historical journey providing insight into Yvelia's magical heritage.
The segment introduces pivotal political shifts within the vampire hierarchy, as Saeris learns that by slaying Malcolm, she is expected to ascend as Sanasroth’s queen. Meanwhile, Fisher combats the quicksilver poison within him under the care of healers Te Léna and Iseabail, offering hope and stability against the existential threats looming over them. As they stand on the cusp of political upheaval, they must navigate intricate vampire and Fae dynamics, setting the stage for Saeris’s forthcoming coronation.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“Y’know, there’s really no need for all this violence.”
It was common knowledge in Zilvaren City that to lie to a guardian meant death. I knew this in a first-hand, painful way that most other Zilvarens did not. Almost a year ago to the day, I’d watched one of the queen’s men clad in beaten golden armor gut my neighbor for lying about his age. And before that, and far worse, I’d stood silently in the street while my mother’s throat had been split wide open, spilling jets of hot, peasant blood into the sunbaked sand.
As the handsome guardian’s hand closed around my neck now, his beautifully engraved gauntlet reflecting the glare of the twin suns overhead like a golden mirror, it was a miracle I didn’t crack open and yield my secrets like a piece of overripe fruit. His metal-tipped fingers gouged deeper into the hollow of my throat. “Name. Age. Ward. Spit it out. Low-tier citizens aren’t permitted in the Hub,” he snarled.
Like most cities, Zilvaren, the Great and Shining Banner of the North, was fashioned after the shape of a wheel. Around the city's outer limits, the different spokes—walls designed to keep people contained in their wards—towered fifty meters high above the shanti towns and overflowing sewers.
The guardian gave me an impatient shake. “Answer quick, girl, or I’ll have you dispatched through the fifth gate of hell directly.”
I groped loosely at his gauntlet, nowhere near strong enough to break his grip, and smirked, rolling my eyes up toward the bone-white sky. “How am I s’posed to tell you…anything if I…can’t…fucking…breathe?”
The guardian’s dark eyes simmered with rage. If anything, the pressure he applied to my windpipe intensified. “You have any idea how hot it is down in the palace cells during reckoning, thief? No water? No clean air? The reek of rotting corpses is enough to make the high executioner vomit. You’ll be dead within three hours, mark my words.”
The palace cells were a sobering thought. I’d been caught stealing once before and had been sent down there for a grand total of eight minutes. Eight minutes had been enough. During reckoning, when the suns, Balea and Min, were at their closest and the afternoon air shivered with heat, being trapped below ground in the festering sore that passed as a prison beneath the immortal queen’s palace would not be fun. And besides, I was badly needed above ground. If I didn’t make it back to the forge before dusk, the deal I’d spent hours brokering last night would fall through. No deal meant no water. No water meant the people I cared about would suffer.
