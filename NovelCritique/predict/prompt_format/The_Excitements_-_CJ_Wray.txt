### Title: The Excitements

### Genres: Historical Fiction, Mystery, Historical

### Premise:
A drama about two elderly female World War II veterans with a secret past who embark on one last adventure to right some historic wrongs.
Meet the Williamson sisters, Britain’s most beloved World War II veterans. Now in their late nineties, Josephine and Penny are in huge demand, beloved of journalists and producers, popping up on red carpets and at fundraisers and festivals all over the country. Despite their age, they’re still in great form—perfectly put together, sprightly and sparky, and always in search of their next “excitement.”
This time it’s a trip to Paris to receive the Légion d’Honneur for their part in liberating France. As always, they will be accompanied by their devoted gay nephew, Archie, who moved in with his aunts right after he came out. The press has always reported that these lady heroes worked for the Royal Navy and the nursing corps, but that’s their official cover. In reality, Josephine was an intelligence operative who drew maps used for the D-Day invasion while Penny was a spy and specialist at hand-to-combat, risking her teenage life in France. And this trip to Paris is not what it seems either. Scandal and crime have always quietly trailed the Williamson sisters, even in the decades after the war.
Now armed with new information about an old adversary, these much decorated (but admittedly ancient) veterans intend to settle scores, avenge lost friends, and pull off one last, daring heist before the curtain finally comes down on their illustrious careers.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
London, Spring 2022
John Betjeman was right. Nothing bad could ever happen at Peter Jones. Thus thought Archie Williamson as he sipped his cappuccino and looked out over London’s rooftops from the Sloane Square department store’s sixth floor café. The café was Archie’s happy place. Even on a grey day the atmosphere was sunny as people took turns at the window tables, understanding that one did not linger for hours over a single latte in front of this fabulous view. Archie nodded with satisfaction as a young woman with a laptop ceded her place to a frazzled mother with two small children, saving him from having to do the same.
With his own lunch companions still en route, Archie shook out the copy of the previous evening’s Standard left behind by his table’s last occupant and turned to the puzzle pages. Codeword was his favourite. He was getting faster each time, though it would be a while before he was able to crack the puzzle as quickly as his great-aunt Penny could.
As he pondered whether the number twenty-four represented an “a” or an “o,” Archie’s phone buzzed with a message. It was Arlene, Penny’s housekeeper, letting him know that she’d put Penny and her older sister Josephine into a taxi which should reach Sloane Square at any moment. Archie thanked Arlene for letting him know. She really was a treasure. But after forty minutes more there was still no sign of Archie’s beloved great-aunts. Then, just as he was about to call Arlene and ask her to check the taxi’s progress on her app, a managerial-type with a Peter Jones partner’s badge came flying up the escalator, calling out as she went, “Mr. Archie Williamson? Is there a Mr. Archie Williamson in the café?”
“Right here,” said Archie, standing up and giving her a wave. Two customers seated on the first inner row of tables stood up at the same time, ready to take Archie’s place by the window the very second it was vacated. They eyed each other like Olympic athletes at the start of the hundred metres and would move just as quickly the moment Archie stepped out of the way.
“Thank goodness,” said the woman, whose name, according to her badge, was Erica. “It’s your great-aunts. The Misses Williamson? I need you to come with me.”
Archie was immediately worried. “Are they OK? Are they hurt?”
There had been an incident the previous month when Josephine slipped on a discarded burger outside McDonald’s on the King’s Road and took Penny down with her as she fell. They’d both had to spend the night in the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital with suspected concussion.
“No, no,” said Erica. “They’re both fine. At least physically they are.” She dropped her voice. “It’s something else. Something . . . Mr. Williamson, I think it might be easier to discuss this somewhere private. Would you mind?”
