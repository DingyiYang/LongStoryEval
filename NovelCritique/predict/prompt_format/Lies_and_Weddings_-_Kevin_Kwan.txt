### Genres: Romance, Contemporary, Chick Lit

### Premise:
Rufus Leung Gresham, future Earl of Greshambury and son of a former Hong Kong supermodel, has a problem: his family fortune, the legendary Gresham Trust, has been depleted by decades of profligate spending. While magazine covers and Instagram stories display impeccably designed manors and shiny new yachts, the secret reality holds nothing more than a gargantuan mountain of debt. The only solution, put forth by Rufus’s scheming mother, is for Rufus to seduce a woman with money, thereby securing the family's precarious financial future.
Should he marry Solène de Courcy, a French hotel heiress with honey-blond tresses and a royal bloodline? Should he pursue Martha Dung, the tattooed venture capital genius who passes out billions like lollipops? Or should he follow his heart, betray his family, squander his legacy, and finally confess his love to the literal girl next door, the humble daughter of a doctor, Eden Tong? 
When the Gresham family descends on the Big Island of Hawaii to host a veritable who's who of sultans, barons, and oligarchs for the wedding of the decade, Rufus must merely flex his famous abs to bewitch the heiress of his choice. But instead a hot mic exposes a secret tryst, a volcanic eruption burns through the nuptials, and the Gresham family's plans—and their reputation—go up in flames.
Can the once-great earldom rise from the ashes? Or will a secret tragedy, hidden for two decades, reveal a shocking twist? Spanning the black sand beaches of Hawaii, the red city of Marrakech, the Los Angeles bachelor pad of a billionaire playboy, and the inner sanctum of England’s oldest family estate, 
Lies and Weddings reveals an enthralling family saga that is as scandalous and satirical as it is full of heart.

### Plot Summary:
The Greshams face a financial crisis exacerbated by natural disasters impacting their Hawaiian resort. Arabella, the family’s shrewd matriarch, schemes for advantageous marriages to secure their future. Rufus, caught between his family duties and love for Eden Tong, a principled doctor, remains resolute. Their relationship strengthens during a transformative road trip before family crises call them home.
At Greshamsbury Hall, Rufus resists pressure to marry Martha Dung, a wealthy heiress, instead staying loyal to Eden. Family tensions heighten as Bea announces her pregnancy with Gopal Das, destabilizing the family further. Rufus confronts provocations from Luis Felipe Tan, whose extravagant lifestyle is crumbling due to his limited inheritance following his father's death.
Luis Felipe, using the Greshams' estate debts as leverage, struggles with his past. Eden uncovers his pain, declining his marriage proposal aimed at avenging the Greshams. Despite Arabella’s manipulations wielded through Eden's hidden lineage, Eden maintains her integrity, supported by Rufus. Thomas Tong agonizingly decides to remove Luis Felipe from life support following an overdose.
Thomas abruptly departs to resolve another crisis: revealing to Eden her true lineage. In Venice, he discloses that her biological father, Henry Tong, passed away tragically, and her mother faked her death to shield Eden from Hong Kong’s societal shame. Thomas adopted Eden, ensuring a stable upbringing. Eden reconciles her identity, strengthened by her bond with Thomas.
Upon Thomas's arrival in Venice, he reveals Eden as the chief beneficiary of Rene Tan's trust, thrusting her into control of his staggering business empire. Despite her shock, Eden is determined to act with empathy and responsibility, particularly toward the indebted Greshams, allowing them to keep their estate.
During a sound bath session involving breathwork with the Gresham siblings, Eden gains clarity and relief from recent stress. Her decision to support the Greshams is warmly received. At Bea and Gopal’s wedding in Venice, Eden, surprised by her familial connections, faces her new role with humility. Arabella finally supports Eden and Rufus, seemingly accepting their relationship while eagerly planning their future.
In a pivot toward their future, Rufus and Eden decide to jointly explore a new life in Hawaii, marked by creativity and humanitarian pursuits. The narrative closes with their spontaneous departure from the Venetian wedding, eager to escape Arabella’s influences and forge their path together.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Augusta saw the text come in from her brother, but she chose to ignore it. She had other problems to deal with that were of far more importance to her, and at present she and Gopal Das were strolling through the exquisite grounds of the Bellaloha Resort, where every blade of grass had been perfectly positioned as if god had intended it, although it was really the work of Augusta’s mother, Lady Arabella, and her very expensive team of Belgian landscape designers. Augusta (Willcocks/Cheltenham/UWC Atlantic/Bard) headed toward the cliffside promontory where an elaborate Balinese pavilion had been erected and gestured halfheartedly to her spiritual advisor. “This is where we’re supposed to do the vows.”
“It’s beautiful,” Gopal Das said, smiling serenely at his beautiful British-Chinese acolyte.
“You think so?”
“Absolutely. Just look at these beams, and the love that was put into carving them.”
They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset. I’ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at a moment like this.”
Augusta cocked her head. “That sounds so familiar. Is that Pema Chödrön?”
“Er…no.”
“Oh, I know, it’s a quote from Ram Dass.”
“Could’ve been him,” Gopal Das said vaguely.[*] “Tell me, Augie, how do you feel, standing here in this sacred space, where in just four days you and Maxxie will be exchanging your vows?”
A cloud came over Augie’s face. “It doesn’t feel sacred to me at all.”
“It doesn’t?”
“Mummy designed every square meter of this resort. It’s the new jewel in her hotel empire that she’s waiting to show off to the world, and she’s turning my soul union with Maxxie into a coronation for herself. This entire resort makes me feel very…ungrounded.”
“Well then, let’s ground you.” The guru led his acolyte down the steps of the pavilion onto the dewy grass, and they sat facing each other in lotus position.
Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”
“Sadness,” Augie admitted.
“Good. Sadness cannot hurt you. Let us not judge this sadness, but rather, think of it as a ball, a white ball floating just in front of you. Tell me what you see in the ball.”
