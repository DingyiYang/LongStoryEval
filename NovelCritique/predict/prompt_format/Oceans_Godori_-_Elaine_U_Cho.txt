### Title: Ocean's Godori

### Genres: Science Fiction, Romance, Queer

### Premise:
Ocean Yoon has never felt like much of a Korean, even if she is descended from a long line of haenyeo, Jeju Island's beloved female divers. She's also persona non grata at the Alliance, Korea's solar system-dominating space agency, since a mission went awry and she earned a reputation for being a little too quick with her gun.
When her best friend, Teo, second son of the Anand Tech empire, is framed for murdering his family, Ocean and her misfit crewmates are pushed to the forefront of a high-stakes ideological conflict. But dodging bullets and winning space chases may be the easiest part of what comes next.
An adventure across the solar that delivers hyperkinetic action sequences and irresistible will-they-won't-they romance alongside its nuanced exploration of colonialism and capitalism, Ocean's Godori ultimately asks: What do we owe our past? How do we navigate our present while honoring the complicated facets of our identity? What can our future hold?

### Plot Summary:
Aboard the Pandia, a narrative of corporate betrayal, personal loss, and self-discovery unfolds, linking characters to an intricate web of interconnected pasts and unforeseen futures. Teophilus (Teo) Anand—the heir to Anand Tech—grapples with a legacy marked by corporate and familial obligations, haunted by the orchestrated murder of his family by Corvus. The story unfolds further when Corvus, along with his accomplice Amell, confronts Teo’s crew through a vidlink, escalating tensions. Ocean Yoon, an ex-pilot, confirms her connection to the Ohneul, destroyed by Corvus. Intervening to shield Teo, tensions rise between Phoenix and Corvus, hinting at a deeper personal history.
Phoenix, a seasoned space raider, is central to this drama, functioning as an intermediary amid various conflicting motives. With the past intertwined with Teo's, Phoenix balances admiration and guilt over Mercury’s exploitation, and this bond is tested during the crew’s negotiation with Corvus. The confrontation punctuates existing tensions between Phoenix and Corvus, indicating vulnerability and past choices.
As their opponent looms, a surprise attack disables Corvus’s ship momentarily, allowing the Pandia's crew to strategize an escape. The collective efforts highlight Ocean’s skillful piloting amidst heightened danger; her expertise shines as she navigates rigorous defensive maneuvers. Simultaneously, Cass and Gemini work in tandem, firing on and tracking Corvus’s ship while coordinating with the rest of the crew to secure safe passage.
The narrative propels them toward the Moon, Teo demonstrating his diplomatic acumen by persuading the Seonbi for sanctuary by invoking a tragic history of their shared past. The Seonbi initially reject their plea; however, Teo’s poignant argument regarding their plight prompts a momentous shift. Meanwhile, Ocean showcases exceptional piloting, exploiting every aeronautical advantage to maintain their course against an overwhelming threat.
As they breach Seonbi defenses, the Pandia nearly succumbs to Corvus’s relentless attack. Risking a dangerous landing with impaired systems, Ocean successfully negotiates the tight constraints of an emergency entry—demonstrating her prowess, culminating in a dramatic touchdown within Hangar B, thanks largely to Maggie’s timely technical support.
This segment fortifies the Pandia crew's resilience and solidarity, even amidst external chaos and personal grievances. Ocean emerges pivotal, transforming her haunted history into resolute determination. Her dexterity balances precise skill with impassioned resolve. Teo steps forward, revealing depth beyond familial ties, articulating alliances and inspiring trust among his newfound family. Similarly, Phoenix’s adept navigation of technological calamity mirrors reconciliation within himself. Corvus persists as an omnipresent antagonist, challenging both past affections and future trajectories.
Thus, anchored by committed synergy and interwoven sagas, the narrative courses through chaotic cosmic tides, poised at the crux of their collective engagement against an engulfing vendetta.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
HADRIAN SITS at the bar, gagging down a drink he hates.
The screen overhead plays a popular Icelandic holo-soap whose characters seem to peel off clothing at every available opportunity. A customer yells for a freeze-frame, and the people lined up on barstools hoot as the bartender angles the scene so they can ogle the actress on-screen.
Hadrian idly envisions smashing their mouths in. First the gaping boy sitting at the end of the counter, drool practically dribbling from his mouth, all the way down the line to the man waving his football scarf in time with an anthem sounding from another screen. Hadrian shivers at the thought of their teeth cutting his fists, blood dripping, pain flaring in their eyes. He composes himself so the thoughts stay submerged, but like a crocodile, they’re lurking in wait.
“Councilman Einarson?”
Hadrian turns toward the hand on his shoulder and shapes his mouth into a lopsided smile, feeling the pinch of the dimple on his right cheek that tells him he’s done it correctly. The spindly man behind him is of the uncomfortable type, as if he never adjusted to the growth spurt of his limbs shooting out like Alice’s after fisting her prescriptions. He squints at Hadrian, who keeps from tensing under the scrutiny. The man unwinds his scarf, shrugging off his coat as he takes in the bar.
“Unusual meeting place, isn’t it?”
“One of my favorite haunts, Councilman Rawls.”
Hadrian scratches at the thick beard at his neck in an idle gesture Einarson does as a nervous tic. Rawls frowns.
“Why have you called me here, Einarson?” he asks. “To gloat? The ecological referendum is as good as passed. You’ve won.” He raises his hand to order.
“Perhaps.” Hadrian keeps his voice low, affecting the slight accent he has been practicing for the last week. He’s counting on the noise of the bar to cover up any weaknesses in his performance. “But let’s not talk shop while we’re here, yes?”
Rawls pauses in his futile efforts to nab the bartender’s attention. He squinches his eyes at Hadrian again. Rawls is the perfect target. He has never been close with Einarson. They’re technically political enemies, but Rawls has never been popular with anyone. He’s a weaselly politician who doesn’t get asked out to drinks much—or at all really.
“Bartender!” Hadrian raps his knuckles on the wood grain of the bar, and the bartender finally comes over. “Your usual is an old-fashioned, isn’t it, Rawls? An old-fashioned for my friend here.”
Hadrian registers Rawls’s pleased flush in the gloomy bar. He’s taken the first step in easing his suspicion. Alcohol will take care of the rest. It’s not difficult to keep the conversation going, and Hadrian asks the bartender repeatedly for refills. He excuses himself once for the restroom, tripping into a nearby table in a drunken caricature. For good measure, he knocks over several drinks as he straightens, drawing jeers.
