### Title: The Longest Autumn

### Genres: Fantasy, Romance, Adult

### Premise:
Tirne is one of four humans rigorously selected to usher the turn of the seasons into the mortal world. Every year, she escorts the taciturn god Autumn between the godly and human realms. Autumn’s seasonal stay among mortals brings cooler weather, changing leaves, and the harvest of apples and gourds until Winter takes his place.
This year, the enchanted Mirror that separates their worlds shatters after Tirne and Autumn pass through, trapping both of them in the human realm. As the endless autumn stretches on, crops begin to fail and the threat of starvation looms. Away from the magic of the gods’ home, Tirne’s debilitating headaches return with a vengeance. Worse, Autumn’s extended stay in the human realm turns him ever more mortal and vulnerable, stirring a new, forbidden attraction to Tirne.
While the priesthood scrambles to find a way to reassemble the Mirror, Tirne digs into the temple’s secrets and finds an unlikely ally—or enemy—in the enigmatic sorcerer and master of poisons, Sidriel. Thrown into a world of mystery, betrayal, and espionage as she searches for the truth, might Tirne lose her morals, her hard-earned position, and the illicit spark between her and Autumn?

### Plot Summary:
The story is set in a realm where divine forces shape the lives of mortals through seasonal rituals, governed by the Mirror of a divine hierarchy. Tirne, the protagonist and former Herald of Autumn, is cast into turmoil as she navigates the spiritual and political conflicts within her community. Initially mired in divine responsibility, Tirne is removed from her role amidst intrigues and finds herself accused of a crime she didn't commit. As she battles external accusations and internal doubts, Tirne's journey is compounded by her ties with Sidriel, a sorcerer whose motivations intertwine with her fate, and Autumn, her divine patron whose once distant demeanor becomes intimately familiar.
Tirne's escape from the Temple exposes her to different beliefs through her Aunt Ilna, which challenges her understanding of divinity and mortality. With Ilna's death, Tirne is propelled into deeper conflict with the Temple's machinations. Betrayed by Bix, a former ally and hidden deity Kild, she grapples with complex alliances and escapes assassination during a ritual meant to mend the shattered Mirror. The ritual results in her divine blood being severed, freeing her from Autumn's grasp but leaving her to confront unresolved feelings and pursuit of identity.
Over time, Tirne undergoes healing and self-discovery, aided by Jaed, an emotional anchor amidst fractured trust. As the seasons change, the narrative explores her confrontations with Sidriel and Autumn, culminating in a bittersweet farewell as Vanyse takes on her former role as Herald. Though separated from Autumn's tangible influence, Tirne finds strength in friendships with Jaed, Feryn, and Vanyse, accepting their support and shared experiences.
In the restored cycle of seasons, Tirne faces Sidriel to finally close a painful chapter of unfulfilled affections and promises. Through these encounters, she realizes the multiplicity of love's hold on her heart, acknowledging connections that persist despite change and distance. As Autumn chooses Feryn as his Consort, Tirne embraces the stability her friendships provide and resolves to live independently of divine control. Her acceptance of the heart’s resilience and potential for rejuvenation signifies an enduring cycle of life and emotion beyond divine interference.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The souls of the dead burn in the night sky.
An eerie light hangs over the Temple courtyard, the blue and green and violet glow of souls bobbing overhead like enormous fireflies. Some wait patiently. Others flit around me in a nervous dance, uncertain. I lift a hand to brush a passing one, its pulse like a phantom cat rubbing against my fingertips. A human face flickers at its center, but the soul darts away before I can peer too closely.
“Soon,” I promise softly as I take another bite of my peach, sitting cross-legged with my back pressed against the Mirror. The fruit is small and overripe, cloyingly sweet. It’s the last of the summer harvest, though heat still lingers in the air, muggy and thick as soup. Tomorrow, after I’ve returned to the human realm for autumn, this will be an apple, the first fruit of my season. Our season.
An electric tingle sparks in my belly. Anticipation, yes, but also inevitable nervousness. One would think six years of escorting Autumn would make tomorrow’s ceremony routine, effortless. I don’t think I’ll ever banish the doubts entirely, the worry that I’m not truly fit for this duty, a mere fragile human mingling with the divine. But tomorrow I’ll prove once more that I earned this, that I’m worthy, that Autumn made the right choice when he selected me. My name will earn its place on the stone monument at the corner of this courtyard. Tirne of Autumn, inscribed just below the previous Herald’s name.
Even though it’s too far to see detail in the darkness, I know the names, dozens of them. I’ve read them so many times, picturing mine engraved beneath. The soft brown of the monument matches the rest of the courtyard, a wide circular space framed with walls of acorn-colored stone carved in swirls and sigils. Glossy ceramic tiles of creamy white rest beneath me. Broad arches at either end bear heavy gates, though I’ve never seen them closed. The Temple is open to all. And in the center of it all lies the Mirror, immense and red as a ruby.
Finishing the peach, I place the pit on the tray with sticky fingers, then wipe my hands with the damp cloth folded on the side. I already polished off the seed-flecked flatbread and crisp white wine. Offerings, payment to the woman who nightly ferries the dead from their realm. A nearby soul dips closer to my empty cup. Perhaps in its mortal life, this one enjoyed wine. My god assures me the dead do not truly remember their past lives, but they are nonetheless drawn to things they once loved.
Soft footsteps echo on the tile. Right on time. A familiar figure approaches through the archway. In the darkness, he almost looks like a phantom, with his bone-white skin and equally pale hair. Gifts from his mother, Winter. The souls flit away from him, though only I can see them.
