### Plot Summary:
Following Sorcerer Julian Solomon's murder and the prophecy hinting at treachery by a close confidant, young apprentice Tabatha Zeng dives into a world laden with magic and family secrets. As the heir chosen by Julian, she reluctantly becomes entangled in the Solomon family's tribulations, marked by sorcerous feuds and Detective Elena Chang's investigation focusing on Rowena Solomon. Tabatha, along with Julian’s son Callum, delves into the Solomon legacy, uncovering betrayals and the murders of prophetic sorcerers, including Hester O'Riley.
As family tensions rise and suspicions grow, Callum confesses to these murders to protect his mother, yet Tabatha doubts his culpability. Felix Solomon’s timely intervention against a supernatural threat sheds light on a deeper involvement, exonerating Callum, and adding layers to the familial intrigue unraveling at Solomon Manor. Felix takes the mantle of protector, employing kinetic magic while facing familial deception alongside Tabatha.
Circe Solomon, originally underestimated, reveals her desperate use of illusion magic in impersonating Callum to falsely implicate him and her unintentional creation of a deadly entity representative of her inner turmoil. Under the guise of the shadow creature, Circe's yearning for acceptance spirals into chaos. Confronted by her family and Tabatha, she ultimately comes to terms with her actions, dismantling the creature by giving up magic she had mimicked, an act of self-acceptance and responsibility for the chaos she inadvertently begot.
As the shadows settle, the Solomon family, marked by trials both sorcerous and familial, begins to navigate a path toward healing. Circe starts therapy, embarking on redemption, while Callum deals with familial betrayal and begins introspection on his role in his father's prophecy and his life. Through it all, Tabatha exemplifies resilience, learning to perceive the truths within prophecy magic beyond mere predictions.
In a contemplative close, Tabatha and Callum discuss destiny's malleability and the potential of living one's prophecy with agency. As they forge their path, the future remains an uncharted prophecy of choice, shaped by love, forgiveness, and the courage to face one's fears and faults, seeking redemption and understanding amid a legacy of magic and mystery.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The best prophecies always begin with love stories and end with tragedies. Or so it’s been said by fortune tellers and sorcerers. Do you think it’s true? I wonder. I used to think it was just a clever little cliché that Sorcerer Solomon leveraged to market his fortunes to an anxious audience, and I can’t fault him: Who doesn’t hope to play the hero of their own love story? Who doesn’t dread eventual tragedy? But lately, I’m beginning to believe that Sorcerer Solomon really lives by those words.
Lived. Sorry.
Please be patient. Toying with fate makes it hard to keep track of those hairline fractures between past, present, and future. When you spend all your time sneaking peeks at what’s yet to come, getting persnickety about the precise order of time seems pretty rich. But I must, for my own sake, try to keep this story as clear and conventionally chronological as I can. A story, properly told, can save a life. This one, if I tell it right, might even save mine.
My parents say that I spend an alarming amount of time thinking about death for someone only seventeen. Honestly, it’s a difficult subject to avoid in my line of work. It wasn’t so long ago that doing the sort of things I do after school would have gotten me burned at some stake or another. People claim that the twenty-first century has eroded the atmosphere, mysticism, and, frankly, sheer aesthetic that once elevated the practice of sorcery beyond the comprehension of mere plebes. I tell these people that if they want to hop into a time machine and get themselves murdered by history’s most notorious anti-fun police off in Puritan-ville, Salem, Massachusetts, they’re more than welcome. I’m not wild about murder, myself. Which is pretty ironic, when you consider the direction my life has taken recently.
But now I’m getting ahead of myself again. What did I tell you? Past, present, and future, all jumbled up in my head. So let’s begin at the real beginning: my pursuit of sorcery. Not just any class of sorcery, but fortune-telling. Even among sorcerers, bona fide fortune tellers are a rare breed. You have your illusionists—considered petty entertainers—and your kinetics—respectable, though a bit mainstream. But fortune tellers have always been kings among sorcerers. Why not? Hollywood might have use for another illusionist to temporarily beautify a face, and the military loves its kinetic soldiers, but if there’s one thing everyone everywhere wants, it’s the power to screw around with the future. And no one made the future their bitch half as well as Sorcerer Solomon could.
