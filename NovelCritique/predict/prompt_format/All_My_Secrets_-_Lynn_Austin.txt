### Title: All My Secrets

### Genres: Historical Fiction, Christian Fiction, Christian

### Premise:
New York, 1898. The only thing more shocking than Arthur Stanhope III’s unexpected death is the revelation that his will bestows his company―and most of the vast fortune that goes with it―to the nearest male heir, leaving his mother, wife, and daughter nearly impoverished. His widow, Sylvia, quickly realizes she must set aside her grief to ensure their daughter, Adelaide, is launched into society as soon as the appropriate mourning period passes. If Sylvia can find a wealthy husband for Addy before anyone realizes they’re practically destitute, there will be little disruption to the lifestyle they’re accustomed to.
Sylvia’s mother-in-law, Junietta, believes their life could use a little disruption. She has watched Sylvia play her role as a society wife, as Junietta once did, despite what it cost them both. Junietta vows to give her granddaughter the power to choose a path beyond what society expects.
But for Addy to have that chance, both mother and grandmother must first confront painful truths about their own choices. Only in bringing their secrets to light can they hope to reshape their family inheritance into a legacy more fulfilling than they ever dared dream.

At its core is Junietta Stanhope, the resilient matriarch who guides her family through historical shifts, focusing on themes of integrity and independence. The story unfolds in the opulent yet restrictive world of New York high society, where women grapple with emerging movements like women's suffrage.
Sylvia Stanhope, once preoccupied with sustaining her family's wealth through strategic marriages, undergoes a significant transformation following her husband A.B.'s death. As she explores personal fulfillment beyond societal expectations, Sylvia turns to creative endeavors, providing her with a newfound sense of purpose. Her journey evolves further as she prepares to lead the Stanhope Foundation, offering a path of dignity and service.
Adelaide Stanhope emerges as the story's protagonist, seeking personal autonomy in a world that pressures her to marry for financial security. Under the influence of her grandmother Junietta and observing the changes within her own family, Addy begins to reassess her values, yearning for a life beyond societal conventions. Her growing relationship with Howard Forsythe, the principled family lawyer connected to the Stanhopes, offers Addy an alternative view of life defined by genuine understanding and integrity rather than wealth.
Howard Forsythe plays an integral role as an ally and confidant, aiding Addy in uncovering family secrets and fostering her resolve to pursue her true desires. Their bond strengthens through the shared experience of searching for Junietta’s lost son, Andrew Browne, revealing hidden family layers and blocking more opportunities for emotional closure and growth.
Andrew Browne, Junietta’s long-lost son, enters the story as a symbol of reconciliation and resilience, enriching the family's narrative while fulfilling emotional voids. His integration into the Stanhope legacy embodies a testament to the family's enduring strength and unity.
The narrative crescendos in an emotional climax as Sylvia embraces the leadership of the Stanhope Foundation, stepping into a role that promises personal dignity and societal impact. Meanwhile, Adelaide utilizes her inheritance to chart an independent path, signifying a generational shift towards autonomy and self-determination amidst the changing society. The family mansion's impending sale reflects these significant transitions, moving towards a future rooted in purpose rather than opulence.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
NEW YORK CITY
JULY 1898
Adelaide Stanhope sat at her father’s graveside, as still and upright as the surrounding tombstones. The enormous Stanhope obelisk loomed over the family cemetery plot where her great-grandfather, grandfather, and now her father had been laid to rest. Grandmother Junietta Stanhope’s hand, gloved in black lace, lay limp and fragile in her own as the service droned on. Adelaide grasped so few of the clergyman’s words that they might well have been in another language—eternity ... dust ... life ... rest.
Father was dead.
He was dead, and everything in Adelaide’s tightly scripted, well-mannered world had been upended, tossed about, and left to flounder like a luxurious steamship, helpless in the grip of a storm.
The scent of roses and lilies, piled on her father’s coffin and heaped all around it, drifted to her on the breeze. The heady fragrance seemed misplaced. It usually accompanied one of Mother’s grand dinner parties or balls, filling their New York City mansion or summer home in Newport with their perfume. Adelaide closed her eyes, picturing Father in his tuxedo and starched white shirtfront, Mother reigning beside him in a dazzling gown and ropes of pearls as they greeted guests in their vast flower-filled foyer. It was a picture she had always taken for granted, imagining that nothing in her life would ever change. What would life be like now, without Father?
She opened her eyes again and glanced at her grandmother’s face, clouded by a veil of black netting. She sat stoically unbowed as if carved from wax, like the figures Adelaide had seen in Madame Tussaud’s museum in London last year. For a parent to lose a child at any age was a tragedy, but Father was Grandmother Junietta’s only child, her only son. For as far back as Adelaide could remember, her grandmother had seemed tireless, ageless, committed to the charitable foundation she presided over—a man’s job, really, but Grandmother seldom played by society’s rules. Adelaide had been close to her as a child, before growing into a young woman and taking her place in the privileged society life she now enjoyed.
