### Plot Summary:
The murder of Thom Calhoun unveils deep family secrets, setting off a series of investigations and personal reckonings. Detective Jacqui Washington's probe into Thom's death reveals tangled relationships characterized by manipulation and deceit. The family, which outwardly upheld an affluent public image, grapples with internal betrayals and hidden agendas.
Ellie Grace Calhoun, a social media influencer, struggles under the scrutiny of both her public persona and the ongoing investigation. Her husband, Zak (alias Darnell Hoover), is unmasked as a fraudster linked to crimes and a suspicious death in Arizona. This revelation incites suspicion about his potential involvement in Thom's murder. Attempting to manage familial tensions, Nate Calhoun unravels his father's affair, seeking to protect Malcolm, who is at the center of these familial disputes. Nate's partner, Danit, becomes crucial in unearthing evidence about Thom’s murder while advocating for transparency amidst chaos.
Tensions intensify as Nate uncovers Thom’s updated will, aiming to exclude Ginny, his manipulative wife, whom he sought to divorce. Ginny's efforts to cover up her potential complicity involve coercing Renée Price, a neighbor, into participating in a scheme to misdirect the murder investigation, further involving Zak. Together, they construct an elaborate ruse, implicating Shawna Douglas in Thom's murder as part of a staged robbery.
Confrontations among the Calhouns reach a crescendo when Danit presents evidence pointing to Ellie Grace as the shooter in Thom’s death. Ellie Grace admits to shooting her father, fueled by her fear of losing Zak and the life they were building together. Her confession leads to collective arrests, with Zak and Ginny also detained for their roles in orchestrating cover-ups and misleading investigators. 
Subsequently, discoveries about Malcolm's parentage surface when his true lineage—through Thom’s affair with Shawna—is revealed. Unbeknownst to his family, Trey Calhoun had initially believed he might be Malcolm’s father; however, the truth entangles him further as evidence of drug involvement indicts him in Shawna’s death. Trey’s realization about his father's manipulation points to Thom's capacity for wrangling family strings to maintain control.
Three months later, Nate and Danit embrace a new chapter, marrying in a peaceful island ceremony on Saipan. They cherish their freedom from the tumultuous family drama, marking a fresh start. Meanwhile, as Ginny serves her time in prison for misleading the investigation and obstruction, Ellie Grace, Zak, and Trey face looming trials in connection to the unfolding events.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Everybody loves the Calhouns.
They are such a lovely family. Thom and Ginny Calhoun have lived in the same house on Sycamore Lane for thirty-five years, and raised all three children in their classic white colonial with crisp black trim.
So what in the world are the police doing here?
The neighbors gather in small groups to gawk at the squad cars parked askew on the wide, tree-lined street. The sirens are off, but the cars’ flashing blue lights announce their presence.
What happened? The neighbors whisper to each other as an ambulance arrives. Was it Thom? His heart? The consensus is no—Thom, with his mane of thick silver hair, is in such good shape for a man in his midsixties. Maybe it’s Ginny, one woman says, but no one takes her seriously. Ginny of the wide smile, always in her tennis whites—she can run women half her age around the courts.
Must be one of the children. They were all here for the party this afternoon, sniffs one neighbor, who has never appreciated the noise and hubbub that the Calhouns’ annual cherry blossom party brings to their quiet street. It’s bad enough that the tourists descend on the Somerwood neighborhood every spring to photograph the explosion of white and pale pink blossoms. But the Calhoun party seems like such an ostentatious display of wealth.
Can’t be Nate, another neighbor says about the Calhouns’ middle child. Such a wonderful young man. A marine biologist, I believe. I hear he’s in from California for the party. Have you seen his little boy? Adorable.
I hear he’s engaged, and thank goodness. That little boy needs a mother!
I certainly hope Ellie Grace is not involved. She’s the whole reason I joined Instagram. I love seeing what she’s up to.
That leaves Trey.
It’s what they’re all thinking. The eldest Calhoun child was kicked out of two D.C.-area prep schools and military school. His father pulled some strings to get him into college. Everyone knows Thom made a DUI go away for Trey, as well. After two years of college, Trey dropped out and left for LA to work in the movie business. Things went south, and now he is back, living in the house next to his parents, a bungalow they had bought for guests.
Everyone’s pulling for Trey, though.
Despite his youthful mistakes, he has so much potential. And it’s been wonderful for Ginny to have her oldest son back; she really dotes on him. If anything happened with Trey, she would be devastated.
Ask Renée, someone says. She’ll know.
Despite their superficial differences, Renée Price and Ginny Calhoun have been close friends for years. The two are often seen walking their dogs—French bulldogs for Ginny and a bichon frise for Renée—early in the morning.
Renée is seated at a cocktail table in the Calhouns’ front yard. Hours ago, it might have been a party guest she was chatting with. Now, it’s a police detective questioning her.
