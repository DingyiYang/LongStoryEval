### Plot Summary:
At The Manor in Dorset, an annual solstice festival spirals into chaos, exposing the long-hidden secrets and scandals of Francesca Meadows and her family. Francesca, the manipulative owner of The Manor, fights desperately to keep control as her criminal past, including a murder she and her grandfather covered up, begins to surface. She becomes increasingly erratic and desperate as her carefully constructed facade crumbles under the weight of her sins and the ensuing chaos of the festival.
During the festival, a catastrophic fire consumes The Manor. Eddie, one of the employees, is hailed as a hero for saving guests but is haunted by his inability to save two people within Francesca's family. Eddie is driven by the discovery of his missing brother, Jake, who has returned home as DI Walker, a detective now embroiled in resolving cold cases. Jake admits to Eddie that he witnessed Francesca's crime years ago, further complicating their already fractured relationship. The brothers struggle with their past and try to find solace amidst the ongoing police investigations.
Francesca's husband, Owen, is pushed from being a supportive partner to seeking vengeance as he discovers the remains of his mother, Cora, buried at The Manor. His quest for justice tangles with Eddie's mission to uncover the dark legacy that Francesca has left behind. This collective pursuit of truth brings Eddie closer to understanding the terrifying legacy of deceit and betrayal that taints his family.
Bella emerges as a critical force in her quest for justice against Francesca's crimes, aiding in unraveling the family's sinister history. Her involvement sparks a series of revelations, further stirred by Jake's revelations, cementing her role as a catalyst in exposing the hidden truths.
Michelle stands out as a formidable contender against Francesca, drawing power from local folklore and historical injustices to challenge Francesca’s long-standing authority. Nathan Tate reveals his ties to the night’s chaos through drug influence, adding another layer to the multi-faceted community conflicts that arise.
In an ultimate act of desperation, Francesca attempts to escape by setting The Manor on fire, only to end her life on the cliffs after an eerie confrontation with Eddie, who’s in disguise as a Night Bird—an embodiment of local mystical lore and morality. Her demise encapsulates the collective climax of relationships and revelations, marking the tragic end of a profoundly flawed character.
Two months after the fire, Eddie inherits The Manor, opting not to sell but to transform it into a community center, honoring his mother’s legacy and initiating a path toward healing and reconciliation. His introspective period post-fire involves reconciling with his actions that indirectly led to Francesca’s tragic death, reflecting on personal growth amidst trauma.
The narrative concludes with Bella reflecting on her quest. Although she never received a confession from Francesca, she has unearthed a new purpose and sense of peace. She plans a meeting with Jake Walker to revisit the past with acceptance, framed against the backdrop of local whispers about his return, embodying the town's ongoing unease and transformation.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
JUNE 2025, OPENING NIGHT
IT’S OPENING NIGHT OF THE Manor, the “new jewel of the Dorset coastline.” The drama is all out front: soaring ocean views, emerald lawns stretching to the cliff edge, the Owen Dacre–designed infinity pool. But on this side, the landward side, there’s another world. A bristle of dense ancient forest behind the main building, which guests can access via a series of gravel paths that wind between the “Woodland Hutches.” One of these is mine.
I close the door. Follow the sound of music and laughter through the purple twilight to the welcome drinks, which are taking place on the very edge of the trees. I step into a chic take on a woodland grotto. Hundreds of lanterns hang from branches. An actual harpist plays. Antique rugs and huge scatter cushions have been strewn about the forest floor with bohemian abandon. I sit down on one, gulp back a “Woodland Spirit” cocktail—“a dash of locally harvested birch bitters and rosemary infused gin.”
My fellow guests loll around, chatty and giddy with the anticipation of a weekend in the sun beside the sea with nothing to do but eat, drink, swim, and make merry. Many of them seem to know one another: wandering about shrieking as they bump into old friends, some reclining on the rugs and calling to acquaintances to join them. The vibe is relaxed, albeit spiced with a faint note of social competition.
No one needs the ultra-soft woolen blankets provided because—though the sun is setting—it’s still warm enough to wear only a single layer of linen (there’s a lot of linen). The first flare of the impending heatwave.
In the middle of the scene, like a fairy queen—like Titania on her woodland throne—sits the owner of The Manor. Francesca Meadows. Radiant in a pale rose, off-shoulder fantasia of washed silk, hair rippling down her back, face aglow with candlelight. The culmination of a dream: that’s what she said in the article. I’m so excited to share this place with everyone. Well, everyone who can afford it, anyway. But who’s quibbling?
I look around me. I suppose it’s all pretty idyllic if you’re part of a couple or larger group, if you’ve come here for a weekend of escaping the city. Maybe it’s just me for whom it doesn’t feel quite so mellow and chummy.
I wait for the alcohol to hit, my gaze flitting toward the deepening shadows between the trees, to the ragged ceiling of branches uplit by the lanterns, down to my own outfit: linen, yes, but with the tell-tale creases that show it’s just been pulled from a packet. But the one place my eyes linger time and again—I can’t help it—is on the face of Francesca Meadows. She looks so zen. So very fucking content.
Suddenly there’s a commotion, deep in the wood. Her gaze snaps in that direction. The guests fall silent and peer into the gloom. The harpist stops playing.
