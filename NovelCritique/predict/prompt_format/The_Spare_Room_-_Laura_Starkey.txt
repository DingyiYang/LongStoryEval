### Genres: Romance, Contemporary, Chick Lit

### Premise:
Rosie had the perfect evening lined up: she'd come home early, slip into a sexy dress and surprise her boyfriend with date night. What she was not expecting was to find his bags packed and herself unceremoniously dumped.
But she can't even think about her heartbreak when she faces the more pressing matter of making rent this month. And in desperate times, she agrees to let her spare room out to her elusive upstairs neighbour.
Aled needs somewhere to stay while his place is being renovated, and she gets to keep her home. It's a win-win situation... At least in theory.
For Rosie has sworn off men indefinitely, and never saw herself living with one so soon after her breakup. But being in Aled's company day in, day out has this annoying habit of playing havoc with her heart...
On paper they're just flatmates, but could there be room for more between them?

### Plot Summary:
Rosie Butler navigates a transformative journey following her breakup with James, seeking autonomy and fulfillment. She moves into a flat with Aled Thomas, a gentle and introspective teacher. Together, they develop a close friendship while caring for a stray cat, Springsteen, which becomes a symbol of their bond. Working at Rhianne's deli, Rosie regains her confidence, inspiring colleague Tobi to pursue higher education.
Rosie's path is continually shaped by her mother Julie’s traditional expectations, contrasting sharply with her newfound independence. Meanwhile, Rosie develops feelings for Aled—fraught with lingering confusion due to his reserved demeanor and owing to interactions like their nearly-romantic moments and Aled’s quietly protective nature. Aled's firm stance against unhealthy family dynamics further strengthens his connection with Rosie, despite their relationship's unresolved status.
Amidst a tense reunion with James, who is now with Dylan, Rosie experiences clarity, decisively turning down James’s recycled proposal and embracing her independence. The tumultuous period is mitigated by the support of her friends at the deli, especially Rhianne. Rosie also confronts her friend Niamh about prioritizing others to her detriment, a pivotal moment which leads both to reassess their lives—Niamh opting for freelance work and Rosie choosing to apply for university.
Misunderstandings arise when Aled misconstrues Rosie’s dealings concerning James, leading to a withdrawal. With guidance from Rhianne, Rosie decides to travel to Wales to rectify things with Aled, supported by a now-supportive Niamh. As they drive through inclement weather, Rosie reflects on her growth and emotional journey. Upon reaching Wales, they walk through a storm to Aled’s guest house, where Rosie courageously avows her love for Aled, resolving past miscommunications, especially regarding a building sale she'd misunderstood.
In an emotional revelation, Aled confesses his love for Rosie, acknowledging it predates their shared experiences in London and that he paused plans on selling family property because of her. His family's good-natured reception and amused support frame this tender reconciliation. Rosie proposes a future together, to which Aled joyfully agrees, concluding with a heartfelt kiss amidst familial elation. The epilogue reveals Rosie thriving in London, with Aled and their cat, amid cherished routines and a reassuring understanding of home as a shared space defined by love rather than physical confines.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
As Rosie Butler dug around in her underwear drawer for a pair of stomach-squashing control knickers, she reminded herself that it wasn’t every day she was asked to attend a swanky eight-course dinner at a posh central London hotel.
If she was honest, she’d have preferred the invitation to have been delivered a little earlier and a lot more clearly – but she pushed this thought aside, suppressing the spark of annoyance she felt in the same way her very large, very tight pants would soon be compacting her tummy and backside.
It was the day of James’s work summer party – an annual event at which employees and their dates were invited to eat, drink and make merry. Her boyfriend of almost a decade had his eye on a major promotion, and he’d repeatedly stressed the need for the two of them to show up smiling and ready to schmooze.
Somehow, though, he’d left it until Rosie had showered and started smearing moisturiser on her cheeks to mention that the event would involve a formal sit-down dinner. The dress code, he had blithely explained, was super smart – without so much as a hint of casual.
Dismayed, Rosie had eyed the pretty cotton sundress and sandals she’d planned to wear, laid out neatly on their bed. It was the same outfit she’d shown him two days ago, and which he’d given an absent-minded thumbs up while typing something on his phone.
‘You’re telling me I need evening wear for this thing?’ she’d asked, panic-stricken. ‘A cocktail dress? Heels? And you’re mentioning this forty-seven minutes before we need to leave?’
James had merely shrugged. ‘It’s at a high-end hotel in Covent Garden. I thought it was obvious.’ The notion that Rosie – whose wardrobe largely consisted of well-worn jeans, favourite t-shirts and casual Chuck Taylors – might need time to put together a suitably elegant look had entirely passed him by.
Rosie had sat in silence as she applied blush, lipstick and mascara, valiantly resisting the urge to bring up the fact that last year’s summer party – a relaxed affair involving Pimm’s, chicken kebabs and posh burgers in brioche buns – had been held in the garden of the very same hotel they were going to tonight.
Aware that she had to be in a cab in approximately fifteen minutes, Rosie stood in her fluffy pink dressing gown and riffled through her wardrobe. She watched James shrug into the custom-made suit his parents had bought him for his brother’s recent wedding, and sighed heavily. It wasn’t fair; dressing up for a posh evening do was so much easier for a man.
