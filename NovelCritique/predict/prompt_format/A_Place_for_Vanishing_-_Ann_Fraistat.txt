But Libby’s new home turns out to be anything but normal. Scores of bugs haunt its winding halls, towering stained-glass windows feature strange, insectile designs, and the garden teems with impossibly blue roses. And then there are the rumors. The locals, including the mysterious boy next door, tell stories about disappearances tied to the house, stretching back over a century to its first owners. Owners who supposedly hosted legendary masked séances on its grounds.

### Plot Summary:
Libby and her family find themselves lured into the enigmatic and foreboding world of a mansion known as the House of Masks—a place entangled with mysterious disappearances, including Libby's grandparents. Initially unrecognized by her skeptical mother, Sharon, Libby perceives supernatural forces at work, triggered by masks that possess wearers, transforming them into monstrous iterations of themselves. As strange happenings intensify, Libby and her neighbor Flynn—a medium with ties to the mansion—form a strong connection. Together, they conduct a séance that awakens malevolent powers, affecting Libby's sister Vivi, who becomes ensnared in the Butterfly mask, while their mother is influenced by the spirit, Rose.
The narrative builds as Libby takes a determined stance to save her family, harnessing the power within the Beetle mask to confront the horrors around them. Realizing a need for Flynn's medium abilities, they plan an escape, braving the hedge maze that shrouds the mansion. It is during this perilous venture that they discover a crypt—a hideaway holding masks that signify the impris0onment of their family members and Flynn's father, John. Here, John's ghost provides crucial insights into Ellen Clery's history with the house: a tale of summoning spirits named the Fallen Stars through a crystal ball and the intention to control them with masks. He reveals that only by conducting a risky séance can Libby and Flynn thwart the march towards the catastrophic Rite of the Stars, which involves thirteen souls unless halted.
In a climactic séance, Libby and Flynn face Ellen’s ghost; with unveiled resolve, they arrest her spiritual strife and rest her spirit, escape the crypt's clutches, and confront the spirits seeking their dark ritual at the séance table. Libby regains control long enough to attempt the destruction of the crystal ball, a contest mirrored against the spirits’ push to complete the Rite. With Vivi's aid, they shatter the ball, liberating themselves and putting spirits to rest.
Following the supernatural climax, Flynn is left gravely wounded, and as Libby clutches him amid falling spectral remnants, sirens signify their salvation. The epilogue reveals the family, determined to rebuild their lives within the house, choosing to defy fear and spurning relocation. Libby faces the new school year with nervous resolve, buoyed by Flynn's companionship. Despite enduring visible setbacks from their summer ordeal, they resolve to live with renewed purpose.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
DAYS LIKE THIS MADE ME WISH I’d never come back from the dead.
Since the doctors dragged me back six weeks ago, life sometimes felt foggy, like a strange dream. But nothing was stranger than this: sitting in Mom’s road-weary sedan, gaping through my window at the house towering over the yard, the street, our car. Us.
The house stared back.
The crumbling Queen Anne Victorian was massive. Solid. It sank into the earth like it had roots coiled five hundred feet down.
“Do you like it, girls?” Mom turned to me in the passenger seat and my thirteen-year-old sister in the back. Since I’d returned from the psych ward, her every word came glazed in honey. The way you might talk to a five-year-old—if you were bad with kids.
I couldn’t find the breath to answer her. I rolled down the window, that thin veneer between me and the house, inch by inch. The summer air climbed into the car with us, sticky and suffocating.
This was the house Mom had inherited from her parents? The one that Mom—a real estate agent—had ignored for decades? Had never even tried to sell?
I was stunned by the sheer size. The extravagance. The house had to be over a century old, with its spindly spires and lacy woodwork. In places, the white trim was still so shiny and marshmallowy that it hurt my teeth. But age and rot had left their marks, too. Faded cobalt paint encased the house’s shingled body, peeling like sunburned skin. Weathered wood boarded every window. It was like the place was guarding against a hurricane decades in the making.
And it was like the neighbors knew. Football-field-sized gaps sat between our property and the single-family ranch homes on either side. They hunkered low, less than half the height of our monstrosity.
The longer I stared, the more my chest tightened under my seat belt. The house’s steep rooflines towered with octagonal turrets and sharply gabled dormers, masking the layout inside. It felt like the kind of puzzle that if you stared long enough, revealed a whole new picture. One hiding smugly just under the surface. There had to be some reason it had sat empty so long. Maybe the neighbors and their flinching houses knew something I didn’t.
Worse, maybe Mom knew something I didn’t. All this time, she’d been holing us up in a two-bedroom apartment a couple counties over, and she’d made this place sound like some rinky-dink shack.
“Mom…,” I said finally, “I thought you said this house was worthless.”
“No!” Mom hid her hands in her lap, tearing at her thumb’s cuticle. A habit I’d inherited, but she’d tried to kick, to set an example. “It wasn’t the best fit for us before, but I couldn’t have said ‘worthless.’ ”
