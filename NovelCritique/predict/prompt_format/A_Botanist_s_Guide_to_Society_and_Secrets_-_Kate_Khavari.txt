### Plot Summary:
Saffron Everleigh, a sharp-minded botanist in 1920s London, finds herself embroiled in a deadly investigation involving murder and espionage. Her journey began with the mysterious poisoning of Demian Petrov, which led her deeper into a web of intrigue following Jeffery Wells' death at the Harpenden Phytopathological Service. Supported by her clever flatmate, Elizabeth Hale, she navigates both personal and societal challenges while unraveling complex conspiracies.
Saffron's investigation reveals political radicals threatening government stability by exploiting scientific discoveries. Simultaneously, she contends with Nick Hale, Elizabeth's elusive brother, whose espionage ties test her principles. Her relationship with colleague Alexander Ashton provides solace and support as they delve into the case, sharing personal traumas and bolstering each other amid chaos.
Their investigation uncovers documentation about a dangerous fungus, intensifying their covert operations at the Path Lab. Assisted by Sergeant Simpson, they face threats from Alfie Tennison, who manipulates Elizabeth’s former lover, Colin Smith, to pressure Saffron into revealing crucial files. Through cunning and bravery, they gather evidence involving the conspiracy, although it implicates Elizabeth and Alexander in risking their own safety.
Elizabeth's bold confrontation at the lab exposes Mary's accidental poisoning of Petrov, further entangling Saffron in danger. She smarter evades Colin’s threats with Sergeant Simpson’s unexpected help and secures essential evidence. The reprieve after police arrest Colin is short-lived, as a man named Bill reveals his deeper and more sinister network, threatening Saffron for withholding destroyed materials crucial to his plans.
Amidst these trials, Saffron and Alexander's relationship flourishes emotionally, providing a refuge against external threats. Nevertheless, this idyll is disrupted when Bill Wyatt emerges as a pivotal antagonist, embroiling Saffron in a larger espionage threat, thus deepening the narrative complexity.
Eventually, Saffron agrees to visit Nick’s Westminster office, suspecting further espionage involvement. She confronts Dr. Sutcliffe, who owns up to destroying dangerous fungus samples from a case central to her investigation, voicing concerns over environmental risk. His confession, though controversial, resonates with Saffron, reflecting her own internal conflict about destruction for greater safety.
In the story's epilogue, a more personal upheaval arrives. Saffron, now in a budding romantic relationship with Alexander, receives distressing news involving her family. Mr. Feyzi informs her of her grandfather’s heart attack, hinting at another looming mystery as her family requested Dr. Wyatt’s services—a figure ominously linked to past investigations. Berlin throws her family into new peril, putting Saffron on high alert. Determined to shield her family, she plans a visit with Alexander and Elizabeth, resolute in facing the surprises and adversaries lying in wait.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Cold rain soaking her boots, splashing her stockings, and leaking from the brim of her ruined hat and onto her face was the least of Saffron Everleigh’s worries.
No, it was the lingering nausea of the crossing, clinging to her like a zealous strand of Galium aparine, combined with the exhaustion of traveling for over twenty hours, that made her miserable and desperate for the quiet comfort of her flat.
Thanks to the freezing downpour making the November night dreary, there were no cabs available as Saffron emerged on wobbly legs from the train station. She’d resorted to the bus, which had been a poor choice, given her uncertain stomach and London bus drivers’ general propensity for driving like hellhounds were at their heels. Rather than risking vomiting all over the passengers of the cramped bus, she’d alighted three blocks before her stop and had to complete the walk with neither an umbrella nor an adequate raincoat.
Given the late hour, her quiet Chelsea street was dark, save for one flat. The warm lights emanating from the top floor of her building drew her like a bee to bee balm, promising a hot cuppa, a bath, and home.
She trudged up the stairs, her numb fingers fumbling with the pins of her hat. At the top, she eagerly pounded on the door. It swung open, and the anticipatory smile on Saffron’s lips died.
Standing at the door to her flat was a stranger. He was youngish, tall, gangly, and wore wire-rimmed glasses and a look of haughty indifference. “Yes?”
Saffron blinked, checked the number on the plate next to the door, then looked back at the stranger. He had glossy blond hair in a washed-out shade of flax and very pale skin, which made the redness around his mouth and neck more apparent. His tie was loosened, she saw as she followed the color to his neck and then to his haphazardly buttoned waistcoat. At a loss, she asked, “Er—who are you?”
He lifted a brow. “Pardon me. Who are you?”
“Who’s at the door, darling?” asked a voice from within the flat.
Saffron made to look around the man, but he moved with her to block her view. She glared at him and called down the hall, “Elizabeth?”
The man bristled, propping his hands on his hips and doing his best to loom over her. “Now, see here—”
Behind him, Elizabeth Hale popped around the corner at the end of the hall. “Why, hullo! You’re back! Don’t just stand there. Colin darling, move aside so she can come in!” She disappeared around the corner.
The haughty man—Colin, apparently—grudgingly retreated to the parlor without a word. Saffron stepped inside and negotiated removing her woefully soaked coat just inside the door. She could hear Colin saying something and Elizabeth’s husky alto replying.
