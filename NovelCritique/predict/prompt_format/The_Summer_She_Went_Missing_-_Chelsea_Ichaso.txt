### Title: The Summer She Went Missing

### Genres: Mystery, Thriller, Young Adult

### Premise:
Last summer, they searched for Audrey Covington. This summer, they'll search for the truth. Paige Redmond has always felt lucky to spend her summers in Clearwater Ridge, with lazy days sunning at the waterfalls and nights partying at the sprawling houses of the rich families who vacation there. The Covingtons are one of these families, and beautiful, brilliant Audrey Covington is Paige's best friend. And last year, when Audrey's crush-worthy brother Dylan finally started noticing Paige, she was sure it would be the best summer ever. Except Audrey didn't seem quite like herself. Then one night, she didn't come home. Though Audrey wasn't the first girl to disappear in Clearwater Ridge, she left behind more lies than clues. Now, one summer later, her case has gone cold, and nobody, least of all Paige, can make sense of what happened. When Paige stumbles across a secret hidden in Audrey's room, however, it changes everything she thought she knew about last summer. She and Dylan set out on their own investigation, discovering things even the police don't know about the people of Clearwater Ridge. But tracking down missing girls―girls who might be beyond saving by now―means entering a world far darker than Paige has ever imagined. And if she isn't careful, she'll become the next girl to vanish.

### Plot Summary:
Clearwater Ridge tells a captivating story centered around Paige, who investigates the mysterious disappearance of her friend Audrey in a town deeply embedded with deceit tied to its affluent residents. The narrative unfolds through dual timelines: the present where Paige and Dylan push past social barriers set by affluent villains like the Haywood brothers and Tripp Shaw, and flashbacks revealing Audrey’s arduous experience.
The story begins with Audrey, traumatized post-assault, becoming entangled with Oliver and Brent Haywood, whose sinister dealings mask under a facade of charm. Simultaneously, Paige, who is determined and intuitive, aligns her efforts with Dylan, uncovering deceit and unveiling stark divisions between privileged wrongdoers and helpless victims in Clearwater Ridge.
As Paige investigates, she discovers connections linking Audrey and missing girl Madison Blake to financial schemes masking an ugly reality of social manipulations and betrayal. Paige finds herself tracing footsteps back to the Haywood family, who epitomize a dichotomy of charm and violence.
Audrey’s captivity unfolds as she is trapped in an underground bunker by Oliver. Her deteriorating physical state contrasts with Paige's determined quest for truth, which leads her to the Haywood estate. Meanwhile, Oliver and Brent's calculated misdeeds unravel, revealing allegiance to each other and entangling themselves deeper into criminality.
Amid threats and deceit, Paige and Dylan’s persistence pays off as they confront an ethical puzzle, risking their safety. Paige's intrepid pursuit guides them to the revelation of Audrey’s plight, initiating a daring rescue. In a climactic twist, Madison Blake, once thought a victim, intervenes using decisive force to save everyone from the hands of the Haywoods, resulting in Brent's immediate demise.
The final scenes highlight a poignant moment of relief and reflection. The following summer finds Paige, Dylan, Audrey, and their friends in the serene landscape of Clearwater Ridge trying to return to some semblance of normalcy. Despite the haunting events, courage, friendship, and underlying bonds triumph. Audrey embarks on a healing journey, supported by friends in reconnecting and rebuilding her life while looking forward to college. Simultaneously, the narrative acknowledges the fallen, including Madison, who, despite her past crimes, is seen as a hero for her brave intervention.
Ultimately, Clearwater Ridge explores the tension between privilege and justice, the resilience of friendship, and the endurance of the human spirit in overcoming trauma.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
PAIGE
The wolf is standing just off the road, something dead and bloody hanging from its jowls. Its amber eyes lock onto mine through the van window, so cold that a chill ripples through me. But before I can get a word out, the wolf’s gray hide vanishes into the trees as our van clunks ahead.
So fast, I start to wonder if I even saw it at all.
“Did anyone else see—”
“We’re almost there!” my younger sister, Lucy, says, tugging her earbuds free. She tucks them away and smooths her long russet-colored hair in her phone’s camera.
I look ahead to see that she’s right. We’ve driven this route every summer of our lives and know the telltale white rock. It marks the end of the road that winds up the mountain and leads to our destination: Clearwater Ridge.
To me, summer in Clearwater Ridge has always meant three things.
One, the cool, sparkling river that runs through it, sun beating through the wisps of trees overhead as you float downstream; the sounds of the birds, laughter, and the roar of the rapids in my ears. Two, the droves of wealthy vacationers filling the homes that remain locked and empty for nine months of the year. Three, my favorite people in the entire world.
One of those people hugs me the instant I step out of the van.
“I can’t breathe,” I mumble through a laugh. Audrey Covington smells of sunscreen and her coconut leave-in conditioner. The scent brings back a hundred memories of her and this place. I nearly forget about the horrible drive up here until I attempt to pull away, and my arm sticks to hers. “I’m sweating all over you.” The van’s air-conditioning broke halfway up the mountain, which prompted not only a near bout of heat exhaustion but an hour-long tirade from Mom. She’d been telling Dad to take the hunk of junk to the shop for a month. “Help me get my stuff to the room so I can cool off.”
We’re still in the driveway, and though the lush canopy of trees offers plenty of shade, the water slaps against the rocks in the distance, calling me.
“Sorry,” she says, only squeezing me harder. “I just can’t believe you’re here.”
“I know. But seriously, let go.” She does, pulling back and looking over me the way my grandmother does every Christmas. “You’re being weird.”
Still, I look at her too: she’s the same Audrey as always. She’s wearing ripped jean shorts and a lacy white crop top over a floral bikini. Her face is bare, save a swipe of shimmering bronzer and a coat of pink lip gloss. Her blond hair is pulled up in a bun that’s somehow perfectly messy. The kind that would take me forty-five minutes to replicate, which is why my long sweaty brown hair is in a ponytail, as usual. My ponytail is never perfectly messy—just the regular kind of messy.
