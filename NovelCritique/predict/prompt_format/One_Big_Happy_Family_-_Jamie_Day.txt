The Precipice is a legendary, family-owned hotel on the rocky coast of Maine. With the recent passing of their father, the Bishop sisters—Iris, Vicki, and Faith—have come for the weekend to claim it. But with a hurricane looming and each of the Bishop sisters harboring dangerous secrets, there's murder in the air—and not everyone who checks into the Precipice will be checking out.
Each sister wants what is rightfully hers, and in the mix is the Precipe's nineteen-year-old chambermaid Charley Kelley: smart, resilient, older than her years, and in desperate straits.

### Plot Summary:
The tale unfolds at the storm-lashed Precipice Hotel, where the history and legacy of the Bishop family face a turbulent reckoning amidst Hurricane Larry's onslaught. Charley, the housekeeper, stumbles into this charged atmosphere teeming with long-held secrets and formidable familial strains. Following Brenda Black's mysterious demise, suspicion seeps amongst the Bishops and outsiders drawn to the unfolding drama, propelling Charley deeper into a convoluted narrative of treachery and allegiance shifts. 
Charley gradually pieces together Bree Bradford's true identity and intentions, unveiling her as a key architect of vengeance aimed at the Bishop family. Driven by a painful personal history tracing back to George Bishop, Bree confesses to orchestrating a meticulous revenge strategy against her father for her mother Christine’s death and against her siblings for perceived betrayals. Her calculated movements stir old family wounds within the chaotic hotel setting, each event revealing another facet of her deeply rooted animosity. 
Having poisoned George Bishop, Bree leaves a wake of chaos for her siblings to navigate, intent on revenge for her childhood lost in foster care. As the hurricane intensifies, so do tensions, with the confrontation between Bree and her targets coming dangerously near to irreversible catastrophe. Quinn Bishop, despite his tumultuous personal revelations, plays a crucial role in pushing his family towards awareness and resolution. His quest to reclaim a significant familial painting from Bree catalyzes a harrowing stormy cliffside clash that nearly ends in tragedy. 
Bree’s plot culminates in a standoff involving a fired gunshot that unnervingly misses its mark. In a heart-stopping moment, Bree loses her balance, ultimately choosing to let go rather than be saved, leaving Charley and her companions grappling with the physical and emotional consequences of a family implosion mirroring the storm’s fury. Charley later finds solace in a letter left by Bree, granting her a painting and insight into personal and familial machinations, providing solace and setting her on a path towards closure and growth.
Months later, Charley’s life has changed course owing to the revelations and the material aid from the Bishop sisters enabling her to forge a new beginning. The once tempestuous hotel now becomes the backdrop against which new relationships, responsibilities, and realizations unfold. Charley reconnects with Quinn, suggesting potential for renewed friendships and romantic ties amidst the newly calm sea that once mirrored their turmoil.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The power flickers on and off, as if the hotel is taking a dying gasp. I draw in a breath and hold it, but thankfully the lights come on as the wind dies down. It’s cold comfort. In a matter of time, they’ll go out again, and eventually they’ll stay out. I’m standing in the alcove directly off our Great Room with my hands clenched into fists. The anticipation is killing me.
Driving rain pelts the exterior like thousands of fingers tapping against the roof and walls. A monster is knocking to get in. This particular monster has a name. The meteorologists call him Larry, the most powerful hurricane to ravage the coast of Maine since Gerda made landfall back in 1969. A large tree is blocking the steep road leading up to the Precipice Hotel. The road itself is a rolling river of mud, impassable on foot or by car. There is no way out. No place for me to go. But I can’t stay here.
I scope out my surroundings, planning my escape route before the lights go out again. Sure enough, a fresh gust gradually crescendos into a loud roar. The hotel shakes, and just as I feared, everything goes dark. My breath catches in my throat as a band of fear pulls tight across my chest.
I turn around, taking a tentative step forward, trying to orient myself in this void. Memory is my guide. I’ve worked as a housekeeper here for the last two years. “Chambermaid” is my official title, which is super outdated, misogynistic, and way uncool, but so was my boss. I should know this place like the back of my hand, but anxiety seems to have short-circuited my brain.
My biggest problem is that this hotel is full of stuff. It’s like an antique shop of countless treasures and curiosities, transformed into a funky travel destination in Nowhere, Maine.
If I have my bearings, the grand staircase in our Great Room is to the left, but that goes to the second floor, and I want to go out, not up. There’s an exit through the foyer, and I inch my way toward it. I don’t have much time.
I take several small, cautious steps, keeping both hands in front of me, using them like antennae to sense my surroundings. Outside, the wind continues to wail. In my whole life—all nineteen years of it—I’ve never heard such a terrible, bone-rattling sound. The gusts shake the walls of this sturdy structure in an unending shudder.
My breath sputters no matter how I try to calm myself. Just when I think I’m nearing the foyer, my foot connects hard with what I’m sure is a table leg. The contact makes a loud thud and I hear the sound of breaking glass when something (a tall vase, perhaps?) tumbles to the floor.
