### Premise:
For Ash Woods, practicing alchemy is a crime.
Only an elite few are legally permitted to study the science of magic―so when Ash is rejected by the Lancaster Mage’s College, he takes a job as the school’s groundskeeper instead, forced to learn alchemy in secret.
When he’s discovered by the condescending and brilliant apprentice Ramsay Thorne, Ash is sure he's about to be arrested―but instead of calling the reds, Ramsay surprises Ash by making him an offer: Ramsay will keep Ash's secret if he helps her find the legendary Book of Source, a sacred text that gives its reader extraordinary power.
As Ash and Ramsay work together and their feelings for each other grow, Ash discovers their mission is more dangerous than he imagined, pitting them against influential and powerful alchemists―Ash’s estranged father included. Ash’s journey takes him through the cities and wilds across New Anglia, forcing him to discover his own definition of true power and how far he and other alchemists will go to seize it.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Snow drifted from the gray sky—slowly at first, lazily, the sort that was caught on eyelashes and tongues. Ramsay gripped her mother’s hand as she crunched across the frozen dirt, ice like glass shattering beneath her boots. The thin white trees were covered in knots that looked like dozens of eyes watching as they passed. Puffs of steam left her mouth as she breathed hard, trying to keep up with her mother’s long strides. Ramsay’s many questions had been ignored. She was only told to hurry, don’t stop now, they were almost there. Ramsay complained that she was cold, but Amelia only tightened her grasp.
“Come along,” she said, voice gentle. “It’s almost time.”
They crossed a frozen river. Her father had always told her not to walk along the river in the winter. The surface was too thin. It could crack, and she could be washed away, never to be seen again. Her mother let go of Ramsay’s hand and told her to wait there, right there, right where she was. Ramsay pulled on the ends of her shirt nervously while she watched her mother walk to the other end of the riverbank, back onto the solid ground of snow. She stood in a clearing of the trees and looked over her shoulder at Ramsay with a loving smile.
“The snow began to fall faster, then—hard enough that Ramsay had to shield her eyes from the ice that stung her cheeks. The world became a white blur. The snow turned red. It fell to the ground, drops spreading like blots of ink. The blood dripped from Amelia’s cheeks. Her smile faded as the screams began.
Ash was lost in thought, as usual, when he saw the alchemist he wanted to meet. Gresham Hain strode through the beige stone corridor with purpose, surrounded by a group of chattering scribes. Ash had only ever seen Hain in grainy black-and-white photos in the texts he’d written, but it was definitely him. He was a pale-skinned man nearing his sixties, but his back was straight, frame muscular, and though his hair had turned a stark white, it was full, gray stubble on his jaw. Ash had heard that Hain sometimes visited the college. The man was an advisor to House Alexander, but he was technically still a professor, though he rarely taught classes or took on apprentices. Ash had often imagined this moment—imagined finding enough courage to march up to Gresham Hain and tell the man his name.
As Ash watched Hain striding toward him, his anger grew. The rage became a mirage of heat that glowed from his skin, a second pulse inside him. Ash’s hands clenched into fists. Ash hated Hain, hated him enough to want to scream at him and hit him and—
“Excuse me,” Ash said. His voice cracked. “Sir Hain, I’m—”
