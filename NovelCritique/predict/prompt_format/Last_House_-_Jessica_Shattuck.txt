### Premise:
It’s 1953, and for Nick Taylor, WWII veteran turned company lawyer, oil is the key to the future. He takes the train into the city for work and returns to the peaceful streets of the suburbs and to his wife, Bet, former codebreaker now housewife, and their two children, Katherine and Harry. Nick comes from humble origins but thanks to his work for American Oil, he can provide every comfort for his family, including Last House, a secluded country escape. Deep in the Vermont mountains, the Taylors are free from the stresses of modern life. Bet doesn’t have to worry about the Russian H-bombs that haunt her dreams, and the children roam free in the woods. Last House is a place that could survive the end of the world.
It’s 1968, and America is on the brink of change. Protestors fill the streets to challenge everything from the Vietnam War to racism in the wake of MLK’s shooting—to the country's reliance on Big Oil. As Katherine makes her first forays into adult life, she’s caught up in the current of the time and struggles to reconcile her ideals with the stable and privileged childhood her Greatest Generation parents worked so hard to provide. But when the Movement shifts in a more radical direction, each member of the Taylor family will be forced to reckon with the consequences of the choices they’ve made for the causes they believed in.
Spanning multiple generations and nearly eighty years, "Last House" tells the story of one American family during an age of grand ideals and even greater downfalls.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Abadan, 1953
The first time Nick Taylor saw Abadan oil field, it was out the window of an airplane. Initially, it looked like a burned-out forest, the pipes and columns and laddered derricks like a wilderness of bare trunks and fallen trees. But then it resolved itself into what it was: a vast and complex apparatus for harvesting the lifeblood of modernity.
Nick knew about oil. As a boy growing up in Wisconsin, he had been interested in geology. He understood that below the crust of the earth lay dark rivers and lakes of crude, and that crude was made of compressed corpses—the bodies of once-living things: plants and algae and microbial beings. He understood that its excavation was a kind of resurrection. That all these dead things, so long gone, would now animate the world.
But right now, the hammers and pistons of the oil field below were immobile, the giant lake of crude locked up like a safe. Production was stalled due to a thorny political impasse: Iran had evicted Anglo-Iranian Oil, the British company that had built and reaped the profits of the Abadan refinery. Whoever could get the oil flowing again would gain access to one of the world’s largest oil fields.
This was of great interest to the men on this plane.
To Nick, the flight that night felt like a treacherous oil-industry cocktail party. He did not like flying, which he associated with the war, and he was wary of being trapped for hours with his colleagues, all growing steadily drunker, himself included, in a tin vessel thousands of feet above the earth. He was a junior lawyer for the American Oil legal team, and this was his first trip to the Middle East. He felt an irrational, gnawing concern that his boss, George Monroe, who was three sheets to the wind already, would look at him and say: What the hell is this kid doing here? Although he wasn’t a kid. He was thirty years old, a veteran of a world war, a husband and a father of two, a property owner in the state of Connecticut. But something about Monroe’s bearing, the thick jowls and swaggering bravado of his speech, suggested that underneath his boardroom success, he had the instincts of a grade-school bully. The war had taught Nick to spot that sort of thing.
The only women on this plane were two stewardesses, one of whom was chatting up a group of oilmen at the front. The other, a thin, dark-haired girl, seemed nonplussed by her colleague’s fraternizing and delivered beverages with a nurse’s brisk, slightly reproving authority. On Nick’s way to the lav, he caught her standing at the cramped service counter, surreptitiously reading.
“Good book?” he asked, and she jumped like a startled deer.
“Just a silly novel.”
