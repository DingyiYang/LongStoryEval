### Title: Even If It Breaks Your Heart

### Genres: Romance, Young Adult, Contemporary

### Premise:
A heart-buckling ride of a romance by beloved author Erin Hahn, Even If It Breaks Your Heart is about two teens finding out that sometimes, the hardest part of discovering what you want is getting the courage to pursue it.
The only thing keeping nineteen-year-old Case Michaels together after the death of his best friend, Walker, is a list Walker left behind of things he wants Case to accomplish in his absence. So far, though, Case hasn’t even been able to continue riding bulls in the rodeo circuit, something he’s done his entire life, balking at the thought of competing without Walker by his side. But the list? Case is determined to follow it to the letter– and he follows it all the way to Winnie Sutton.
Eighteen-year-old Winnie Sutton just wants to keep her family together. She graduated high school early to work long shifts at the Michaels family ranch so she can support her younger siblings and a father who’s more than happy to let Winnie fill the responsible parent role. If she sometimes sneaks out to ride the horses herself and forget about life for a while– well, that’s no one else’s business– until the day she crashes headfirst into Case Michaels. Case sees her riding skills and immediately ropes her into competing for the ranch and becoming his friend.
Winnie and Case couldn’t be more different, but Case can’t help but be inspired by Winnie’s badly-hidden passion for riding and competition. And there’s something about Case that makes Winnie want to try grasping onto a dream for herself, whether that’s a shot at a rodeo trophy, the annoyingly handsome rancher’s son who won’t leave her alone, or maybe both.

### Plot Summary:
The narrative follows Case Benton Michaels and Winnie Sutton, set against the vibrant backdrop of Texas rodeo culture. Case, an aspiring nurse and rodeo athlete, navigates the aftermath of his best friend Walker Gibson's death, learning to honor Walker's legacy while establishing his own path in pediatric nursing at Texas Tech. This journey reveals his compassionate nature and intention to make a difference, highlighted by his work with young cancer patient Ryder. Additionally, Case confronts expectations from his father, Junior, and finds support and shared understanding with Brody Gibson, Walker’s older brother, guiding him to pursue aspirations aligned with his nurturing disposition.
Concurrently, Winnie Sutton is depicted as a determined barrel racer and caretaker for her siblings, Garrett and Jesse. Her transformation from family caretaker to a competitive athlete is vital, bolstered by Case’s love and encouragement. A significant breakthrough occurs as Winnie gains confidence following her competitive triumph over rival Christine Reynolds and starts forging new connections. This newfound assurance is evident at Maria's party, marking a social turning point for Winnie, further solidifying her bond with Case.
Family dynamics shift when Winnie's father secures a new job, allowing her the freedom to pursue her rodeo career. This transition is bittersweet, as she grapples with feelings of liberation and perceived dismissal from caregiving duties. Her potential move to a cabin provided by Camilla underscores her internal conflict between independence and family obligations. Overcoming initial resistance, Winnie reassures her siblings, particularly Garrett, of their continued bond, gifting her a phone to maintain constant communication.
For Case, sharing his career aspirations with his father unravels complex emotions, stemming from Junior's vulnerability rather than disapproval. Together with Brody, Case emphasizes individual aspirations and honors Walker’s memory through their rodeo achievements, marking a transition into new beginnings and shared understanding.
In the epilogue, Case, Winnie, Maria, and Pax celebrate New Year’s Eve atop a water tower, highlighting their individual achievements: Winnie’s success as a rookie barrel-racing champion, Maria’s triumphs in her debut professional season, Pax’s relationship and academic accomplishments, and Case’s academic excellence and rodeo success. As these milestones are celebrated, Case and Winnie reflect on their relationship’s depth, reaffirming their love and commitment despite impending challenges such as long-distance. The segment concludes with them embracing the future, reminiscent yet hopeful.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“I’ll be honest, man, this is a lot higher than I’d thought it would be.”
Walker doesn’t say anything, but the word wuss hangs in the crisp night air between us, hovering amid the clouded breath repeatedly pulled from my chest. Fuck, I hate heights. Always have. I fight the urge to look down, down, down, past my dusty boots dangling too many feet above the earth.
“Corn silo,” I mutter before turning to him. “You said corn silo, right?” Wrapping a single arm around the cold metal frame, I accidentally clink the glass bottle grasped in my freezing fingers against it. I lift an ass cheek and dig with the other hand in my back pocket. I pull out a worn piece of paper and use my teeth to unfold it, squinting and lifting it to the pale glow of moonlight overhead.
“Right here. Jump off a corn silo,” I read aloud. I throw my head back with a groan. “Fuck, we’re so stupid.” I glare at my best friend pointedly as I start to shiver. I didn’t bring a coat up here. “Grain bin.” I gesture to the wide metal bins approximately thirty feet below me. “You meant jump off a grain silo. I can’t jump off this—I’ll die.”
The last words strangle in my throat, and I take another long pull from one of the Dr Peppers I’ve lugged up here with me. Walker shakes his head full of dirty-blond hair, his smirk knowing, his lean frame balanced precariously on the bin’s edge. I can barely make out the lettering across his chest, but I recognize his favorite shirt and know it reads GIVE ’EM HELL. Whether he’s shaking his head to say, Don’t die! or What’s the big deal? or You’re the dumbass who climbed up here! I’m not sure. I look at the paper again, holding it up.
“Your handwriting is barely legible,” I say. He rolls his eyes. It’s an old argument. As a kid, Walker spent so much time with medical tubes stuck in his hands, he learned to write on a tablet.
“Well, I’m not fucking jumping off a corn silo. What other death traps are on this list?”
A cloud passes over the moon, and I crush the paper in my fist. Not like I can read it up here, anyway. “Unbelievable,” I mutter. Suddenly, the bottle slips in my fingers, and I jerk to grip it, throwing my center off-balance. For a heart-thudding moment, I fight to remain safely seated on the narrow ledge of the silo, and the paper drops from my grasp. My gasp is carried away on the breeze, and dark spots blur my vision as Walker’s crumpled list floats lazily toward the earth. A beat later, the bottle I’m holding follows with a faint, tinkling shatter on the near-frozen ground.
I wrap my entire arm around the bar, resting my forehead against the icy metal. “Now what?”
