Yet when she’s chosen to wed the crown prince, Ying’s dreams of a fairy tale marriage quickly fall apart.

Worse still are the rumors that swirl around the imperial whispers of seven other royal brides who, after their own weddings, mysteriously disappeared.
Left alone with only her own reflection for company, Ying begins to see things. Strange things. Movements in the corners of her mirror. Colorful lights upon its surface. And when, on the eve of her wedding, she unwittingly tears open a gateway, she is pulled into a mirror world.
This realm is full of sentient reflections, including the enigmatic Mirror Prince. Unlike his real-world counterpart, the Mirror Prince is kind and compassionate, and before long Ying falls in love—the kind of love she always dreamed of.
But there is darkness in this new world, too.

### Plot Summary:
Ying Yue, a princess marked by a prophecy, becomes pivotal in the battle against a mirrored alternate world that threatens her realm. As she navigates political intrigues and personal losses, Ying's development is anchored by her mystical abilities as "the Fish" and her complex relationship with Prince Shan Zhang Lin. They confront familial and imperial betrayals, notably the empress's plot to poison the emperor, further embroiling them in a war between worlds. Growing in strength through guidance from the mystical Mei Po, Ying explores her powers and potential. Mei Po's guidance points toward sealing the mirrored world's gateway, pushing Ying and the prince to expedite their union to tap into their combined strength. Even as personal dynamics intensify, external tensions mount with the mirror world army, led by the menacing Mirror Prince, a reflection of a personal affection turned enemy. 
As the emperor falls to poison and absolute rule shatters, Ying and Prince Zhang focus on understanding their destined roles, discovering that their essence, energy, and spirit can unite to form the "Three Treasures," a pivotal key to restoring balance. The prince battles with strategic leadership, his loyalties to family and legacy motivating him against mirror assaults. Meanwhile, Ying's internal growth embodies a fiery passion, recognizing the water-based abilities of her heritage bind her fate to the realm's continuity. The full moon triggers relentless hostilities, with Ying facing off against the Mirror Prince in a dire confrontation underscored by their past. The rising tension and magical creatures, particularly the fire crows, heighten the stakes as she guides her powers toward saving her world.
In a critical juncture, Mei Po sacrifices herself to protect the realm, catalyzing Ying’s understanding that she must seal the threatening portal herself. Her pledge aligns with Prince Zhang’s, intertwining destiny and budding love. Throughout the ordeal, Ying confronts her fears, the burden of leadership, and an oppressive mirror-image army. Ultimately, in a decisive act driven by her fate, Ying merges jīng, qì, and shén—essence, energy, and spirit—tying them to the prophecy and embracing her role as the Phoenix. Accepting her transformation, she stares into mortality’s eyes as she leaps into a heroic tempest to halt the mirror world’s siege and fulfill her destiny.
After repelling the mirror army with her newfound elemental powers, Ying successfully seals the gateway by drawing heat from the lake, freezing it and the pathway to the mirror world. However, her victory is bittersweet, marred by the loss of her prince. In a miraculous twist, Ying’s love revives Prince Zhang, reaffirming their bond. Recognizing Ying’s leadership and accomplishments, Zhang publicly relinquishes the throne to her, solidifying her as Empress. Together, they embark on a shared reign, promising to lead their people with empathy and strength, melding their destinies in an era of peace and reconstruction.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The sky was strewn with pepper-pot stars, reflected in the pond below. On the water’s surface, the mirror image of Ying Yue’s face floated, pale and moonlike, distorted by ripples.
“My lady,” a voice behind her said. “Shall I fill the bath?”
Ying was at the edge, on her knees, bent over the water. It was an unusual position for a noblewoman, but she had never been one for following rules. She didn’t turn around or get up. Instead, she raised a hand, dismissing her handmaiden. “No thank you, Li Ming. I will bathe myself tonight.”
Li Ming retreated, silent as the wind.
Ying sighed. She was supposed to be preparing for tomorrow, but her stomach was in knots.
She forced herself to breathe in, then out. You’ll be fine.
Frustrated, Ying flipped her long hair over one shoulder to keep it from getting wet. Then, reaching down, she cupped her hands together and dipped them in the water. It was icy but crystal clear. Bending close to the pond’s surface, she drew her hands up and sluiced water over her face.
Something caught her eye: a splash from the far side of the pond. Ying jumped and sat back on her heels. Her heart sped up. The back of her neck prickled.
She wasn’t alone.
The ripples radiated outward until the water lapped at the pond’s edge. It was lucky the ground was paved with stones, else Ying would have been kneeling in mud.
She rose to her feet in one fluid movement and adjusted the skirt of her hànfú, its golden embroidery scarlike against the red satin of the robe. With her eyes trained on the water, she listened, heart fluttering like a caged bird.
The ripples faded. The pond became smooth again; reflective, like glass. Ying exhaled. Just a fish, she thought. Earlier she’d seen carp milling about at the surface, clamoring for food, their huge, muscular bodies glinting silver in the moonlight. Surely it was one of them that had caused the splash.
The pond was an ornamental feature in the expansive gardens wrapping around Ying’s private quarters. On the morrow, she was to wed the emperor’s only son, Prince Shan Zhang Lin, in an elaborate three-stage ceremony. As the future crown princess and, eventually, empress of the powerful Shan Dynasty, she was afforded certain privileges.
The garden was one. She’d always loved nature, and when she had first arrived at the Imperial Palace three months prior, she had been delighted to find her own private oasis. Her first day had been spent trailing her hand through the swinging willow branches, breathing in the lush fragrance of the abundant exotic blooms, and watching the colorful carp swimming in lazy circles beneath the water. She’d marveled at the pond, its surface a delicate green and dotted with lotus flowers. It had been so beautiful. It was so beautiful. At the time, she’d been touched. The prince obviously wanted to make her happy.
