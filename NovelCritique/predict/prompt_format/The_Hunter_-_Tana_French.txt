### Plot Summary:
In the small Irish village of Ardnakelty, the murder of Terence Blake, alias Cillian Rushborough, rattles the community. Initial suspicion falls on Johnny Reddy due to his questionable dealings. Trey, Johnny's insightful daughter, discovers Rushborough's body, implicating her in the investigation and connecting her to Cal Hooper, an ex-cop turned local resident involved with Lena, a key community mediator.
Detective Nealon probes the case, enlisting Cal’s expertise to navigate the village's intricate social threads. Trey's initial deception in her statement to protect Johnny inadvertently implicates Cal, straining their dynamic. Lena's interaction, laced with humor and strategy, helps propel the narrative amidst growing rumors about her relationship with Cal.
The investigation underscores old resentments linked to Johnny's antics, unraveling Ardnakelty's tightly wound social fabric. Trey's changed testimony spotlights Johnny under increasing scrutiny. As these tensions rise, Trey seeks her footing amid familial strife and communal discord. It's unveiled that Sheila, Trey's mother, committed the murder to protect her family from Rushborough, who manipulated Johnny’s debts as leverage.
Amid climaxing discord, Mart and fellow townsfolk confront Johnny, sparking ideas of retribution. As a massive fire engulfs the mountain area, ignited by Sheila to obscure her tracks, Cal and Johnny rally to rescue Trey. Though injured, Trey escapes the blaze. Meanwhile, Sheila seeks refuge for her family at Lena's, contemplating new possibilities.
As Johnny schemes for an exit, acknowledging his defeat, prevailing themes of loyalty and protection emerge. Trey evolves into a deft, morally grounded character shaped by her experiences while Cal grows into a steadfast guardian figure through the unfolding turmoil.
The fire and subsequent chaos force characters into introspection and decision-making. Sheila, with her home's destruction, ponders a life beyond it, while Lena and others manage the upheaval and shelter provided to Sheila’s family. Cal and Trey, processing the intense sequence of events, find space for reflection. Trey's action of changing her statement reflects a significant departure from revenge, suggesting internal growth and autonomy.
Mart's banter with Cal post-fire hints at a potential conspiracy to rid the village of Johnny.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Trey comes over the mountain carrying a broken chair. She carries it on her back, with the legs sticking out round her waist and held over her shoulders. The sky is a blue so hot it looks glazed, and the sun is burning the back of Trey’s neck. Even the faint pin-sharp calls of birds, too high up to be seen, vibrate with heat. The woman who owns the chair offered Trey a lift back with it, but Trey has no inclination to let the woman into her business, and neither the inclination nor the ability to make conversation for the length of a car journey over the potholed mountain roads.
Her dog Banjo lollops in wide circles off the path, snuffing and burrowing among the thick heather, which is too brown-edged and heavily scented for July. It makes crisp rattling sounds as he pushes through it. Every few minutes he comes bounding back to tell Trey, with small happy puffs and moans, what he’s found. Banjo is a mutt, black and tan, with a beagle’s head and body set on the legs of something stubbier, and he’s a lot more talkative than Trey is. He got his name from a banjo-shaped patch of white on his belly. Trey wanted something better for him, but her mind doesn’t run easily to fancy things, and everything she came up with sounded like what some tosser out of a schoolbook would call a dog. In the end she left it at Banjo. Cal Hooper, the American who lives down near the village, has Banjo’s litter-mate and named him Rip, and if a plain name is good enough for Cal’s dog, it’s good enough for Trey’s. Besides, she spends much of her waking time at Cal’s place, meaning the two dogs spend much of their time together, and it would sound stupid if they didn’t match.
Cal’s place is where Trey is taking the chair, later on. Cal and Trey mend furniture for people, or make it, and they buy old wrecked furniture and fix it up to sell at the Saturday market in Kilcarrow town. One time they picked up a side table that to Trey looked useless, too little and spindly to hold anything worthwhile, but when Cal went on the internet it turned out to be almost two hundred years old. When they got through with it, they sold it for a hundred and eighty quid. The chair Trey is carrying has two stretchers and one leg in splinters, like someone gave it the kind of kicking that takes time and dedication, but once she and Cal get done with it, no one will be able to tell it was ever broken.
