### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Iease up on the steering wheel, my white knuckles slowly turning back to pink as I pass the city limit sign for Parkerville, Maine. A cross-country move in a U-Haul probably wasn’t my smartest move, considering I hate driving and I’ve never been behind the wheel of anything bigger than a sedan.
Hiring movers and flying would’ve been the easiest route, but I wanted to do this on my own, and I needed this road trip to clear my head.
I left everything I knew in California, but with my divorce finalized, I couldn’t stay there anymore. It no longer felt like home.
And more than anything, I need a massive change in my life.
The old me would’ve never quit her job, and she never would have purchased a building sight unseen in a city she’s never even visited.
That’s right. Not just a house—a whole building.
The new me? She’s desperate to break free of the confines she put herself in a long time ago.
I want new adventures. I want to do things I’ve never had the chance to do since I married young and put all my focus first into getting a law degree, then into my work. All that effort, and look what that got me. Unhappiness and a divorce, to boot.
Inhaling a shaky breath, I glance at the glowing green lights of the clock on the dash.
11:11
I close my eyes and make a wish.
I wish for this move to be the right thing.
Quickly, I focus on the road again, scanning my surroundings.
Maybe it’s cheesy to wish on numbers, or on shooting stars, but I’ll take all the potential luck the universe tosses my way.
As I navigate the unfamiliar streets of the small town, I send up a silent thank-you to said universe that it’s nearly midnight. There isn’t a soul around when I pull up outside the old brick building. The lower level will soon be renovated into an art studio, and the apartment on the second story is where I’ll be living. I didn’t see the point in buying a house when I discovered that little perk.
I sag against the steering wheel as I take in the details of the structure. When I purchased it, I knew it would need a lot of work, but knowing and seeing are two totally different things.
