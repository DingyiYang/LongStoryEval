### Genres: Thriller, Mystery, Mystery Thriller

### Premise:
9 hours, 43 minutes 
When Anna Hartley’s husband, Henry, calls her with a terrible, guilty confession, she can’t believe what she hears. It has to be a bad joke—the mild, predictable artist she married would never hurt a fly, let alone commit murder. But her confusion turns to horror when police find his body washed up on the banks of the Rio Grande. 
Desperate for answers to the millions of questions his untimely death has raised, Anna checks in to The Sycamores, the run-down motel turned apartment Henry rented as an art studio. As she absorbs every bit of gossip the eclectic mix of residents are willing to share about her husband and each other, she begins to piece together a picture of a very different man than the one she married, and the life he led behind her back. The more she learns, and the less sense things seem to make, she finds herself wondering: Did she ever really know Henry at all? 
But Henry’s secrets aren’t the only ones; as Anna’s search for clues expands, Cass, the mysterious, jaded motel manager, seems more and more determined to keep Anna in the dark. And when threatening letters start appearing at her door, Anna has to decide what’s more important—the truth, or her own safety.

### Plot Summary:
Anna, deeply affected by her husband Henry's mysterious death, begins unraveling the secrets of The Sycamores, a peculiar residential community at the core of her investigation. Her quest for truth intertwines with personal betrayal as she discovers Henry’s affair with Lily through a significant video on his laptop. The unraveling chaos places Anna in the orbit of Cass, who is linked to Eddie’s dangerous undertakings.
Caught between clarifying Henry’s secrets and her safety, Anna’s interactions with the residents, including a wary relationship with Cass, paint a grim picture of The Sycamores' entangled lives. Cass, initially a reluctant participant burdened with guilt over past deeds and Eddie’s death, finds unlikely allies in Anna and Rosa. Together, they piece together Callum’s sinister machinations, who is cleverly masked as an ally but is indeed responsible for much of the upheaval at The Sycamores.
The narrative reaches its turning point when Callum captures Anna, revealing his truly malevolent nature. With Rosa and Cass using a GPS tracker, they stage a daring rescue culminating in a confrontation in Diablo Canyon. In a climactic sequence, they outmaneuver Callum using cunning strategy and courage, ensuring his capture without further ensnaring themselves in his web of deceit.
As the dust settles, Anna moves to Ibiza, entering a period of introspection and reconciliation with the past. She communicates regularly with Cass, Rosa, and others from the community through video calls, finding comfort in these connections. Anna contemplates her unresolved feelings about Henry and her life choices, leading her to revisit her dream of writing. Inspired to narrate her story from Henry’s death to her confrontation with Callum, she submits her narrative to a publication, embracing her path toward healing and honoring Henry’s memory.

The increased attention prompts Reid to rekindle their relationship, offering a glimpse into her previous life.

By choosing to stay and support Frank, a child who depends on her, she solidifies her role in this homegrown family.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
CASS
There’s a Shell gas station across the street. That was the first thing I noticed when I moved here because I arrived at dusk and the sign’s S was burned out. As I approached the motel, the only thing I could see on the dusty horizon was the word HELL lit up in orange and yellow, which seems appropriate once you get to know the area. I only saw the sad S hanging off the billboard by a hinge and swinging ominously as I got closer, and I wish to God that I took it as an omen and turned around.
There are a few other landmarks on this desolate stretch of two-lane highway between The Sycamores apartments and the good side of town—an Arby’s, a Motor Inn, Larry’s liquor store, some strip malls with hand-painted signs, and Teaser’s Gentlemen’s Club.
I shuddered when I saw this dump that’s now my home. It used to be a motel, and they didn’t even change the name. It’s three strips of two-story building connected in a U shape, with a dumpy pool in the middle. They renovated the motel rooms to be apartments...sort of. They are now slightly-better-than-a-shitty-motel-style apartments with a couple bedrooms, but they didn’t even change out the paisley carpet or burgundy drapes. I literally gasped when I first laid eyes on the semen-stained bedspread in my fully furnished oasis.
Room 10. It used to be apartment 100, but one of the zeros is missing, and in its place is a gash that looks like someone once took a machete to it, but I don’t ask questions. It’s the smallest apartment and sits adjacent to the boiler room, so now I’m Cass from room 10. It’s so pathetic the others don’t even consider it an apartment.
I’m used to it now. The shock wore off weeks ago, and here I still am, just after Christmastime, curled up in front of my window with a Brandy Alexander, watching sleet tap the icy pool water’s surface with a backdrop of Barry from number 206 trying to jump-start his pickup in the parking lot.
I think I’ll start to cry again, so I close the hideous drapes and sit in front of my laptop at the table. The tears don’t come. Today is one of those numb days, as it turns out.
