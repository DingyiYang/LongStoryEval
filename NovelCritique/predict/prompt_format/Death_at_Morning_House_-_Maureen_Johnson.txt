### Title: Death at Morning House

### Genres: Mystery, Young Adult, Mystery Thriller

### Premise:
The fire wasn’t Marlowe Wexler’s fault. Dates should be hot, but not hot enough to warrant literal firefighters. Akilah, the girl Marlowe has been in love with for years, will never go out with her again. No one dates an accidental arsonist.
With her house-sitting career up in flames, it seems the universe owes Marlowe a new summer job, and that’s how she ends up at Morning House, a mansion built on an island in the 1920s and abandoned shortly thereafter. It’s easy enough, giving tours. Low risk of fire. High chance of getting bored talking about stained glass and nut cutlets and Prohibition.
Oh, and the deaths. Did anyone mention the deaths?

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):

Petrichor. That’s how this all started—from a single smell. Do you know this word? I learned it from Akilah Jones.
Akilah, Akilah, Akilah . . .
I first set eyes on her in freshman-year French. She was conjugating the absolute hell out of her first irregular verb and wearing a soft yellow sweater when I realized I was in love with her. I always knew I liked girls, but when I saw Akilah, I knew knew. I genuinely don’t understand how you could see Akilah and not fall in love with her. The lift of her chin. Her ever-changing hair—braided, straight, natural, sometimes shot through with purple stripes. She played piano in our school’s jazz band. She also played guitar. She smiled like she knew the joke you were about to tell and was already laughing. And her laugh? Like the bells of a cathedral.
I’d had four classes with her in total—freshman French I; biology and first-semester American history in sophomore year; and English III this last year. I usually didn’t get to sit close to her, because my last name is Wexler and a lot of teachers go alphabetically, but our English teacher let us pick our own seats at six tables around the room. Unfortunately, I was late on the first day and her table was full, but I snagged a pretty good seat nearby and basked in the warmth of her magnificence. I always tried to look my best before I got there, but I’m not working with what Akilah is working with.
I’m fine. I’m Marlowe Wexler and I’m fine.
My name makes it sound like I spend my time lurking around the shadowy alleyways of some big city. One of those alleyways full of old boxes, metal trash cans, and cats that knock things over and make that yowlllll sound. Like there’s a bartender who knows my name somewhere. Like I have three ex-wives and I don’t talk to two of them but there’s something smoldering between me and the third one. We never got over each other. My name is more exciting than I am. Akilah was exceptional, and I was fine, and that was the problem.
I never got to spend any real time with her until that summer when we both got jobs at Guffy’s, our local ice cream place. Guffy’s has thirty-two homemade flavors and locally famous hot caramel sauce. Say you want your cone “hot bottom” and you’ll get some of the caramel pooled into the bottom of your cone and everyone will laugh except us, because you can only hear this so many times before you think about putting your hand inside the waffle iron just to feel something again.
