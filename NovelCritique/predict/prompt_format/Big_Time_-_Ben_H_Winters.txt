### Premise:
Grace
The best part of Grace’s job at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health is that she can clock out at five. She’s got things to do--like care for her aging, cantankerous mother, her angsty and remarkably bright teenager--with little time for herself to spare. Which is why Grace is peeved when in the late evening, she's called into work. A woman has appeared at a local hospital, injured, shaken, and with an unusual portacath implanted in her chest. The hospital cannot recognize the model. As Grace investigates, the scant info on the device's provenance appears apocryphal. What's been done to this girl? And who is behind it? 
 
 Ana
When she comes to, she realizes she’s been taken. She’s in the back seat of a black woozy, scared. She’d been asleep, and then she’d been awake, a woman with a catalog face, dressed in tailored pants and a crisp white blouse had dragged her out of her tent beneath the overpass and stabbed her in the neck. The same woman who was now in the front seat. Somehow, Ana escapes. When she arrives at a hospital in Hanover, Maryland, she’s found with an usual device attached to her body. Ana is confused, and as she tries to grasp for any memory or scrap of the past, she comes up empty. She can't remember anything.
 
 Desiree
Desiree is on fire with pain, the pulp of her right eye a bloody mess. She can’t believe the girl had blinded her, can't believe that she’d escaped. Tending to the it had set her back. And now the client is not happy. What she needs is to fulfill the mission. Desiree has a job to do, and she is almost out of time. . .

### Plot Summary:
Grace Berney, an indefatigable FDA worker, embarks on a harrowing investigation into clandestine time manipulation experiments tied to a portacath designed by Dr. C. P. Stargell. The spark of intrigue comes from a photograph of Ana, a woman believed dead, unraveling a web of deceit surrounding a staged car crash meant to conceal a failed experiment. Despite professional setbacks, including her suspension, Grace tenaciously pursues the truth, supported by her nonbinary child, River. Their discoveries lead them to expose a world where time can be manipulated, materially harvested, and appropriated as a powerful element.
Ana, at the heart of this mystery, navigates fragmented memories to uncover her past, especially concerning her stepfather Martin Ajax's involvement. Her search narrows in on Dr. Stargell on Tilghman Island, where she learns about Stargell's groundbreaking theory of time extraction. A botched experiment meant to extend life results in Ana's alternate reality, where everyone believes her dead. As she grapples with this new reality, hired gun Desiree, whose motives fluctuate between professional loyalty and personal curiosity, hunts Ana under Ajax's command.
Dr. Stargell’s astonishing concept of time as an extractable resource underlies her struggles for recognition within the scientific community, reflecting broader ethical dilemmas. Ajax, whose desperation to prevent his wife's death led to Ana's tragic experiment, concocts a scheme to commercialize time manipulation. This revelation culminates in a dangerous face-off at Ana's hideout, where Ajax's plans for exploiting the durational element collide with Ana's determination for self-preservation.
In the pivotal moments at Clare Stargell’s house, Desiree attempts to seize Stargell, seeking personal gain from unraveling the secrets of time manipulation. Grace, ignoring her physical pain and fear, charges at Desiree, thwarting her attempt to kill Ana. Despite being wounded, Grace's timely intervention allows Ana to disarm and fatally wound Desiree.
Six months later, the fallout from these events unfolds in a congressional hearing where Grace testifies about the unethical experiments. Kathy, Grace's mother, facing the limitations of age after a debilitating car accident, watches proudly yet apprehensively. Her old age and loss give her a prescient view of the future's bleak commercial exploitation of time. Ajax, now in custody awaiting trial, remains unrepentant as he prepares to address Congress, indicating his complicity and calculated involvement in the events now publicly disclosed.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second,” Allie called from the back seat.
The driver didn’t answer. The woman had said not one word this entire time, which was part of what was so terrifying about the whole thing. She just drove, not turning around, not answering Allie’s questions, acting like Allie wasn’t even back here. Allie tried to get her to engage, Allie had been trying the whole time, since the moment this lady had grabbed her from the bench at the edge of the playground and forced her across the sidewalk and into the back seat of her silver SUV.
“Hi, could you—I’m sorry, would you just talk to me? Can you look at me? Please.”
Allie tried to stay calm. She was trying to stay calm. It had been—what?—an hour? Two hours? The sun was going down. They were driving south, or at least that’s what Allie thought, she thought they were driving south, she had tried to look for landmarks but the windows were tinted and it was hard to see.
“Can you tell me where we’re going? Can you just—I’m sorry, can you just talk to me?”
The driver—the kidnapper—this strange and terribly quiet and oddly witchy woman—still refused to answer. She just drove, keeping to an even highway speed, no talking, no radio, no sound but the muted rush of the wheels. Allie stared at the back of the woman’s head, at her long black hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, at her pale thin neck.
Calm. Allie was working so hard to stay calm. You have to be rational. You can’t panic. You have to stay calm.
“Okay, look. Here’s the thing. Whoever it is that you think I am, I promise you it’s not me. You’ve got the wrong person. Can you—I’m sorry, can you hear me?”
Allie knew it was useless. A waste of words. A waste of time. If this lady, whoever she was, if she was going to respond, if she was going to take pity on her, if she was going to pull over and untie her wrists and apologize for the misunderstanding and let her go, then she would have done it already. Right?
But Allie kept talking. Kept trying. Because, yes, she knew it was useless, but she also knew that if she stopped talking, stopped trying, she would collapse into despair, she would start crying and not stop crying until this lady either killed her or dropped her in a dungeon or threw her in a hole or whatever the hell she was planning.
