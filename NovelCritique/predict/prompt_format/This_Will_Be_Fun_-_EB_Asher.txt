### Premise:
Ten years ago, they saved the realm. It ruined their lives.
Everyone in Mythria knows the story of how best friends Beatrice and Elowen, handsome ex-bandit Clare, and valiant leader Galwell the Great defended the land from darkness. It’s a tale beloved by all—except the former heroes. They haven’t spoken in a decade, devastated by what their quest cost them.
But when they receive an invitation to the queen of Mythria’s wedding, it’s a summons they can’t refuse . . . and a reunion for the ages, with Clare secretly not over his long-ago fling with Beatrice, Beatrice fighting the guilt she feels over how everything ended, Elowen unprepared for the return of her former flame (the cunning Vandra), and all of them lost without Galwell’s presence. And if reuniting with old friends and lovers wasn’t perilous enough, dark forces from their past have returned, plotting a domination that only Mythria’s one-time defenders can stop. Maybe.
Dusting off old weapons and old instincts, they face undead nemeses, crystal caves, enchanted swords, coffee shops, games of magical Truth or Dare, and, hardest of all, their past—rife with wounds never healed and romances never forgotten.
This time around, will their story end in happily ever after?

### Plot Summary:
In the mythic realm of Mythria, Clare Grandhart, Beatrice, and Elowen True, members of the legendary Four, face a dire threat from the Fraternal Order, which seeks to resurrect the formidable Todrick. Together with Hugh Mavaris, the Queen's fiancé, the group plans to thwart the Order's plot. Clare grapples with the heroic burdens he bears and is supported by Beatrice's love throughout this journey. Beatrice, a powerful mage haunted by past failures, especially her inability to save Galwell, is on her journey of redemption. Elowen, mourning her brother, draws strength from her relationship with Vandra and plays a vital role in defeating the Order with her heart magic. Vandra’s strategic mind and unwavering support for Elowen, along with Hugh’s integrity and valor, fortify the group's unity and resolve.
Disguising themselves, they infiltrate the Order's gathering to halt Todrick's resurrection. Amidst the chaos, Elowen and Vandra focus on regaining the Sword of Souls. Guided by introspection and newfound acceptance, Beatrice defies darkness and manages to empower Elowen. With her help, Elowen neutralizes the sword's power, leading to the Order's defeat. Following this victory, Clare begins to value personal integrity and love over legendary heroism, standing by Beatrice. The group, now more united and empowered, celebrates their triumph.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Galwell the Great was almost sad they would be saving the realm tomorrow.
Not, of course, because he was reluctant to defeat the dark powers wishing to rule over Mythria. He stood on the bluffs overlooking Queendom, the realm’s capital, where they would lay their siege in just one more day. The sight of Mythria, the land he loved,    corrupted with evil wounded his heart. Gone were her green hills, where one could nearly feel the magic flourishing. Instead,    foul power had seeped gray into the landscape. Over the mountainous Queendom, dreamlike in peacetime with her white stone    parapets, dark shadows loomed.
While night was falling, the sky surrounding the queen’s castle offered little in the way of sunset. Clouds of perilous magic churned, lightning crackling ominously within.
No, tomorrow he would become a hero. He would live up to the name bestowed on him as a young boy from whom everyone knew to expect greatness.
Galwell the Great.
The name never felt burdensome to him—perhaps because he was admittedly quite strong. Magically so. It was his gift, the hand magic of strength. Never did he chafe at the expectations of others, either. His noble birth, his prodigious might, and, above all, his goodness made him a person people rallied behind and believed in.
He didn’t mind that. Galwell the Great did not fear that he would fall short tomorrow. He knew he and his three companions—his sister and his two closest friends—would prevail. Mythria would be saved. Evil would be destroyed. The four of them would be heroes.
... but then what?
Prevailing, Galwell felt, was rather the problem. What was a hero’s purpose after the villains were vanquished? Who would Galwell the Great be then?
They were the sort of existential questions he’d never contended with before. What waited past the edge of greatness? Marriage to his betrothed, the princess, he supposed, although the idea gave him only the pleasure of honoring the promises his parents made in his youth. Thessia was a nice enough princess. They would have a fine life. He would be true to her because it was the right thing to do, and doing right was all he would have to hold on to when heroism was no longer needed.
True was his surname, after all. Not “the Great.” Perhaps the honorific would fade into obsolescence. Perhaps he would remain just—Galwell True.
The idea frightened him in ways swordfighting, horsemanship, and infiltrating dark fortresses did not. Would it be enough?
It would have to be. Heroism demanded sacrifices.
Wind whipping his long auburn hair, he knelt in the dirt, offering up a silent prayer to the Ghosts, the heroes of Mythria’s founding thousands of years ago. Life lasted long past his twenty-seven years. Ghosts, grant him the wisdom—
“Galwell, please come inside.”
His sister’s voice interrupted his reverence.
