### Premise:
Ariadne Vitalis is in trouble. She's betrayed her father―and his benefactor―and now she's left to rely on the questionable mercy of Olympus to keep her safe. As with everything in this city, mercy comes with a price. For Ariadne, that means a marriage to Dionysus. She has no choice but to agree, even if there's only one man she's ever wanted―a man she's feared just as much as she desires. The Minotaur never had any illusions about Minos's plans. He was willing to get his hands dirty as long as the old man kept his word―at the end of this, the Minotaur would be given Ariadne as a reward. Nowhere in that deal was her walking down the aisle to a different man. She's meant for him, and he means to have her. Ariadne knows better than to encourage the Minotaur. Her relationship with her new fiancé might be more friendship than burning passion, but she is all too aware of how much fiery passion can hurt. She and the Minotaur are no good for each other. She can never forgive him for what he's done, and he can never change. But when his hands are on her body and his wicked words are whispered in her ear, she might just be willing to let all of Olympus burn...

### Plot Summary:
Ten weeks earlier, Ariadne defied her tyrannical father, Minos, by entering a relationship with Asterion, a key figure in the Olympus power dynamics and former enforcer for Minos. With her father's threats looming and an unexpected pregnancy, Ariadne initially sought refuge with Hades but ended up marrying Dionysus in a strategic union for safety amidst political instability. Throughout her journey, Ariadne navigated the complex political landscape of Olympus, realizing the political leverage Dionysus held, and forged alliances for her independence.
Asterion, conflicted due to his past loyalty to Minos but driven by his love for Ariadne and disdain for Minos's oppression, gathered key intelligence and aligned with influential players to challenge Minos and other powerful figures like Zeus and Hera. He received guidance from Hermes, who informed him about the threats to Olympus while furthering his own agenda.
With Asterion’s betrayal exposed, Minos sought to use Phaedra to thwart their plans. Caring most for Ariadne's safety, Asterion staged a risky escape with her and her brother, Icarus. Despite his injuries and mounting danger, Asterion stayed resolved, while Ariadne displayed ingenuity and resourcefulness, evading capture and using security feeds to outmaneuver Phaedra. She ultimately reunited with Asterion and Icarus, leading to a daring escape attempt.
Together, Asterion and Hermes disabled a facility linked to the barrier surrounding Olympus, challenging the city's defenses. Ariadne's warning to Hera led to an unexpected alliance, and the siblings anticipated Asterion's return amidst threats orchestrated by Atalanta under Athena’s command. Ultimately, the trio reached the marina, where Minos confronted them. In a desperate move, Ariadne shot Minos to save Icarus. Poseidon and his forces capitalized on the chaos, capturing Icarus, who sacrificed his freedom for Ariadne and Asterion's escape.
As tensions flared and alliances shifted, Asterion guided the boat away from danger as Circe’s ships approached. Ariadne mourned her father's death yet found solace in their newfound freedom. Meanwhile, Poseidon forcibly retained Icarus, prompting further reflection on the family and legacy Minos left behind.
In the epilogue, Icarus, now captured, reflects on his tumultuous fate, exacerbated by Athena's derision and Poseidon's forcible intervention. Poseidon, favoring pragmatic containment over execution, places Icarus in captivity, resolving that death isn't warranted despite past betrayals. Poseidon's unexpected civility contrasts Athena's cold decisiveness, highlighting differences in ideology and authority. Icarus, although subdued, vows internal rebellion, hinting at unresolved tensions and future developments.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Ten Weeks Ago
My father gave me strict instructions to stay in the house on this afternoon of blood and death. It’s the smart thing to do. No matter what else is true, I want to live. I’ve shared what information I could in the only way I knew how, and it’s up to Apollo and Cassandra to figure out the rest. Strangely, knowing that doesn’t make me feel better.
But then, I’ve always been a coward.
Tension seems to bleed into the hot and sticky afternoon air, pressing it against my skin as I slip out the back door and onto the grounds. If I was braver, I would try to warn my father’s party guests of what’s coming. I would put myself between them and danger.
Instead, I head for the maze. It’s a monstrous creation, predating my father’s ownership of this house. The previous owner was incredibly eccentric—or is, I suppose, since Hermes is here at the party right now. This house and its grounds feel like something out of a novel, a fantasy world where turning down the wrong path can land you in a portal to another realm. I’m far too old to believe in that kind of nonsense, but that doesn’t stop me from entering the maze and winding my way through the tall walls of green.
Since my father brought us to the countryside on the outskirts of Olympus, I found myself coming to the maze more and more often. Today, I don’t even have to count the turns. My feet know the path by heart. Within minutes, I reach the center.
No one else in my family bothers to come here. My father didn’t even notice that I’d absconded with several of the lawn chairs and gone so far as to plant flowers. I doubt I’ll be around next year to see them bloom, but gardening calms me all the same. Claiming this space has been the tiniest of rebellions, nothing compared to what I did at the party itself, but I can’t help the thrill that goes through me as I sink into my chair. This is as close to private as someone like me can manage. Well, except for…
I hear him well before he finds me. He makes no effort to hide the weight of his footsteps. Even though there’s a secret part of me that awakens in his presence, I can’t help the shiver of dread. Everything’s changed. It was always going to, but knowing that doesn’t bring me any peace. My father has had over a decade to put the foundations in place for this plan. To train two unstoppable killers to do his dirty work.
