### Title: Castle of the Cursed

### Genres: Fantasy, Horror, Young Adult

### Premise:
THE HOUSE IS ALWAYS HUNGRY...
After a mysterious attack claims the lives of her parents, all Estela has left is her determination to solve the case. Suffering from survivor’s guilt so intense that she might be losing her grip on reality, she accepts an invitation to live overseas with an estranged aunt at their ancestral Spanish castle, la Sombra.
Beneath its gothic façade, la Sombra harbors a trove of family secrets, and Estela begins to suspect her parents’ deaths may be linked to their past. Her investigation takes a supernatural turn when she crosses paths with a silver-eyed boy only she can see. Estela worries Sebastián is a hallucination, but he claims he’s been trapped in the castle. They grudgingly team up to find answers and as their investigation ignites, so does a romance, mistrust twined with every caress.
As the mysteries pile up, it feels to Estela like everyone in the tiny town of Oscuro is lying and that whoever was behind the attack has followed her to Spain. The deeper she ventures into la Sombra’s secrets, the more certain she becomes that the suspect she’s chasing has already found her . . . and they’re closer than she ever realized.

### Plot Summary:
Estela Amador survives the notorious Subway 25 incident and is drawn to Castillo Brálaga in Oscuro, Spain, uncovering her family's supernatural secrets. Her journey exposes her to a twin sister, Antonela, trapped by dark magic inflicted by their uncle Teo. Estela's quest transforms into a precarious mission to unravel the mysteries surrounding her, halt Antonela’s schemes, and confront Teo's manipulations, deeply intertwined with their magical ancestry and the tragic accident.
The castle is alive with the Brálaga family’s magic, particularly regarding la Sombra. Estela forms an alliance with Sebastián, a shadow beast and prince of the Bleeders. Their initially wary relationship blossoms into unwavering devotion. The castle plays host to Antonela, who aims to reclaim her physical form by manipulating the magic binding it. Estela delves deep into her ancestry’s sorcery to stop Antonela's plans, leading her to discover a significant Book foreshadowing a familial confrontation.
As Antonela’s power and schemes grow more dangerous, weaving intricate plots to regain form and power, Estela grapples with moral dilemmas, especially around family loyalties and the superstitions of Oscuro concerning la Sombra. These confrontations with her past and familial trauma fuel Estela’s resolve, culminating in a decisive clash with Antonela and Teo's manipulations.
Estela evolves from a lone survivor into a potent force against Oscuro’s mystical dangers. Her union with Sebastián uncovers deeper family truths that empower their struggle. Compassion clashes with Antonela's thirst for power, and Estela’s resolve becomes essential for healing fractured family bonds. Guided by spectral revelations, Estela gears up to trap Antonela, leading them into the fateful purple room where worlds converge.
Within this climax, Estela’s apparent vulnerability serves her plan. As Antonela attempts possession, Estela discovers an unexpected transformation, turning into purple smoke, symbolizing hope. Ultimately, Estela successfully traps Antonela’s essence within a photograph, halting her ambitions but not destroying her spirit—holding hope for a future reunion.
Thirteen months later, Estela and Sebastián settle into a new dynamic. Sebastián remains confined to the castle but adapts with renewed purpose. Estela has begun taking medical strides, maintaining her aunt’s practice while hunting down criminals to satiate Sebastián’s dark hunger. Their relationship weaves love and duty as Estela continually seeks ways to unbind Sebastián fully and reconcile Antonela's fate.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
TENDRILS OF BLACK SMOKE COIL around the metal poles of the subway train.
I blink. They’re gone.
We lurch forward, and I count twenty-six passengers, including us. Ages range from seventeen (me) to over eighty (old man behind Dad).
My parents and I ride standing, as do two women in crisp suits too clean for the colorless seats. A party of German tourists has taken over one end of the compartment, reeking of beer and tobacco. Four teen girls in pleated uniforms sit on the bench across from me, huddled close and speaking in whispers.
My gaze lingers on the students, and I wonder if I would be happy with their lives. Would I enjoy waking up every day to the same outfit, same routine, same bedroom—?
“Who are they?” asks Dad.
Arching my neck, I spy the names of the textbooks peeking out from a star-studded bag: Physics, Calculus, U.S. Government.
“Seniors.”
“That’s all you got?”
Dad sounds like he wants a challenge, so I stare harder. The students are glued to the same phone screen, which one of them holds vertically, at an awkward viewing angle. I follow the camera’s trajectory to the other end of the train, where two people are making out.
“They’re recording that couple over there—”
I fall silent as one of the girls looks up and her gaze grazes mine. I’m struck by the darkness of her irises. They’re pitch-black.
She keeps looking around, as if searching for an escape route. Unlike her friends, she hasn’t adorned herself with jewelry or makeup, and she seems more concerned with the phone than the couple it’s recording. The device is an outdated model with a single camera lens.
“They’re using the black-eyed girl’s phone,” I theorize to Dad in a low register, my voice barely audible. “Maybe some kind of social test. Could be the other three haven’t accepted her yet.”
I glance at Dad to see how I’m doing. One of his bushy brows dips as he winks his approval, and my lips stretch into a grin.
“She comes from a Dominican family,” he says under his breath, “and her mother is employed by the school, so it’s likely she’s worried about getting in trouble.” He must see my confusion because he adds, “On the platform, I overheard her speaking with her mother in Spanish on that very cell phone.”
I cross my arms, irritation singeing my cheeks. “Rules of the game are no prior information, and besides—”
“Train platform counts as part of the scene—”
“You won’t teach me Spanish!” I speak over him. “You and Mom just want to keep it as your secret language—!”
“Aren’t you too old for this game?” asks Mom. She always shuts me down when I bring up Spanish.
Or Argentina, where she and Dad are from. Or pretty much anything about the past.
