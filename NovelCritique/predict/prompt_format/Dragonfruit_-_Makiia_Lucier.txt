### Title: Dragonfruit

### Genres: Fantasy, Young Adult, Dragons

### Premise:
In the old tales, it is written that the egg of a seadragon, dragonfruit, holds within it the power to undo a person’s greatest sorrow. An unwanted marriage, a painful illness, and unpaid debt ... gone. But as with all things that promise the moon and the stars and offer hope when hope has gone, the tale comes with a warning.
Every wish demands a price.
Hanalei of Tamarind is the cherished daughter of an old island family. But when her father steals a seadragon egg meant for an ailing princess, she is forced into a life of exile. In the years that follow, Hanalei finds solace in studying the majestic seadragons that roam the Nominomi Sea. Until, one day, an encounter with a female dragon offers her what she desires most. A chance to return home, and to right a terrible wrong.
Samahtitamahenele, Sam, is the last remaining prince of Tamarind. But he can never inherit the throne, for Tamarind is a matriarchal society. With his mother ill and his grandmother nearing the end of her reign. Sam is left with two to marry, or to find a cure for the sickness that has plagued his mother for ten long years. When a childhood companion returns from exile, she brings with her something he has not felt in a very long time - hope.
But Hanalei and Sam are not the only ones searching for the dragonfruit. And as they battle enemies both near and far, there is another danger they cannot escape...that of the dragonfruit itself.

### Plot Summary:
In the Nominomi Sea's archipelago, Prince Samahti (Sam) of Tamarind embarks on a quest to secure the legendary dragonfruit to revive his comatose mother, Princess Oliana. Accompanied by Hanalei, who is deeply bonded with the mystical seadragons, they navigate familial expectations and political tensions, especially against the exploitative forces led by Captain Bragadin. The journey is fraught with challenges, from interfacing with island cultures to dealing with internal and external threats. Sam’s leadership and Hanalei’s evolving abilities prove crucial in rescuing children taken by Bragadin, who has used them to manipulate the locals. Hanalei’s seadragon marking is a key asset in overcoming Bragadin, showcasing her growth from scandal-touched beginnings to a vital partner in the mission.
The narrative is further complicated by personal tragedy, as Fetu’s loss weighs heavily on the team. Despite the emotional burden, they move forward with resolve, assisted by Moa, a defector from Bragadin’s ranks who provides critical information. As the story culminates, Sam orchestrates the children’s salvation, with Catamara’s ambiguous role in the dragonfruit’s acquisition remaining a puzzle.
The emotional aftermath of the journey involves familial confrontations, where Jejomar’s confession about using a seadragon egg for personal transformation leads to intense familial conflict and forces Sam to grapple with feelings of betrayal. Despite his actions, Sam offers Jejomar a chance to redeem himself by serving as a representative of Tamarind, accompanying William from Raka on a Nominomi expedition, highlighting themes of redemption and familial bonds.
Sam and Hanalei return to Tamarind City, attempting an innovative method to awaken Oliana using Hanalei's seadragon-infused blood. This effort is met with success, as Oliana begins to regain consciousness, symbolizing the potential for new beginnings amidst legacies of sacrifice and redemption. The epilogue ties elements of mysticism, with Catamara’s ties to seadragon deities, while examining the aftermath of treachery, survival, and transition.
Sam’s reconciliation with Jejomar demonstrates the healing after the ordeals. Jejomar learns of his transformation boundaries, allowing him to reclaim his identity, supporting his character’s redemption.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
BY THE TIME HANALEI TURNED EIGHTEEN, FIVE hundred dragoners roamed the Nominomi Sea, ships built to hunt the seadragons that called the waters home. Every part of the creatures commanded a high price: their scales for armor; their oil for lamps; their eyes, chopped and stewed, or their tongues, dried and powdered, to preserve youth and beauty. And their eggs, most precious of all, though no one had laid eyes on dragonfruit for years.
Five hundred dragoners to capture and kill. And then there was Hanalei.
“Sixty feet, would you say?” Hanalei crouched beside a wild, bushy fern, careful not to be seen. “The blue one there?”
“Sixty feet, yeah, looks good.” Her guide’s name was Moa, and his response came after much neck craning as they peered from high above the grotto into the watery cavern below. The trouble with seadragons was that they had to be observed at a distance. Unless one was willing to risk death or dismemberment, which Hanalei was not. And so practical matters: measuring their length from snout to tail, or determining eye color and approximate age, these were all things that had to be done from afar.
Three seadragons frolicked in the waves. One red, one gold, one the milky white of pearls. Two more sunned themselves on a massive stone ledge above the water’s surface. The larger one lay flat on its belly, sixty feet long, a deep blue in color. The seadragon sprawled beside it was the green of limes. Smaller by ten feet, Hanalei guessed, with a mane, or frill, that was also green. She watched its mouth open in a tremendous yawn, red tongue lolling, and felt her lips curve. It had been a long time since she had seen a pod of seadragons look so at ease, so utterly without guard.
“They are magnificent,” she said.
“They are a menace,” Moa replied, far less enchanted.
Hanalei took her eyes off the seadragons. Moa appeared to be her age. Neither short nor tall, and wiry, with skin the color of koa wood, smooth and brown. He wore loose trousers and old, comfortable sandals. The tunic he had started the day with had long been shucked off, rolled into a band and tied around his forehead to keep off the sweat. Hanalei wished she could do the same. The air was heavy and damp, perfectly still in a way that hinted at a storm coming. Even the ferns drooped. She was dressed similarly, though her white tunic remained in place and not on her head. A banana leaf hat kept the sun from her eyes, the green blending seamlessly with the surrounding jungle. She tugged the brim low and asked, “Have they hurt anyone?”
Moa nodded grimly. “Two fishermen. The first day. They were supper.”
Hanalei sobered. It was a reminder she needed sometimes, of their danger. These were not only beautiful creatures to admire and study.
