### Plot Summary:
Amidst the celebration of Concordia's Festival of the Blessing, Ganymedes (Dee) from the Fish Province, initially un-Blessed, finds himself caught in an intricate web of murder and political intrigue aboard the Dragon's Dawn. Navigating a series of escalating crises, Dee gains an unusual ability—to breathe underwater—which becomes crucial as he uncovers secrets that redefine his identity and purpose. As heirs from various provinces confront unexplained deaths and societal unrest, Dee's developing relationship with Wyatt of the Bear Province exposes deception involving Cordelia and Leofric. These secrets, coupled with the death of Cordelia’s brother, Lysander, under suspicious circumstances, spark a planned reconfiguration of the Bandage—a formidable barrier that segregates Concordia from its neighbors.
Tendai from Elephant Province becomes a mentor to Dee, providing insight into hidden motivations and guiding him through the labyrinth of shifting loyalties. Grasshopper, an earnest heir, conveys hope and innocence amid the growing chaos, contributing to Dee’s personal growth and understanding of his destiny.
Central to the story is Ravi, Dee’s former lover, whose transformative disguise powers add complexity and depth. His reappearance reveals deep-seated internal conflicts, challenging Dee to reassess his trust and embrace resilience. Ravi’s involvement becomes pivotal, propelling the narrative toward its climax, as Cordelia, devoid of restraint, enacts a dangerous plan threatening displacement and upheaval under the guise of justice.
As the plot reaches its zenith with the Dragon's Dawn malfunctioning, Dee is thrust into a decisive confrontation. With Ravi reclaiming his identity and striving to alter the world's course, Cassiopeia's challenge to Cordelia unveils her capacity to negate others' powers, cementing her role in the unfolding conflict.
In a climactic scene atop the mountain, Ravi sacrifices himself to enable Dee to absorb the Blessings, a profound transformation marked by his hair bursting with vibrant colors—a symbol of renewed life and Concordia’s potential future. This act of belief and sacrifice foreshadows a shared vision of a united world, enriched by love and understanding.
The epilogue unfolds with Dee, now empowered and leading Concordia, poised to tear down the Bandage after extensive planning and negotiation with the neighbors beyond it. Despite skepticism from figures like Senator Janus, Dee remains steadfast in his commitment to implement change. Alongside Ravi, who stands by him offering support again, he fulfills a promise for peace by granting land and protection to former enemies, asking only for peaceful coexistence in return. In a moment of introspection before the dismantling of the Bandage, Dee banishes doubts, recognizing the transformative power of unity and reconciliation to reshape Concordia's future, marking the end of an era defined by conflict and division.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
My father always says: ‘You can’t run from your responsibilities,’ but he lacks imagination. Besides, I’m not running. I’m sidestepping. Crossing the road so me and my responsibilities don’t make eye contact and aren’t forced into awkward small talk both of us know isn’t going anywhere.
Those cute twins by the toffee apple stall, however, are worth a second look. I throw the boy a wink and he returns a heart-wrenchingly shy smile. Blessed hells, he has flowers in his hair. His sister looks as though she wants to beat the crap out of me. When I shoot her the finger guns, she clutches her hotdog so hard the sausage shoots out of the bun.
Resistance. Strength, Dee. You do not need that hotdog-wielding temptress, or her petal-soft brother. Not tonight. You’re here for a higher purpose.
That purpose is everywhere. It’s beneath my feet, in the chalk animals dancing across cobblestones. It’s overhead, in the red waves of paper kites rising into the black night. And when a man slams into me, upending his drink, it’s down my shirt, and a little in my mouth.
The Festival of the Blessing.
The twelve-day celebration marking the end of one era, and the beginning of a new one. Twelve days for the twelve provinces of the Empire of Concordia. Twelve days to celebrate the many things which make us different, and the few things which unite us.
The perfect opportunity to make headway on a simple ambition: consume every food in Concordia before I expire from presumed heart failure.
Merchants from all over Concordia have travelled to Dragon Province to sell every conceivable export. Gilded masks inlaid with Spider Province jewels sit alongside luminescent flowers plucked from Crow Province. Winged Grasshopper Province costumes flutter alongside Fish Province toy windmills. The stalls weave through the streets like a parade from a drug-induced fever dream.
Of course the festival is held in Dragon Province – Concordia’s crowning jewel and seat of Emperor Eugenios. The capital is a haven of possibilities, an eclectic hybrid of every province. The blood of the twelve is so mixed here that Dragon citizens (Dragons, for short) no longer possess the traditional green hair of their province. Their skin is a ruddy brown, and their hair a greyish-brown mix of every hue in existence. The great melting pot of the empire.
Dragons live in this dreamlike world where unity isn’t a word said in legends, but reality.
Dragons are really fucking naive.
Today the hecticness of the capital is to my advantage. It’s the only place I can slip silently out of view. Where I can dash down a narrow street into the city’s eager arms and vanish forever.
Those pesky responsibilities have my scent – Dragon Province guards in their mint-green uniforms weave through the crowd, searching the thousands of heads for the one who does not belong. Me.
