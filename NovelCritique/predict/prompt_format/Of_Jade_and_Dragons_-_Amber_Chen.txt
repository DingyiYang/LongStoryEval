Eighteen-year-old Aihui Ying dreams of becoming a world-class engineer like her father, but after his sudden murder, her life falls apart. Left with only a journal of her father’s engineering secrets and a jade pendant snatched from the assassin, a heartbroken Ying follows the trail to the capital and the prestigious Engineers Guild—a place that harbors her father’s hidden past—determined to discover why anyone would threaten a man who ultimately chose a quiet life over fame and fortune. 
Disguised as her brother, Ying manages to infiltrate the guild’s male-only apprenticeship trial with the help of an unlikely ally—Aogiya Ye-yang, the taciturn eighth prince of the High Command. With her father’s renown placing a target firmly on her back, Ying must stay one step ahead of her fellow competitors, the jealous guild masters, and the killer still hunting for her father’s journal. Complicating everything is her increasingly tangled relationship with the prince, who may have mysterious plans of his own.

### Plot Summary:
Aihui Ying infiltrates the Engineers Guild in Fei under her brother Min’s identity to uncover the truth behind her father's murder and uphold his engineering legacy. As she navigates the guild's political and academic challenges, Ying forms alliances, interferes with sinister plots, and uncovers secrets that change her perspective on the people around her. She suspects political motives behind adversaries like Master Gerel, strengthening her resolve to protect her father’s research.
Ying’s mission is complicated by her brother Wen's arrival in Fei and wars against the Great Jade Empire. At a palace banquet, Ying discovers a jade pendant tied to her father’s death, intertwined with Ye-yang, raising conflicting emotions when her sister Nian’s engagement to him is announced. Further investigations hint at imperial threats, with Ye-yang providing insights reshaping Ying's understanding of her father’s murder. His involvement intensifies Ying's resolve as she distances herself to protect her father’s legacy.
As her obsession with research grows, Ying creates potent weaponry and engages in hidden dynamics of secrecy and ambition. Her cannonball design’s success during the guild’s test garners attention and leads to a fateful audience with High Commander Aogiya Lianzhe—a man tied to her father’s past. This confrontation unveils personal betrayals and the familial ties between the High Commander and Master Lianshu.
Ying faces a critical moment of choice when the High Commander demands her father’s journal. She defies him, opting for vengeance. A tense confrontation arises, and Ye-yang betrays his father to seize power while allowing Ying to execute her retribution. After succeeding, Ying realizes she has been a pawn in Ye-yang’s calculated rise to power. Dissatisfied with this reality, she chooses to return to her roots, leaving behind the treacherous world of Fei.
In the countryside, Ying contemplates the past and her resolve to honor her father’s ideals. Despite Ye-yang’s attempts to reconcile and his promise to return, Ying decides to preserve her values, rejecting political entanglement and choosing personal integrity over ambition.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Perched at the edge of a cliff, a tiny figure watched as a dark cloud floated toward her, accompanied by the thunderous whir of rotating engine blades.
A furrow appeared on Aihui Ying’s smooth forehead.
The High Commander’s airships were far noisier than they should be. It was a low-level problem that could have been easily fixed with mufflers fashioned out of bison leather. Her father’s hypothesis was that the guild masters had let this flaw slip through on purpose, because noise was apparently an effective show of intimidation.
“Why stop there? Might as well make lightning bolts shoot out of the keel,” she muttered.
The airships passed overhead. Two smaller ones in front and two behind, guarding the behemoth in the middle. Each of them was a black monstrosity emblazoned with the silver emblem of the cobra, bamboo-battened sails extending out from both sides of the hull and flapping majestically against the cold winds.
In her childhood, Ying had once disturbed a sleeping lizard lounging on a rock to find out if it was dead. It awoke in a fury, brightly colored frills flaring from its neck in a spectacular display. That was where the Engineers Guild must have gotten their inspiration from, she reckoned, when they added those sails to the airships. Again, for intimidation more than functionality.
“By decree of the High Commander,” a monotonous voice issued from above, “the Cobra’s Order is transporting a traitorous prisoner from the capital city to the mines of Juwan, where he is to serve his sentence till death. All civilian airships, keep away—I repeat—keep away.”
Ying snorted, covering her ears with her gloved hands to shield them from the racket. Trust the High Commander to make an exhibition of his own son’s exile.
Nevertheless, she had little sympathy for the former beile and High Commander–designate. He had dug his grave by trying to incite conflict between his brothers and then having the gall to declare that he would execute everyone he deemed a threat once he assumed command. The story of his downfall had spread far and wide across the nine isles, no doubt with silent approbation by the authorities, as a warning to all who might threaten the stability of the Aogiya High Command.
Once the airships had gone by, Ying focused her attention back on the task at hand. She was losing daylight, and while the night views of the Huarin isle were magical, landing was far more challenging in the dark. She tucked loose strands of hair behind her ears, adjusting the cloth band at the back of her head to make sure her bun was secured. Inhaling the frigid summer air, she stretched her hands out to the sides.
“In Abka Han we trust.”
She leaned forward, tipping her center of gravity over the edge of the cliff. Her body hurtled downward, the distance between her and the perilous rocks rapidly shrinking.
A sprinkling of ocean spray kissed her cheeks—and she sprang to action.
