### Genres: Horror, Thriller, LGBT

### Premise:
Where beauty lies, secrets are held...ugly ones.
Sol Reyes has had a rough year. After a series of workplace incidents at her university lab culminates in a plagiarism accusation, Sol is put on probation. Dutiful visits to her homophobic father aren’t helping her mental health, and she finds her nightly glass of wine becoming more of an all-day—and all-bottle—event. Her wife, Alice Song, is far more optimistic. After all, the two finally managed to buy a house in the beautiful, gated community of Maneless Grove.
However, the neighbors are a little too friendly in Sol’s opinion. She has no interest in the pushy Homeowners Association, their bizarrely detailed contract, or their never-ending microaggressions. But Alice simply attributes their pursuit to the community “Invest in a neighborly spirit”...which only serves to irritate Sol more.  
Suddenly, a number of strange occurrences—doors and stairs disappearing, roots growing inside the house—cause Sol to wonder if her social paranoia isn’t built on something more sinister. Yet Sol’s fears are dismissed as Alice embraces their new home and becomes increasingly worried instead about Sol’s drinking and manic behavior. When Sol finds a journal in the property from a resident that went missing a few years ago, she realizes why they were able to buy the house so easily...
Through Sol’s razor-sharp tongue and macabre sense of humor, Tirado explores the very real pressures to assimilate with one’s surroundings to “survive,” while also asking the question: Is it survival when you’re no longer your true self? Because in Maneless Grove, either you become a good neighbor—or you die.

### Plot Summary:
Sol, a driven Black butch scientist, relocates with her wife Alice to the suburb of Maneless Grove, a place haunted by eerie supernatural phenomena. Their marriage strains as Alice immerses into the community’s influence and Sol grapples with career setbacks and isolation, given the suburb's sinister nuances. Sol partners with Amir, a neighbor, to probe into the disquieting lore of the "Maneless Missing" within the community. This narrative explores Sol’s internal and external struggles, clouded by efforts to unravel the community's enigmas, hindered by a workplace accident involving her rival, Dr. Clarke. Tensions escalate during community events, including Corinne’s funeral, as Sol’s premonitions further alienate Alice, who begins making autonomous choices. Sol’s distrust of the community heightens, mainly towards Nadine, amid supernatural and social pressures climaxing during a spa visit revealing hidden truths. A confrontation at Harrison’s Senior Living underscores Sol’s strained paternal bond and internal tug-of-war between personal desires and family duty.
Meanwhile, a metaphysical entity dubbed "the neighbor" offers cryptic counsel, entrenching Sol deeper in spiraling disputes. Surrounding neighbor Finnian unmasks the community’s eerie control through a connected tree network, deepening Sol’s solitude due to skepticism while Alice falls further into enchantment. Sol’s unintended role in the Grove's outreach comes to light, threatening her autonomy and marital bond. Sol navigates through metaphoric and genuine phantoms, endeavoring to uphold her identity amidst surging paranormal vexations of Maneless Grove. Sessions with Dr. Nieman offer little solace as Sol withholds pivotal details, underscoring her isolation. Alice’s behavioral transformation, fueled by the neighborhood’s chilling aura, intensifies Sol’s alarm—most notably after Alice leave her job hastily, isolating herself from family, deepening Sol’s unease.
A heartfelt dialogue with Alice underscores their waning romance under mystical manipulation, spotlighting Sol’s urgency to salvage past joys. Sol’s resolve to protect each other amidst personal trials underscores their shared history against burgeoning external and internal threats. Prepping for a community bonfire, Sol uncovers eerie phenomena at her residence, deciphering a parasitic force thriving within the community. This entity’s revelation steers Sol’s dealings to align seamlessly with its mechanism, arming her with a covert plan. During the bonfire, Sol maneuvers strategically to subtly shift perceptions, amplify her societal stance, and openly pitch her candidacy for community presidency, hinting at her intent to counteract the Grove's grip from within, retaking authority over her life to shield herself and Alice from succumbing to the community's voracious essence.
Now, settled at Havenstar Cafe, Sol balances these freshly acquired duties following her electoral win, benefitting from delegating tasks which stabilize her mental state amidst sensory overload provoked by community connections. Amir joins her, facing fuzziness induced by "the pollen," resulting in memory lapses. They humorously converse over mundane topics like Amir’s family dilemmas and Sol’s escapades concerning her father’s nursing home antics. Sol neutralized her father’s turmoil with a metaphorical gift, aligning their relationship positively. As Amir muses on a potential move, the idea of connecting with Andor’s Grove intrigues Sol, suggesting future opportunities, and subtly linking back to her established network.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
When the gates parted and the truck drove into the quiet community, Sol only had one thought: Maneless Grove was exactly like the brochure.
The houses were painted the kind of pastel yellow that didn’t attempt to assault the eyes, but also wasn’t dim enough to recall the image of an infant’s spittle. It was pleasant—a word Sol hated. Carefully manicured lawns, which barely stood taller than an inch, welcomed Sol and her wife into their new home—no, their new life.
Even the clouds parted to let down a heavenly ray of sunshine.
It was the kind of place that put the brochure to shame, actually. And that was rare. Sol’s eyes jumped from tree to passing tree. Every few feet was another one planted into the sidewalk, medium-size in thickness but nearly as tall as the homes behind it. The white bark caught her attention—she’d never seen trees like this before.
Alice reached out to grip Sol’s arm and a surge of energy jolted her.
“I can’t believe it,” Alice whispered. “We’re here.”
As Sol followed the moving truck in her own car through the community, she caught brief glimpses of the people who lived in such an impossibly perfect place. A group of middle-aged white women descended upon the sidewalk in a brisk formation, garbed in different styles of athleisure suits from the same name brand. A balding man was checking his mailbox with all the gusto of a divorcé. The truck in front of them stopped short as a self-absorbed teenager crossed the street. While the professional movers yelled from their cab, the pale teen barely noticed, too engrossed in whatever music his headphones were blaring or what was on the screen of his phone.
They moved on, and Sol held back a smug grin. As perfect as Maneless Grove looked, there was no such thing as perfect people. At least she had that to look forward to.
Alice hummed. “So . . . what do you think?”
“It’s . . . nice.” Before the distracted teen, she was actually thinking it was too nice. Like it was all a setup and any moment now, they were going to roll up to one of those prank camera crews that was going to livestream their reaction to the distressing news they didn’t actually buy a house but rather a landfill or an abandoned penitentiary.
Okay, that’s never happened in the history of the world. But Sol’s imagination ran on the premise that if anything bad could happen, it would happen to her. Good things weren’t just good things—they were an omen, a warning that the other shoe would drop soon.
From the corner of her eye, Sol watched Alice give a curt nod. The gesture annoyed her, but she bit the inside of her cheek to keep from snapping.
