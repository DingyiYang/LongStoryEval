### Genres: Mystery, Thriller, Horror

### Premise:
In scenic Granite Harbor, life has continued on―quiet and serene―for decades. That is until a local teenager is found brutally murdered in the Settlement, the town’s historic archaeological site. Alex Brangwen, adjusting to life as a single father with a failed career as a novelist, is the town’s sole detective. This is his first murder case and, as both a parent and detective, Alex knows the people of Granite Harbor are looking to him to catch the killer and temper the fear that has descended over the town.
Isabel, a single mother attempting to support her family while healing from her own demons, finds herself in the middle of the case when she begins working at the Settlement. Her son, Ethan, and Alex’s daughter, Sophie, were best friends with the victim. When a second body is found, both parents are terrified that their child may be next. As Alex and Isabel race to find the killer in their midst, the town’s secrets―past and present―begin bubbling to the surface, threatening to unravel the tight-knit community.
At once a page-turning thriller and a captivating portrait of the social fabric of a small town, Granite Harbor evokes the atmosphere of HBO’s Mare of Easttown with a villain reminiscent of Thomas Harris’s Silence of the Lambs.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The air was frigid, condensing Isabel’s breath into plumes above her face. It was October and she was no closer to being able to pay for a new furnace than when it had died in August. She had to throw the thought aside like the down comforter as she jumped out of bed, turned on the space heater in her bathroom, and went downstairs to let the dog out.
Back upstairs, with no hot water, she used a washcloth at the sink. Then she began to dress.
She’d laid out her costume the night before. Roger Priestly had given her a photocopied illustration showing the name and arrangement of each particular layer: linen shift (over her own cotton underpants and L.L. Bean sports bra), large-weave woolen hose stockings, petticoat, free-hanging pockets of some rugged burlap material fastened around the waist like empty udders beneath outer layers, front-lacing bodice, thick homespun woolen dress, apron, cape, and the linen “coif,” shaped like a loose-fitting bathing cap. Finally, those awful shoes, like black orthopedic clogs with a large ornamental buckle—pirate shoes from some Disney cartoon. All of it purchased for her from a theatrical costume house in Boston.
Good lord, Isabel thought, looking at Goodwife Swaine in the tall bedroom mirror. You poor woman! You milk cows, chop wood, nurse infants, churn butter, slaughter pigs, chickens, God knows what else, cook over an open fire, and entertain your husband … in this getup?
At least she felt warm.
Ethan was still asleep as she passed his bedroom door and negotiated the narrow staircase with her voluminous layers, making a noise as if she were dragging a canvas tent down the stairs.
When she opened the door to let the dog back in, Flynn barked at her and stepped backward.
“Quiet, Flynn! Come inside.”
Warily, the dog edged in, giving her a wide berth. He looked at her and growled.
“Oh shush. It’s just me. Now lie down in your bed.” Isabel pointed.
A high-strung Australian shepherd, Flynn had difficulty with change, surprises. He slunk to his bed in a corner of the kitchen and lay down.
Now the house was still. No noise—not even the rumbling of a furnace in the basement. She’d never noticed the sound until it had stopped. No shouting—one of the mercies of the new regime of Ethan’s “unschooling.” Her doubts at pulling him out of school allayed for now by the extraordinary peace in the house every morning. Ethan had stopped throwing up from stress before slouching off to the bus with that insanely overloaded backpack. She should have done this five years ago. Or maybe from the beginning. He knew everything anyway. And he had his ships to build.
She grabbed her mug and pushed herself and her outfit out the kitchen door.
