### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
THE UNEARTHING
April 2023
A steady rain falls as Benjamin and Raphael Duvalier work their excavator alongside a dark lake on the misted flanks of Hemlock Mountain. The brothers are digging up the concrete foundations of an old and tiny wooden A-frame chapel. The chapel is located at the Hemlock Ski Resort area base and is being moved higher into the alpine to make way for an expansion. It’s barely dawn, and the temperature hovers around freezing. Behind them the forest creeps down the mountain and wraiths of mist finger between the trees. Empty lift chairs hang motionless on cables that disappear into the low clouds.
Benjamin claps his gloved hands together, trying to get blood to flow into his frozen fingers. This wet cold is far worse than dryer temperatures well below freezing. His brother is at least warmer inside the excavator cab. Raphael pulls the hydraulic control and scoops up another load of concrete and damp earth. He swivels the bucket out over the bed of a waiting truck and dumps its contents inside. The big vehicle sinks a little under the fresh weight.
Using the back of his glove, Benjamin swipes rain from his face and then points to the ground, showing his brother where to dig next. The excavator bucket swings back. Raphael moves the lever. The bucket lowers to the ground, and the teeth dig into black soil. He moves his controls again and begins to scoop.
The bucket’s teeth hook something and jerk it free of the earth. Benjamin’s heart jumps. He hurriedly steps forward in an effort to process what he’s seeing.
“Whoa! Whoa. Stop!” he screams, shooting his hand into the air and making a slicing motion across his neck.
Raphael halts the excavator arm. He hops down from the cab and runs over to where Benjamin has crouched. Benjamin carefully brushes damp soil off the long object that has been pulled up in the dirt. His heart hammers. He glances at Raphael.
They have hooked two big, long bones.
Benjamin knows they are not from a large animal because the thing hanging off the end of them is a boot.
A woman’s boot with a platform heel.
JANE
Sergeant Jane Munro forces herself to concentrate on the words coming out the mouth of the emaciated blonde seated across from her in the church basement semicircle.
“I’m exhausted,” the woman laments. “To the core of my bones. All. Of. The. Time.”
Her name is Stephanie. She’s a mom. Or was. What do you call a mother whose child is missing, simply gone?
