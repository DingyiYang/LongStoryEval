### Plot Summary:
Emily Allen transitions from her life in Martha’s Vineyard to begin anew in Finn’s Hollow, Ireland, where she works as an assistant to the renowned author Siobhan Riordan. Initially there to assist Siobhan in completing the last book of the beloved Tig McMorrow series, Emily gradually becomes a pivotal figure within both the Riordan family and the wider community. Throughout this period, Siobhan grapples with terminal cancer, a fact she initially conceals, driven by her determination to finish her literary work. The story arc navigates the nuances of unspoken truths and eventual revelations.
As Emily becomes deeply entrenched in this journey, her relationship with Siobhan's son, Kier, transitions from professional tension to a profound romantic bond. This growing relationship is tested when Kier feels betrayed upon discovering that Emily was aware of Siobhan’s illness before him, causing a temporary rift. Nevertheless, Emily's commitment to the family and her bond with Siobhan remains steadfast, amidst her own heartbreak, as she continues to contribute meaningfully to Siobhan's work and legacy.
Siobhan assumes a maternal role for Emily, leaving an indelible mark on her life, as seen through heartfelt and shared experiences. The completion of the manuscript stands as a bittersweet accomplishment against the backdrop of impending loss. Siobhan’s passing is marked by significant communal support, the village rallying to honor her life and literary contribution, with a wake and funeral reflecting her enduring legacy of kindness.
A turning point arises when Sloane Ryder, Siobhan’s longtime editor, offers Emily a potential role as an editor in Dublin, further validating her editorial prowess. As Emily contemplates this opportunity, her future appears uncertain amidst the emotional chaos of Siobhan’s death and unresolved feelings with Kier. Supported by friends Sam and Ben, Emily explores her own path in Dublin, temporarily distancing herself from Kier.
However, Kier, amidst personal turmoil and self-reflection, makes a defining gesture by traveling to Dublin, echoing gestures from literature in his confession of love and remorse, revealing his inability to let Emily go. Emily, moved by his vulnerability and sincerity, accepts Kier’s apology, reaffirming their love and solidifying their commitment to each other. Her acceptance of the remote editing position signifies a dual commitment to both her career and shared life with Kier within Finn’s Hollow.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“Em, are you all right?” Samantha Gale, my very best friend, answered her phone on the fourth ring. Her voice was rough with sleep and it belatedly occurred to me that nine o’clock in the morning in Finn’s Hollow, Ireland, was four o’clock in the morning in Oak Bluffs, Martha’s Vineyard.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Damn it, I woke you up, didn’t I?” I asked, feeling awful about it.
“No, it’s fine,” Sam said. “I told you when you left that I’m always here for you.” There was a low grumbling in the background and she added, “And Ben says he’s here for you, too.”
That made me laugh. Sam and Ben had become couple goals for me. Not that I thought I’d ever find anything like the connection they’d made, but they kept the pilot light of my innermost hope aflame.
“Thank you and Ben,” I said. “I’m going to hang up now. Forget I ever called.”
“Emily Allen, don’t you dare,” Sam said. Now she sounded fully awake. Oops.
“No, really I—” I began but she interrupted me.
“Tell me why you’re calling, otherwise I’ll worry.” There was more grumbling in the background. Sam laughed and said, “Ben says he’s begging you to tell me so that I don’t drive him crazy with speculation.”
I grinned. She would, too. Then I grew serious.
Glancing around the Last Chapter, the quaint bookshop in which I was presently standing, I noted objectively that it was a booklover’s dream come true. A three-story stone building chock-full of books with a small café, where the scent of fresh-brewed coffee, berry-filled scones, and cinnamon pastry permeated the air. I felt myself lean in that direction as if the delicious aromas were reeling me in.
One of the employees had unlocked the front door of the shop, and I had trailed in behind a handful of customers who’d been waiting. I’d been agog ever since.
This was it. The bookshop where I’d be working for the next year. My heart was pounding and my palms were sweaty. The black wool turtleneck sweater I was wearing, in an attempt to defeat the early November chill, felt as if it were choking me and I was quite sure the pain spearing through my head meant I was having an aneurysm.
“I’m supposed to meet my boss in a few minutes, and I think I’m having a heart attack or potentially a stroke,” I said.
There was a beat of silence then Sam said, “Tell me your symptoms.”
I listed them all and she noted each one with an “uh-huh,” which told me nothing whatsoever as to what she thought about my condition. I was three thousand miles away and starting a new job in a bookshop, having put my career as a librarian on Martha’s Vineyard on hold to chase some crazy fantasy where I traveled to a foreign destination and lived a life full of adventure.
“I think I’m going to throw up,” I groaned.
