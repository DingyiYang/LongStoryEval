### Title: Middle of the Night

### Genres: Thriller, Mystery, Mystery Thriller

### Premise:
The worst thing to ever happen on Hemlock Circle occurred in Ethan Marsh’s backyard. One July night, ten-year-old Ethan and his best friend and neighbor, Billy, fell asleep in a tent set up on a manicured lawn in a quiet, quaint New Jersey cul de sac. In the morning, Ethan woke up alone. During the night, someone had sliced the tent open with a knife and taken Billy. He was never seen again.
Thirty years later, Ethan has reluctantly returned to his childhood home. Plagued by bad dreams and insomnia, he begins to notice strange things happening in the middle of the night. Someone seems to be roaming the cul de sac at odd hours, and signs of Billy’s presence keep appearing in Ethan’s backyard. Is someone playing a cruel prank? Or has Billy, long thought to be dead, somehow returned to Hemlock Circle?
The mysterious occurrences prompt Ethan to investigate what really happened that night, a quest that reunites him with former friends and neighbors and leads him into the woods that surround Hemlock Circle. Woods where Billy claimed monsters roamed and where a mysterious institute does clandestine research on a crumbling estate. 
The closer Ethan gets to the truth, the more he realizes that no place—be it quiet forest or suburban street—is completely safe. And that the past has a way of haunting the present.

### Plot Summary:
In "Hemlock Circle," Ethan Marsh revisits traumatic memories of his childhood associated with the mysterious disappearance and subsequent death of his friend Billy Barringer in 1994. The story unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between past memories of life in the Hemlock Circle neighborhood and the present-day effort to uncover the truth about Billy’s fate. Together with Detective Cassandra Palmer and his friend Ragesh Patel, Ethan embarks on a quest to solve Billy's cold case, confronting buried emotions, community secrets, and ghosts from his past.
As children, Ethan, Billy, and their friends, including Russ Chen, were drawn to the paranormal lore surrounding the nearby Hawthorne Institute. Billy's obsession with these supernatural elements caused friction and cast suspicion within the friend group. As an adult, Ethan is determined to revive the cold case, challenging the Hemlock Circle residents' silence and introspecting amidst personal grief, including the death of his wife, Claudia. Reenacting events of that fateful night, Ethan sets up the tent in his childhood backyard, triggering memories and unveiling layers of guilt attached to Russ's actions, who had cut the tent in envy.
The investigation leads to dismantling community facades, exposing shared trauma and guilt. Ethan's pursuit of understanding is compounded by the return of Andy Barringer, Billy’s brother. The confrontation at Hawthorne Falls—a site symbolic of past tragedies—yields Ashley’s accidental confession. She admits to hitting Billy while driving intoxicated, mistakenly thinking she had struck an animal. The layered narrative explores implications of guilt, fear, and protection over family from an accidental misstep resulting in Billy's concealed death.
The climax of Ethan’s journey towards closure leads to a rescue event at Hawthorne Falls: Ethan saves Henry, Ashley’s son, from drowning in the same waters where Billy was hidden. The encounter hints at supernatural intervention, providing Ethan an encounter suggesting Billy's enduring spectral presence.
The epilogue captures the aftermath, occurring eighteen months later. As New Year's Eve arrives, Ethan contemplates the transformation of Hemlock Circle. Many original residents, burdened by the community’s past, have moved away, making room for new families. Despite personal trauma, Ethan finds solace in his evolving role as father to Henry, Ashley’s son, whom he legally adopts after Ashley's imprisonment for Billy's accidental death. New connections forge in Hemlock Circle, indicated by Henry's blossoming friendships and Ethan's potential new relationship.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Scriiiiiiiitch.
I wake with a start, unnerved by the sound zipping across the dark room. It echoes off the walls and snakes back to me in multiple waves. I lie in bed, completely still, eyes wide open, until the noise fades.
Not that it was ever there to begin with.
Decades of experience have taught me that it was just in my head. Dream, memory, and hallucination all at once. My first since coming back to this house. Honestly, I’m surprised it took so long, especially with the anniversary of what happened here fast approaching.
Sitting up, I look to the clock on the nightstand, hoping it reads closer to dawn than midnight. No such luck. It’s only quarter after two. I’ve got a long night of no sleep ahead of me. With a sigh, I reach for the notebook and pen I keep next to the clock. After much squinting in the darkness, I find a fresh page and scribble four frustrating words.
Had The Dream again.
I toss the notebook back onto the nightstand, followed by the pen. It lands with a clack against the notebook’s cover before rolling onto the carpet. I tell myself to leave the pen there until morning. That nothing will happen to it overnight. But the bad thoughts arrive quickly. What if the pen leaks, its midnight-black ink staining the cream-colored carpet? What if I’m attacked in the middle of the night and the only thing I can use to defend myself is an uncapped Bic, which now sits out of reach?
That second one, as alarming as it is improbable, pulls me out of bed. I grab the pen and set it on the notebook. There. Much better.
Anxiety soothed—for now—I’m about to crawl back under the covers when something outside catches my attention.
A light.
Not unusual for Hemlock Circle. Despite the lack of streetlights, it’s never completely dark here. Light spills through bay windows onto immaculate front lawns and brightens second-floor bedrooms before the sun rises and long after it sets. The sconces flanking the Chens’ front door burn from dusk to dawn, warding off both trespassers and the bats that occasionally try to roost in the eaves. All summer long, the Wallaces’ backyard pool glows an alien blue. At Christmas, lights twinkle at five of the six homes in the neighborhood, including the Patels’, who put theirs up at Diwali and don’t take them down until a new year begins.
Then there are the garage lights.
Every house has them.
A pair of motion-activated security lights centered above the garage doors that glare like headlights when triggered. In the evenings, they flick on and off around the cul-de-sac with the frequency of fireflies as residents return from work in the waning light, go out to fetch the mail, haul recycling bins to the curb.
