### Premise:
It’s like I keep stumbling into a dark room, searching for the switch to make things bright again. To make me remember. But the switch isn’t there. Was it there before?
Sade Hussein is starting her third year of high school, this time at the prestigious Alfred Nobel Academy boarding school. After being home-schooled all her life and feeling like a magnet for misfortune, she’s not sure what will happen. What she doesn’t expect though is for her roommate Elizabeth to disappear after Sade’s first night. Or for people to think she had something to do with it.
With rumors swirling around her, Sade catches the attention of the most popular girls in school – collectively known as the ‘Unholy Trinity’ – and they bring her into their fold. Between learning more about them - especially Persephone, who Sade finds herself drawn to - playing catch-up in class, and trying to figure out what happened to Elizabeth, Sade has a lot on her plate. It doesn’t help that she’s already dealing with grief from the many tragedies in her family.
And then a student is found dead.
The more Sade investigates, the more she realizes there’s more to Alfred Nobel Academy and its students than she realized. Secrets lurk around every corner and beneath every surface...secrets that rival even her own.

### Plot Summary:
At Alfred Nobel Academy (ANA), a series of events unfolds surrounding a group called the Fishermen, known for their toxic culture and abuse. Elizabeth Wang, a victim of this group, seeks justice after being assaulted by Jude Ripley and coerced by August Owens. Her efforts to report the incidents are dismissed by the apathetic Headmaster Webber. Driven by the need for justice, Elizabeth, with the help of her ally Sade, investigates the Fishermen to expose their crimes. After surviving a life-threatening altercation involving Jude and August, Elizabeth is saved by April Owens, whose loyalties are torn between the Fishermen and her conscience.
Concurrently, Sade, alongside Persephone and Baz, launches a website to let students anonymously share their experiences, challenging the school's authority and drawing wider attention to the issue. April confesses to Jude's murder, claiming it was to protect her boyfriend, Francis. Sade confronts April, unveiling layers of manipulation within their group. Francis confesses his part in the affair, expressing remorse yet prioritizing the protection of April. The school's response to the scandal is insufficient, only offering superficial measures against bullying.
Elizabeth decides to leave ANA to start anew after her traumatic experiences. Before leaving, she shares a touching moment with Baz and Sade, who continue their fight against the injustices at the academy. During an assembly, Headmaster Webber announces Sade's expulsion for her involvement with the website. Despite the initial shock, Sade receives support from her friends, Persephone and Baz. Shortly before leaving, she learns her expulsion is under review by the board after Webber is replaced by a more supportive headmaster, Ms. Laurens.
Fast forward a year, and much has changed. Ana is led by the newer headmaster, focusing on students' well-being and holding guilty Fishermen accountable, although some systemic issues remain. Sade decides to stay at ANA, continuing her studies, and enjoying life as part of the school's swim team and in a relationship with Persephone. While she still grapples with her trauma and dreams of her late sister, Sade finds strength and happiness in her friendships and new experiences, concluding her journey with a renewed sense of hope and belonging.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):

Sade Hussein was used to being lied to.
When she was seven, she was told that the woman she saw sneaking out of her father’s room early in the morning was the tooth fairy and definitely not her nanny. When she was ten and she found her mother slumped back in the bathtub, unmoving, with a bottle of pills resting on the ledge – she was told that her mother was taking a very long nap and would wake soon. When she was fourteen, she begged her father to let her go to a normal school and make friends with real kids her age, instead of her only real friend being her maths tutor, who let her sleep during class sometimes. She was told by her father that high school wasn’t what it seemed. That it was the furthest from the magic that the movies had led her to believe.
But as the black town car pulled into the gates of Alfred Nobel Academy and the giant castle-like boarding school came into view, neither the rain nor the memory of her father’s warning could dull her excitement.
The school looked like a palace.
The brownstone walls, fancy peaks and crisp greenery near the front that seemed to stretch on for miles had captured her attention entirely. Even the driver’s eyes widened at the sight of the enormous building, a far cry from the narrow town house in which she grew up.
A knock on the window pulled them both out of their trance as a man wearing a security uniform leaned over the car.
Sade wound her window down.
“Name and purpose?” the security guy asked her.
“Sade Hussein, student,” she said, and followed up quickly with, “It’s my first day.”
He nodded, then muttered something into his walkie-talkie. “All right. You can go on up, there should be someone waiting for you by the entrance,” he told her.
“Thank you,” she replied.
The car continued along the path, and Sade tried to take in more of the school surroundings.
Perfectly trimmed rosebushes, evenly cut grass, and wild cherry trees. In the distance she could see rows of beautiful buildings. Old and new.
“I think this is as far as I can go,” the driver said, the car coming to a stop in front of the main building.
“How much is that?” she asked.
The driver looked at her through the rear-view mirror. “It’s covered, compliments of your father,” he said, the last part uttered quickly in a hushed tone, as though just the thought of him could raise the dead.
It was strange how even from beyond the grave, her father still had that effect on people.
It was as though people didn’t truly believe he was gone.
The great Akin Hussein, bested by his very own heart. It didn’t seem real.
She didn’t blame them either – even she felt his presence still looming. Watching her every move like he had always done.
