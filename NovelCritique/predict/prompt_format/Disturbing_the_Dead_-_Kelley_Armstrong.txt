### Title: Disturbing the Dead

### Genres: Mystery, Time Travel, Historical Fiction

### Premise:
Victorian Scotland is becoming less strange to modern-day homicide detective Mallory Atkinson. Though inhabiting someone else’s body will always be unsettling, even if her employers know that she’s not actually housemaid Catriona Mitchell, ever since the night both of them were attacked in the same dark alley 150 years apart. Mallory likes her job as assistant to undertaker/medical examiner Dr. Duncan Gray, and is developing true friends―and feelings―in this century.
So, understanding the Victorian fascination with death, Mallory isn't that surprised when she and her friends are invited to a mummy unwrapping at the home of Sir Alastair Christie. When their host is missing when it comes time to unwrap the mummy, Gray and Mallory are asked to step in. And upon closer inspection, it’s not a mummy they’ve unwrapped, but a much more modern body.

### Plot Summary:
Mallory Atkinson, a modern detective, suddenly finds herself in 1869 Edinburgh, inhabiting the body of Victorian maid Catriona Mitchell. Adjusting to this new reality, she retains her detective prowess, helping forensic consultant Dr. Duncan Gray solve the murder of Sir Alastair Christie. Initial suspicions fall on Lord Muir, tangled with artifact theft and mummified remains from Egypt.
In the midst of Victorian society's constraints, Mallory partners with Gray, examining various leads. Florence King, a female medical student with ties to the mummy, becomes a focus after her husband Emmett’s misconduct surfaces. The couple's strained relationship is colored by domestic abuse and Emmett's desperation to succeed, leading to his entanglement in murder under Muir's manipulation.
As they connect the dots, Mallory takes a brief return to her time, drawing support from her grandmother before reaffirming her commitment to the historical investigation. Returning, she and Gray delve deeper into Emmett and Florence's lives, uncovering a cheating scandal and Emmett’s potential motives for murder.
Mallory and Gray's scrutiny of Emmett reveals a plot to steal exam questions. During a critical confrontation at the Kings’ residence, they find domestic abuse evidence, unveiling Emmett's violent tendencies. Their efforts are hampered by Lorna, a maid secretly working for writer Joseph McBride to sensationalize Gray's investigations.
Their quest heightens as they track Florence’s troubled path, shadowed by Muir’s malevolent interest. Following footprints and trails, they stumble into an underground trap set by Muir, who seeks to eliminate Florence for her dangerous knowledge about his schemes. In the tense standoff, Mallory and Gray liberate Florence, exposing Emmett’s coercion by Muir.
With Inspector McCreadie’s help, Muir is arrested, but Florence faces emotional turmoil from her husband's betrayal and criminality. McBride’s once tantalizing serialized tales transition into unwanted attention for them all, reinforcing Gray's growing reputation in the justice system.
The epilogue reveals the denouement: Emmett's pending trial and new prospects for Florence as she considers a future in America. Lorna’s dismissal pushes Jack, who aided Mallory, into the role of housemaid to gain insight for chronicling authentic stories of Mallory and Gray’s exploits. Mallory’s reassurance arrives with the disappearance of letters she left for her parents, affirming their communication across time. Meanwhile, Gray supports Mallory’s choice to reside in the past with the gift of a pistol for her protection, solidifying her position in this historical setting and pointing toward the possibility of more adventures.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“What are your feelings on mummies?”
I look across the drawing-room table at Annis. We’re in the middle of a brutal game of cards. Sure, I suspect “cards” and “brutal” should never be used in the same sentence, but this is Annis, who could turn Go Fish into a blood sport.
This particular game is écarté, which is similar to whist, except it’s for two people. While playing a card game with my boss’s sister might seem like a reprieve from my housemaid chores, it’s actually the opposite, because those chores aren’t going anywhere. This just means I’ll be stuck folding the damn laundry after I should be done with work and chilling.
But what Annis wants, Annis gets, and if she demands I play cards with her, I don’t have much choice. Okay, yes, I could refuse. After all, I’m not really a housemaid in 1869 Edinburgh. I’m a twenty-first-century police detective who is—for reasons the universe refuses to divulge—trapped in the body of Dr. Duncan Gray’s twenty-year-old housemaid.
Gray knows my story. His other sister, Isla, knows it. But they’re not here, having abandoned me for some secret mission that I’m not pissy about at all. I’m stuck with Annis, who doesn’t know my secret, and if I tell her that entertaining unannounced guests isn’t my job? Well, that isn’t something a Victorian housemaid tells a dowager countess.
So I’m playing écarté, and she’s slaughtering me, despite the fact that I’ve actually been getting good at this game. No one plays like Annis. At least the bloodshed is only figurative. This time.
“Mummies?” She waves a hand in front of my face. “Are you listening to me, Mallory?”
“What are my … feelings? On … mummies?”
“Have you been nipping whisky while my sister is out? That might explain this.” She waves at the cards. “The only other explanation is that you feel obligated to let me win. I expected better of you.”
I ignore the jabs. With Annis, you choose your battles, or you won’t stop fighting until you drop of exhaustion and she declares herself victor.
“I fear, Lady Annis, that I am a poor substitute for Dr. Gray and Mrs. Ballantyne. I do not travel in the proper social circles, and while I am certain there is some custom where one stops in the midst of a card game to ask one’s partner’s feelings on mummies, I do not know the appropriate response. Please forgive me. I am such a dunce.”
Her eyes narrow. “No, you are rude, disrespectful, and sarcastic. Fortunately for you, I find those all admirable qualities in a young woman, so long as she is not my maid. Now, mummies. Your feelings on mummies.”
“You are talking about Egyptian mummies, yes? This isn’t some secret code among the nobility, where ‘mummies’ really means ‘morphine’? I have strong feelings on morphine. It is bad. Don’t take it. There, now, I want to discard these.” I slap down two cards.
