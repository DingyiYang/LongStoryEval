### Title: The Stars Too Fondly

### Genres: Science Fiction, Romance, LGBT

### Premise:
So, here’s the thing: Cleo and her friends really, truly didn’t mean to steal this spaceship. They just wanted to know why, twenty years ago, the entire Providence crew vanished without a trace, but then the stupid dark-matter engine started on its own. Now these four twenty-somethings are en route to Proxima Centauri and unable to turn around while being harangued by a hologram that has the face and snide attitude of the ship’s missing captain, Billie. 
Cleo has dreamt of being an astronaut all her life, and Earth is a lost cause at this point, so this should be one of those blessings in disguise that people talk about. But as the ship travels deeper into space, the laws of physics start twisting; old mysteries come crawling back to life; and Cleo’s initially combative relationship with Billie turns into something deeper and more desperate than either woman was prepared for.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Twenty-seven years of obsessive amateur research had not prepared Cleo McQueary for how simple it was to break into the Erebus             Industries compound. She’d seen the exclusive news reports, the official behind-the-scenes TikToks, the infamous photos of             impassive security officers restraining bereaved family members at the compound gate—Cleo knew that this place had been crawling             with guards and dripping with unbreakable security measures, once. But now, the only thing protecting each spiraling level             of the circular compound was a dusty steel door, locked by a decades-old retinal scanner and a series of cascade ciphers.             Cleo could have cracked them all in her sleep, which was a shame—she liked a challenge.
“Well,” she said, punching the last sequence into the last keypad and thinking that the rare excuse to wear fingerless gloves             with her most practical pair of coveralls almost made up for the disappointment, “there’s no turning back now.”
“Corny,” Kaleisha whispered behind her, also looking incredibly heist-chic in her black dress and leather jacket, locs tied             back in a ponytail and killer green eyeliner standing out against her dark skin. Cleo stuck her tongue out. Thanks to Erebus             Industries’ bankruptcy, they were the first people to walk through these long-abandoned doors in a decade; a little melodrama             was absolutely warranted.
Abe fidgeted with the straps of the backpack he’d meticulously packed with things they might need (Band-Aids) and things they             definitely wouldn’t (Kaleisha’s tarot cards). He was Chinese American, tall enough to rest his chin on the top of Cleo’s head,             and bouncing on the balls of his feet so rapidly that his floppy black hair was getting in his eyes.
“Actually,” he whispered a little too loudly, “I think this would be the perfect time to turn back, if we wanted to.”
