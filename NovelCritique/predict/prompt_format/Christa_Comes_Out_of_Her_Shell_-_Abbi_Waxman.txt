After a tumultuous childhood, Christa Liddle has hidden away, both figuratively and literally.

The world goes wild, fascinated by this real-life saga, pinning Christa and her family under the spotlight. As if that weren’t enough, her reunion with an old childhood friend reveals an intense physical attraction neither was expecting and both want to act on . . . if they can just keep a lid on it.

### Plot Summary:
Dr. Christa Liddle’s life takes tumultuous turns when her father, Jasper Liddle—a renowned but supposedly deceased TV naturalist—unexpectedly resurfaces after 25 years. His arrival throws both the media and family dynamics into turmoil, forcing Christa, a dedicated marine scientist, into the public eye. As family secrets unravel and Jasper’s questionable past emerges, Christa is pressured to engage in public events to support their ecological foundation. Amid familial chaos and looming financial strain, her father suggests leveraging Christa’s involvement in a TV special for funding, further complicating her life under the spotlight.
In this period of upheaval, Nathan Donovan, a long-time family friend, becomes Christa’s emotional refuge. Their blossoming romance offers Christa much-needed stability amidst the crisis. Christa seeks guidance from Charlotte Young concerning public personas and grapples with intricate family relationships through conversations with her mother. Journalist Alex Dutton’s insinuations about Jasper’s secretive history cause emotional turmoil as Christa reconciles these revelations with her public and private life.
The media frenzy intensifies with disclosures of Jasper’s past affair and orchestrated disappearance. The scandal peaks at the Santa Monica Pier, where Christa, determined to protect her family's reputation, takes a bold stand against manipulative agent Davis Reed. With family support, she manages to dismantle his threats and assert herself publicly, embracing her identity and the realities of her family’s past. Despite Davis’s attempts to control the narrative, public sympathy shifts, enabling Jasper to regain favor. Yet, Christa recognizes society’s preference for entertainment over truth, resolving to forge her path beyond her father’s renown, guided by her principles and Nate’s support.
In the epilogue, as Christa departs for her marine research in Violetta, she and Nate, facing a painful separation, vow to maintain their connection long-distance. Upon returning to Violetta, Christa rediscovers her rhythm amidst challenges from stormy weather to island conflicts, staying in touch with Nate through heartfelt emails. Their correspondence is rich with longing and mutual support, with Nate expressing relief at stepping back from professional responsibilities to focus on his future with Christa. Unexpectedly, Nate surprises Christa by visiting Violetta, leading to a joyous anticipated reunion that hints at their enduring partnership and shared future.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
SOOTY TERN
ONYCHOPRION FUSCATUS
So, I’m going to kick off by making one thing very clear: None of this was my fault. I was part of it, sure, but only like a flea is part of a cat. I was carried along, contributing my own pain-in-the-ass factor, no argument there, but I was not, in any sense, driving the bus. Let’s not forget that when this story starts, I was literally on an island in the middle of nowhere. Hands full, head busy, heart well guarded. Safe as houses, baby.
Wait, that’s not completely accurate. The island of Violetta isn’t in the middle of nowhere; it’s slightly to the right of Africa, many hundreds of miles into the Indian Ocean. It’s a geographical, political and sociological anomaly. It’s also home to a frozen vodka drink called the Barrier Island, beyond which no man may safely travel, but that’s a sidenote. It lies two days’ sail from a large French-speaking island more than five hundred miles off the east African coast, which is probably why the French didn’t bother to claim it. It was ignored by the Mauritians, because they thought the French already nabbed it, and blithely disregarded by the British, who had no idea who owned it, but had no reason to think it was them.
No one paid much attention to it at all until the 1950s, when an enterprising young Violettan by the name of Agnes Bottlebrush did a school project on the even younger United Nations and then quietly applied for membership for Violetta (Agnes was an overachiever with time on her hands). As the result of a series of fortunate and slightly comedic events, Violetta became the smallest member of the United Nations, and Agnes received a rapid promotion to Head Girl. Then she walked around to everyone’s houses and handed them a copy of the UN Charter and gathered suggestions for what to put on the flag.
Agnes’s successful endeavors attracted the notice of the BBC, and they sent a camera crew, along with a reporter who’d been the quickest to raise his hand when asked, “Who wants to spend two weeks on a sunny island in the middle of nowhere?” (In a strange but not wholly unprecedented turn of events,1 that journalist’s son married Agnes Bottlebrush’s daughter several decades later, proving something about destiny, or karma, or the importance of follow-up when it comes to good journalism.) Bear with me; there may be a test later.2
The capital of Violetta, such as it is, is also called Violetta, and has a population of around two thousand, of which several hundred are visiting scientists of all kinds. Why, you may ask, are so many drawn so far for so little? Well, it all goes back to the island’s anomalous nature and fortuitous location.
