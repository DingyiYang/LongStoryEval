### Plot Summary:
The narrative primarily follows Cherry Lockwood, a retired actuary dubbed "the Death Lady," as she navigates the merging worlds of mathematical probability and mystical premonitions. This complex journey unfolds against the backdrop of Cherry's intense grief following the death of her husband, Ned. Cherry’s inadvertent predictions during a distressing airplane incident bring her unwanted fame, leading to a mixture of admiration and skepticism from those affected by her prophetic tendencies.
Cherry's narrative expands to include the lives she unintentionally influences. Ethan is among those affected by Cherry’s predictions, transforming his near-death experience into an appreciation for life, instigated by newfound insights encountered at Opera Bar. Meanwhile, Eve and her husband, Dom, are motivated by Cherry’s foresight to make life-altering decisions, relocating to stabilize financially while managing Dom's sleepwalking challenges.
Another character, Allegra, escapes the grim fate Cherry had predicted, embracing the irony as a sign of unexpected protection. Her narrative evolves through familial and relational dynamics reshaped by Cherry’s predictions, prompting a more constructive outlook on her aspirations.
Courage defines Paula’s journey, driven by fears for her son’s safety amidst Cherry’s uncanny insights. Her story weaves through intergenerational patterns and shared destinies, presenting a realignment toward logical analysis and grounded optimism.
Concurrently, Cherry, facing the pressures of public intrigue, gradually rebuilds her life from grief to acceptance alongside her friend Mira. This supportive companionship fosters Cherry's progress toward equilibrium, tempered by shared losses and mutual understanding. Through interactions with Mira, Ivy, and Bridie, Cherry embarks on a transformational path, deriving strength from these bonds while reevaluating her views on destiny and life's connected experiences.
The epilogue branches out to introduce Timothy Binici, a young Olympic hopeful emerging as a testament to fate and human resilience. His story connects back to the central motif of prophecy and defying odds—a theme resonant throughout Cherry’s journey as well. Timmy’s near-tragedy and consequent professional success underscore the complex dance between foreseen destinies and self-determined paths.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Later, not a single person will recall seeing the lady board the flight at Hobart Airport.
Nothing about her appearance or demeanor raises a red flag or even an eyebrow.
She is not drunk or belligerent or famous.
She is not injured, like the bespectacled hipster with his arm scaffolded in white gauze so that one hand is permanently pressed to his heart, as if he’s professing his love or honesty.
She is not frazzled, like the sweaty young mother trying to keep her grip on a slippery baby, a furious toddler, and far too much carry-on.
She is not frail, like the stooped elderly couple wearing multiple heavy layers as if they’re off to join Captain Scott’s Antarctic expedition.
She is not grumpy, like the various middle-aged people with various middle-aged things on their minds, or the flight’s only unaccompanied minor: a six-year-old forced to miss his friend’s laser-tag party because his parents’ shared custody agreement requires him to be on this flight to Sydney every Friday afternoon.
She is not chatty, like the couple so eager to share details of their holiday you can’t help but wonder if they’re working undercover for a Tasmanian state government tourism initiative.
She is not extremely pregnant like the extremely pregnant woman.
She is not extremely tall like the extremely tall guy.
She is not quivery from fear of flying or espresso or amphetamines (let’s hope not) like the jittery teen wearing an oversized hoodie over very short shorts that makes it look like she’s not wearing any pants, and someone says she’s that singer dating that actor, but someone else says no, that’s not her, I know who you mean, but that’s not her.
She is not shiny-eyed like the shiny-eyed honeymooners flying to Sydney still in their lavish bridal clothes, those crazy kids, leaving ripples of goodwill in their wake, and even eliciting a reckless offer from a couple to give up their business-class seats, which the bride and groom politely but firmly refuse, much to the couple’s relief.
The lady is not anything that anyone will later recall.
At least it’s not canceled. “Yet,” say the pessimists.
The PA crackles an announcement: Passengers requiring special assistance are invited to board.
“Told you so!” The optimists jump to their feet and sling bags over their shoulders.
While boarding, the lady does not stop to tap the side of the plane once, twice, three times for luck, or to flirt with a flight attendant, or to swipe frantically at her phone screen because her boarding pass has mysteriously vanished, it was there just a minute ago, why does it always do that?
The lady is not useful, like the passengers who help parents and spouses find vanished boarding passes, or the square-shouldered, square-jawed man with a gray buzz cut who effortlessly helps hoist bags into overhead bins as he walks down the aisle of the plane without breaking his stride.
