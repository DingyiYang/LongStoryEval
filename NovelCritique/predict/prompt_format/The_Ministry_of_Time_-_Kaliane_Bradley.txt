### Title: The Ministry of Time

### Genres: Science Fiction, Romance, Time Travel

### Premise:
In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time.
She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts.
Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future.

### Plot Summary:
The narrative oscillates between two timelines: 1859 and the present day, centering on a modern Ministry that manages time travelers—known as expatriates—from different historical periods. This shadowy operation focuses on integrating these expatriates into twenty-first-century society under the guise of adjustment, masking a deeper agenda centered on future wars instigated by the UK’s actions.
The story parallels Capt. McClintock's 1859 Arctic Expedition, which uncovers remnants of Sir John Franklin’s failed venture, juxtaposed with Alice's modern journey at the Ministry. Alice is a consultant helping historical figures adapt to the present, cultivating a deep emotional bond with Graham Gore, a nineteenth-century expatriate. Their romance develops amid the Ministry’s shrouded operations, blending duty with personal desire, setting the stage for existential conflicts.
Piercing through this historical veneer is a contemporary thriller; suspicions of espionage emerge within the Ministry as Quentin, an insider, dies violently, raising concerns about conflicting era-based agendas. Alice and Graham's journey unfolds through intimate connections and cultural collisions, propelled by foreboding threats from both near and distant futures.
Following Adela’s ominous warning, Alice uncovers expatriates’ tracking microchips, revealing them to intensified dangers. They escape through tunnels, uniting with Margaret, a seventeenth-century expatriate. In this ordeal, Alice learns that Adela is her future self, thrusting her into grappling with the Ministry's machinations and personal betrayal.
Despite Graham's protective instincts conflicting with growing distrust towards Alice, she unravels the Ministry's calamitous designs, learning from Adela about the devastating wars to come. Armed with this insight, Alice is driven to dismantle the time-travel project—a task complicated by a futuristic Brigadier's interference.
In the tumultuous denouement, Graham, distrusting Alice, confronts her at gunpoint, disclosing their diverging paths. As the Ministry's operations crumble amid betrayal, Alice tries to sabotage the time-door to prevent further devastation, inadvertently triggering chaos that claims the Brigadier's life. She learns of Simellia's duplicity in the mole plot, unveiling espionage ripples through time.
After the Bridge’s collapse, Alice is entangled in Ministry interrogations. The establishment threatens her severed lover Graham and her identity, but she clings to resolve. Fleeing to her childhood home for solace, Alice confronts grief and revitalized narratives. As she engages with her family, clarity emerges in an unyielding endeavor: reforming through recovered hope.
Alice's world shifts with the arrival of a mysterious parcel from Graham, suggesting refuge in Alaska. This tender reconnection breathes life into a future once marred by uncertainty, urging Alice toward an unexplored journey. The story reconfigures Alice's narrative from unforeseen anguish toward unshakeable renewal, threading hope through the annals of time.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The interviewer said my name, which made my thoughts clip. I don’t say my name, not even in my head. She’d said it correctly, which people generally don’t.
“I’m Adela,” she said. She had an eye patch and blond hair the same color and texture as hay. “I’m the Vice Secretary.”
“Of…?”
“Have a seat.”
This was my sixth round of interviews. The job I was interviewing for was an internal posting. It had been marked SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED because it was gauche to use the TOP SECRET stamps on paperwork with salary bands. I’d never been cleared to this security level, hence why no one would tell me what the job was. As it paid almost triple my current salary, I was happy to taste ignorance. I’d had to produce squeaky-clean grades in first aid, Safeguarding Vulnerable People, and the Home Office’s Life in the UK test to get this far. I knew that I would be working closely with refugees of high-interest status and particular needs, but I didn’t know from whence they were fleeing. I’d assumed politically important defectors from Russia or China.
Adela, Vice Secretary of God knows what, tucked a blond strand behind her ear with an audible crunch.
“Your mother was a refugee, wasn’t she?” she said, which is a demented way to begin a job interview.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Cambodia,” she said.
“Yes, ma’am.”
I’d been asked this question a couple of times over the course of the interview process. Usually people asked it with an upward lilt, expecting me to correct them, because no one’s from Cambodia. You don’t look Cambodian, one early clown had said to me, then glowed like a pilot light because the interview was being recorded for staff monitoring and training purposes. He’d get a warning for that one. People say this to me a lot, and what they mean is: you look like one of the late-entering forms of white—Spanish maybe—and also like you’re not dragging a genocide around, which is good because that sort of thing makes people uncomfortable.
There was no genocide-adjacent follow-up: Any family still there [understanding moue]? Do you ever visit [sympathetic smile]? Beautiful country [darkening with tears]; when I visited [visible on lower lid] they were so friendly.…
Adela just nodded. I wondered if she’d go for the rare fourth option and pronounce the country dirty.
“She would never refer to herself as a refugee, or even a former refugee,” I added. “It’s been quite weird to hear people say that.”
“The people you will be working with are also unlikely to use the term. We prefer ‘expat.’ In answer to your question, I’m the Vice Secretary of Expatriation.”
“And they are expats from…?”
“History.”
“Sorry?”
Adela shrugged. “We have time-travel,” she said, like someone describing the coffee machine. “Welcome to the Ministry.”
