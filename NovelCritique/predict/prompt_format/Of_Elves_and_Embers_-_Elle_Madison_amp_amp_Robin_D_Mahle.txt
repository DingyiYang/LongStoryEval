### Genres: Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy

### Premise:
When I jetted off to Vegas for a reluctant girls’ weekend, the last thing I expected was to tumble through a portal into an alternate reality.
Now, I'm stuck in a world straight out of a fantasy, collared by a king who can't stand the sight of me, and roped into a deal he insists I struck in a previous life - a life where I was an Elven princess, arch-rival to his court.
I keep telling myself it's all a crazy dream, but the memories that barrage me every night are too real to ignore. And, as much as I hate to admit it, there's this inexplicable pull towards this mysterious elf - my captor, my adversary, and, bizarrely, my protector.
King Hadeon is hiding things about our shared history, and I'm not sure I'm ready to dig into that mystery. Even if I dared, the revelations might be more than I can handle.
With the Moon Court Elves gunning for me and wraiths threatening to destroy everything, I'm racing against time and fate. I need to piece together my past life before it's too late, and before history decides to repeat itself.

### Plot Summary:
Ember, the reincarnation of Princess Phaedra, is thrust into a world of celestial beings, ancestral ties, and fate-led journeys in Aelvaria. Initially a captive in the Moon Court, she contends with memories of past lives and complex relationships, especially with King Hadeon. Her path is marked by unlocking powers linked to bloodstone artifacts and fulfilling a looming prophecy. Supported by her brothers Leander and Elion, alongside allies like Celani and Kallius, Ember confronts the threat of Valandril and the shadow wraiths.
Guided by Abba, a divine mentor, Ember becomes a pivotal force in Aelvaria's destiny. Alongside Hadeon, they navigate through the mythical Never Court's curses, solidifying their unity. Their return halts in an inn, recuperating Nyx, Ember's cerberus, and strategizing against the wraiths' menace. Through Chapters Thirty-Eight and onward, Ember's family dynamics and prophecies center around unifying the Moon and Sun Courts. A combined army undertakes a mission against a malevolent source within the Never Court.
Chapter Forty captures the climactic battle against the wraiths and a malicious entity known as the Source. Strategic advancements, deceit, and familial tensions strain alliances, culminating in a pivotal confrontation where Ember and Hadeon's united powers nearly vanquish the malice before Hadeon is critically injured.
In Chapter Forty-One, desperation grips Ember as Hadeon faces a mortal wound from malice. She summons Abba, who reluctantly restores Hadeon, acknowledging their mutual love's power. Chapter Forty-Two rounds off the narrative with the aftermath, showcasing healing, new dynamics among the courts, and interpersonal bonds healing with time. The story peaks as Ember prepares for her coronation as queen. Despite inner insecurities, Hadeon reassures her, and she rises to the occasion. The coronation signifies peace between the courts, solidified by mutual support and her acceptance as Queen Ember. Their bonds cemented by both prophecy and profound love, Ember and Hadeon’s futures intertwine seamlessly.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Death. For the sake of love.
I repeated the words over and over in my head, reminding myself of why I was here. Why I was willfully allowing my body to be ripped apart, to endure pain unlike anything I had ever felt before.
For love.
My skin burned as the Sacred Tree’s roots wrapped around my limbs, slowly embedding themselves into my flesh. A breath hissed past my lips. There was an explosion of light, then nothing but stars.
All my life, I had been haunted by the dying embers of stars sparking across the night sky. Ruled by them. Captivated by them.
It was fitting that they were here now to usher me into death, too.
Blood pooled from the cuts in my hands, streaming down into the glowing water at my feet. My bones ached, and my skin burned, the pain threatening to bring me to my knees. So I focused on the stars at the edges of my vision, reminding myself that I had chosen to be here.
I had chosen to die…for him.
And given the chance to do it all again, I would still choose this.
A quick glance at the women around me revealed expressions that were just as determined as mine. They were the Goddess’s chosen warriors from all over Terrea, full of resolve to endure and to die for the sake of something more than themselves.
If I were a better person, someone less selfish, I would be content that my sacrifice was saving my people as well. But I wasn’t that noble. Maybe I had been once, but now… Now all that consumed me was the visceral need to keep him alive.
I swallowed hard, bracing myself against another wave of pain and squeezing the hands of the mage and fae on either side of me. Then I met Abba’s lavender gaze, filled with untold amounts of grief. She had been with me my entire life, and now she would be here at the very end.
At least I wouldn’t die alone.
A scream shook the air, and the Sacred Tree trembled as her roots began to glow and stretch around the vampire strapped to her trunk. His red eyes lit up with fury, and another anguished wail wrenched from his throat.
My mind flooded with memories of blood-stained battlefields, of shadow monsters that rose from the ashes and tore through my armies. Of death and pain and loss.
All of it was his fault.
He was the reason Abba had called me from the battle back home. He was the reason I was leaving everything behind.
My body shook as I sent the last few waves of my power toward him, wanting to burn him alive for the death and chaos he had wrought throughout Terrea. Another wave of agony washed over me, followed by another and another.
