### Premise:
On the outside they were the golden family with the perfect life. On the inside they built the perfect lie.
A young nanny who plunged to her death, or was she pushed? A nine-year-old girl who collects sharp objects and refuses to speak. A lawyer whose job it is to uncover who in the family is a victim and who is a murderer. But how can you find out the truth when everyone here is lying?
Rose Barclay is a nine-year-old girl who witnessed the possible murder of her nanny - in the midst of her parent's bitter divorce - and immediately stopped speaking. Stella Hudson is a best interest attorney, appointed to serve as counsel for children in custody cases. She never accepts clients under thirteen due to her own traumatic childhood, but Stella's mentor, a revered judge, believes Stella is the only one who can help.
From the moment Stella passes through the iron security gate and steps into the gilded, historic DC home of the Barclays, she realizes the case is even more twisted, and the Barclay family far more troubled, than she feared. And there's something eerie about the house itself: It's a plastic house, with not a single bit of glass to be found.
As Stella comes closer to uncovering the secrets the Barclays are desperate to hide, danger wraps around her like a shroud, and her past and present are set on a collision course in ways she never expected. Everyone is a suspect in the nanny's murder. The mother, the father, the grandmother, the nanny's boyfriend. Even Rose. Is the person Stella's supposed to protect the one she may need protection from?

### Plot Summary:
Stella Hudson, a guardian ad litem, delves into the intricate dynamics of the Barclay family while unraveling mysteries surrounding the death of their nanny, Tina de la Cruz. Caught in a network of deceit, Stella uncovers Ian Barclay’s affair with Tina, the family’s financial struggles, and the manipulations of Ian’s mother, Harriet, who exerts an oppressive control over everyone, especially her granddaughter, Rose.
Stella's investigation intersects with her unresolved personal trauma related to her mother's unexplained death. Her mentor, Charles, emerges as a complex figure, with a past tied deeply to her own. This challenges Stella’s trust but ultimately leads to forgiveness and understanding of his actions, enabling growth in their relationship.
Detective Natalia Garcia supports Stella, both in a professional capacity and later developing a close personal connection. As the plot unfolds, it uncovers Harriet's attempts to isolate and manipulate Rose. Her actions are driven by a delusional desire to protect the family’s facade.

The tension peaks when Harriet's desperation turns potentially violent. Stella discovers Harriet's extensive spying activities and psychological games aimed at forcing Tina out of the picture, leading to a climactic revelation about the true nature of Tina's death and Harriet's intent to make Rose a scapegoat.

The narrative reaches a turning point with Stella and local authorities putting an end to Harriet’s machinations, forcing the Barclays to confront their familial issues and seek a new path forward.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Tuesdays at 4:30 p.m. That’s her routine.
I stand on a grimy square of sidewalk near the busy intersection of 16th and K Streets, scanning the approaching pedestrians.
My new client will arrive in seven minutes.
I don’t even need to meet her today. All I have to do is visually assess her to see if I’ll be able to work with her. The thought makes my shoulders curl forward, as if I’m instinctively forming a version of the fetal position.
I could refuse to take on this client. I could claim it’s impossible for me to be neutral because the media frenzy surrounding the suspicious death of her family’s nanny has already shaped my perceptions.
But that would mean lying to Charles, who is the closest thing I have to a father.
“You know I hate asking for favors, Stella,” Charles said last week from across the booth in his favorite Italian restaurant. He unfolded his heavy white napkin with a flick of his wrist, the crisp snap punctuating his words.
Perhaps a reminder that in all the years I’ve known him, he has never asked me for a single one?
“I’m not sure if I can help her,” I’d told Charles.
“You’re the only one who can. She needs you to be her voice, Stella.”
Saying no to the man who gave me my career, walked me down the aisle, and has provided a shoulder during the dissolution of my marriage isn’t an option. So here I wait.
My new client won’t take any notice of me, a thirty-eight-year-old brunette in a black dress and knee-high boots, seemingly distracted by her phone, just like half the people in this power corridor of DC.
Two minutes until she’s due to arrive.
As the weak October sun ducks behind a cloud, stealing the warmth from the air, a nasal-sounding horn blares behind me. I nearly jump out of my skin.
I whip around to glare at the driver, and when I refocus my attention, my client is rounding the corner a dozen yards away, her blue sweater buttoned up to her neck and her curly red hair spilling over her shoulders. Her expression is wooden.
She’s tiny, even smaller than I expected. She appears to be closer to seven years old than nine.
Her mother—tall, brittle-looking, and carrying a purse that costs more than some cars—holds my client’s hand as they approach their destination: a gray stone building with its address discreetly displayed on a brass plaque. Inside is the office of DC’s top child psychiatrist.
In another few moments, they’ll disappear through the doors and be swallowed up by the building.
She’s just a kid, I remind myself. One who has been through more in the past month than some people endure in a lifetime.
I’m good at my job. Maybe the systems and strategies I’ve developed will carry me through. I can put a favor in Charles’s bank for a change.
