### Title: This Ravenous Fate

### Genres: Fantasy, Lesbian, Vampires

### Premise:
It's 1926 and reapers, the once-human vampires with a terrifying affliction, are on the rise in New York. But the Saint family's thriving reaper-hunting enterprise holds reign over the city, giving them more power than even the organized criminals who run the nightclubs. Eighteen year-old Elise Saint, home after five years in Paris, is the reluctant heir to the empire. Only one thing weighs heavier on Elise's mind than her family obligations: the knowledge that the Harlem reapers want her dead.
Layla Quinn is a young reaper haunted by her past. Though reapers have existed in America for three centuries, created by New World atrocities and cruel experiments, Layla became one just five years ago. The night she was turned, she lost her parents, the protection of the Saints, and her humanity, and she'll never forget how Elise Saint betrayed her.
But some reapers are inexplicably turning part human again, leaving a wake of mysterious and brutal killings. When Layla is framed for one of these attacks, the Saint patriarch offers her a deal she can't refuse: to work with Elise to investigate how these murders might be linked to shocking rumors of a reaper cure. Once close friends, now bitter enemies, Elise and Layla explore the city's underworld, confronting their intense feelings for one another and uncovering the sinister truths about a growing threat to reapers and humans alike.

### Plot Summary:
In a post-war setting of New York City, Elise Saint navigates her tumultuous life under the oppressive control of her father, Tobias Saint. Struggling against societal upheaval caused by reapers—supernatural beings created under mysterious circumstances—Elise returns from France to discover the depth of her father's corrupt dealings tied to the reaper crisis. This realization leads her to forge an unlikely alliance with Layla Quinn, a reaper implicated in a scandalous murder. Together, they aim to untangle the deceit binding their families through an intricate treaty process while unraveling Stephen Wayne's malicious reaper cure plans, which threaten societal stability.
Elise and Layla's complex relationship unfolds amid the chaos, evolving from deep-seated mutual suspicion to a profound emotional bond as they explore trauma surrounding human transformations and familial expectations. Their unity is tested during a gala event when Elise faces Tobias's manipulative dominance, shattering her compliance with the Saint empire. Meanwhile, Layla battles internal conflict over her identity and loyalty, fiercely resisting Stephen Wayne's enticing promises.
As their investigation deepens, Elise and Layla unveil Wayne's nefarious plans, including a pernicious cure that morphs Sterling into a powerful reaper, exemplifying Wayne’s disregard for human life and thrusting Elise into a moral battleground against familial entanglements. The tension peaks during a violent rally when reaper weaponization accelerates under Wayne's influence. Despite the tumult, Layla acts to safeguard Elise, ultimately yielding to her plea to flee after being critically injured. Wayne and Tobias's ambitions unravel amidst Elise's emotional turmoil and deduced betrayals, notably from Valeriya’s manipulations that ensnare her sister Josi.
Post-tragedy, Layla revives Elise from a deadly wound by sharing reaper blood, enhancing their intertwined fate. Their bond represents mutual healing amid societal fracture, yet Layla’s discord with Valeriya magnifies, propelled by unresolved personal history and conflicting interests.
In the ensuing chaos, Elise seeks solace in Josi’s letters while acknowledging her profound isolation. Tension mounts as she and Layla devise plans to relocate to Paris, a possible refuge with advancements in reaper cures, but they are thwarted by external threats: Arendale’s ascension as a tyrannical mayor and Wayne’s continued malevolence.
Layla’s search at the Cotton Club unveils missing poisoned alcohol, a menace potentially stemming from Wayne. Her determination escalates when Elise confronts Valeriya concerning Josi’s fate. The encounter culminates with Elise poisoning Valeriya using a clever antidote strategy formulated from Thalia’s research, leading to Valeriya’s demise and shattering her bond with Layla. As Elise escapes amid the fallout, Layla mourns the loss of familial bonds with Valeriya’s passing.
An enigmatic woman reveals Valeriya's historical significance, proposing an alliance to counteract Wayne's schemes using Valeriya's remains. Meanwhile, Elise's defiance against Tobias materializes during a charged confrontation over Josi's predicament. She renounces the Saint legacy, forsaking the familial empire to embrace autonomy over oppression as patriarchal betrayal crumbles under its weight.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
August 1926
Elise found the world more beautiful when she closed her eyes.
Melancholic jazz music rode the soft sea breeze around the pier, each note lingering like a clandestine kiss. Quiet and unseeing, Elise felt the most herself. Her other senses opened up and softened the edges of her anxieties, making her feel grounded.
Then she opened her eyes. Chelsea Piers came into view around her, the massive docking ocean liner just beyond the piers’ entrance ablaze with the glow of the setting sun. Her pulse thundered in her ears and the jazz notes grew fuzzy. Trying to purge the clamminess from her earlier panic, she wiped her hands across her skirt, then stepped toward the waiting car.
Once finished loading Elise’s luggage into the trunk, Colm, her family’s driver, helped her into the automobile. “Your ship docked late. My apologies, Miss Saint, but we’re in a race against the sunset. Your father is already in a mood.” He glanced at her through the rearview mirror as the engine roared to life. “Welcome home, by the way.”
Elise thought facing her father again sounded worse than being out after the sun went down. As far as she was concerned, the house in Harlem was no longer her home. Not in a city full of monsters who craved the taste of her blood. Monsters like the one her best friend had become.
The car turned north, and though the sky over Manhattan darkened, the streets were still full of people, hats held down against the evening breeze and faces twisted with fear.
Colm stepped on the gas. To settle her nerves, Elise peeked into her bag for what she knew was the fifth time that hour. The letter with the lovely golden seal of the Paris Conservatory was still there, staring back up at her. Her fingers plucked at the loose threads on her coat seven times, her chest growing tighter while the residential buildings of Riverside Drive whipped past her window. They quickly neared Sugar Hill. Elise wondered how much had changed in five years. Whether Layla was even still alive—
Colm cursed in the front seat as he hit the brakes. Pedestrians rushed the intersection the car was trying to cross. “Everyone wants to be close to Saint territory at night,” he explained.
