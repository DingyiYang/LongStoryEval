### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
ON THE MORNING OF HER IMPENDING DEATH, LIFE LOUNGED BENEATH a wisteria tree.
Her magic had shaped the branches, twisting them into a canopy to shield her from the sun while she curled her feet in the grass, its dampness slick between her toes. Beside her, Fate was hunched over his latest work in progress. Life followed every twitch and pull of his deft fingers as they wove a lifetime into a tapestry. There was a glimmer in his eyes as he worked, one that Life wished to forever commit to memory.
Because soon Death would arrive to take all that she was. And once he came, there was no knowing what pieces of herself might be left. She could only hope to remember that Fate tended to bounce ever so slightly when he was particularly pleased with one of his creations, and that he had a dimple on his right cheek that looked as though someone had carved the tip of their fingernail into his flesh, forever marking him with a mischievous crescent moon. She hoped she remembered the way all the light in the world seemed to pool toward him at any given moment, and how he would bask in it. Whether it was midafternoon or an hour when only the crickets sang, her husband was radiant.
Life hoped that she would remember his hands, too. Not just how clever they were—as precise with an instrument or a paintbrush as they were with thread and needle—but how they melded against her body. She had no awareness of how she came to exist, and often wondered whether she’d been one of Fate’s sculptures magicked to life, for it was his hands alone that knew her every contour. Every touch between them was familiar, instinctual.
“Enjoying the view?” Fate didn’t need to peer behind him to know that Life was spying, no less struck by his beauty now than the day she’d first laid eyes on him. Fate was her summer sun—too intense for most to bear, while she tipped toward him like a flower, craving his touch.
Life shifted to her knees, wrapping her arms around Fate’s neck as she looked over his shoulder at the tapestry.
Red. There was always so much red.
She’d known Fate long enough to understand why—red symbolized passion, and there was nothing he loved more. Fate’s favorite stories were always rife with the color, telling tales of those who would give up their very soul to have whatever it was they most yearned for. He was never choosy with what that passion was. It could be art, literature, invention, romance, cooking, gardening.… If there was passion to be found, Fate would weave the most glorious stories out of it. For he, too, was a man of great passion.
