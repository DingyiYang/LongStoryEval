### Plot Summary:
In "Sierton High," the story follows Dawn Foster, formerly known as Hannah Smith, as she embarks on a turbulent journey driven by a desire for revenge against those who bullied her, ultimately leading to fatal consequences. After surviving a suicide attempt and losing her parents in a tragic accident caused by a drunk driver, Hannah adopts a new identity to confront her past tormentors at Sierton High. Blending into her high school surroundings as Dawn, she plots her revenge against the primary instigator, Ella Moore.
Hannah's scheme leads her to murder Ella using rat poison, an act that marks her drastic transition from victim to avenger. In her transformation, her innocent brother Isaac is falsely accused of the crime, symbolizing the injustice rampant in their environment. The narrative darkens as Dawn reveals her identity to her former bullies, Naomi and Lucy, in a dramatic confrontation at a remote cabin. Desperate to hold them accountable for their past cruelty, Dawn drugs the girls and attempts to burn the cabin with all of them inside. The climax underscores Hannah's descent into madness driven by unresolved grief, guilt, and vengeance.
Simultaneously, Madison, Dawn's aunt, grows increasingly concerned over her niece's behavior. Upon discovering Dawn’s incriminating letter, Madison endeavors to intercept her at the cabin, only to arrive amidst a raging fire. Despite the overwhelming odds, the timely intervention of firefighters ensures the survival of those inside, halting Dawn's destructive plan.
A year later, Hannah finds herself institutionalized in a psychiatric facility following a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. There, she reflects on her actions and the path that led her to this state, undergoing therapy and exploring her awareness and remorse about her crimes. Her sessions with Dr. Harper delve into Hannah's past traumas, and although she outwardly appears rehabilitated, her inner thoughts reveal a calculated manipulation of her medication and a vision of her deceased parents, indicating unresolved issues and a sinister intent to resume her vengeful quest.
The narrative concludes with a visit from Raquel, a former schoolmate, whose presence signifies the stark contrast between Hannah's stagnation and her peers' progression in life. While portraying a façade of recovery, Hannah inwardly contemplates the unfinished business with Naomi and Lucy, hinting at a disturbing future preoccupied with the completion of her revenge. At its core, "Sierton High" examines the devastating effects of bullying, the thirst for vengeance spun from unresolved trauma, and the moral complexities entwined within the struggle for personal justice.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
NOW
The soft, tuneless whistling drifts over to where she’s hiding, as she crouches in the dark closet, peeking through the slats.
She hadn’t known how loud simply breathing was. Surely the person hunting her can hear her panicked, shallow breaths—and her too-loud heartbeat, thumping against her ribs like a frantic trapped bird. To make things worse, it’s so dusty that she’s going to sneeze. She pinches her nose, fights the deadly urge. Sweat trickles down her back, like the faint caress of ghostly fingers.
Her eyelids droop closed…but she snaps them open again. She focuses her eyes on the narrow line of light pooling under the closed bedroom door. She must not fall asleep. Absolutely cannot sink into the darkness that is threatening to engulf her. But she can feel how heavy her limbs are, heavy and clumsy with the drug slushing through her bloodstream. She pinches her left arm hard, twists the tender skin to keep herself awake.
A nightmare. That’s what this is. Even so, she can’t quite believe that this is happening, that someone is trying to kill her. Surely, she’ll wake up soon in her queen-sized bed with its eight-hundred-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets. The muscle in her right calf seizes in a painful cramp from crouching for so long, and she stifles another sob.
It’s so unfair. She doesn’t deserve this, no matter what she did. The punishment is too harsh! She could cry from the injustice of it. A sob bubbles up from her chest to her throat, and she clamps her shaking hands over her mouth to keep it from escaping. Her mind is shrieking, but she mustn’t make a peep because the smallest sound would give away her hiding place in a second. And then this game of hide-and-seek would be over. The end. You lose. Time to die.
Soft, deliberate footsteps now, in the corridor. That insane, tuneless whistling. The footsteps grow louder…and louder…until they stop just outside. There is a shadow under the door. She watches through the slats as the knob turns slowly…
But she’s locked the door from the inside! The knob stops turning, and she’s almost giddy with relief. She starts to smile…
But then there’s the unmistakable scritch scratch of a key entering the keyhole. The bedroom door swings open, and that horrible whistling starts up again. She tears herself away from the slats, scrambles backward into the darkness at the back of the closet. Shrinks into a small ball, her knees pressed against her chin. Nonono, I can’t die like this can’t die like this can’t—
The closet doors open. She looks up at the person standing over her trembling body. The whistling stops.
“Found you.”
Those empty eyes.
That awful smile.
The dull gleam of the carving knife.
She opens her mouth and screams.
