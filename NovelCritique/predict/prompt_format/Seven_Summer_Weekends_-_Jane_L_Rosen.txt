### Title: Seven Summer Weekends

### Genres: Romance, Contemporary, Womens Fiction

### Premise:
When a Zoom disaster upends Addison Irwin’s decade-long career at a posh Manhattan advertising agency, things look bleak for the thirty-something mid-western transplant. But an unexpected inheritance from an aunt she barely remembers—a property on Fire Island, complete with guest house and artist’s studio—changes everything.
 
While debating whether to stay or sell, Addison learns that she’s also inherited her aunt’s list of eclectic guests, tying her to the island for seven summer weekends. Eager to convince Addison to keep the house rather than let a new buyer build a monstrosity in its place, the neighbors welcome her to their laid-back community. Well, all except the moody guy next door, who seems intent on glowering his way through life.
 
Steadfast in her path since college, Addison is determined not to let this detour on Fire Island throw her off track. But soon, between the revolving door of weekend visitors and the up-and-down relationship with her neighbor (and his adorable dog), she finds herself in unfamiliar territory. Should she try to pick up where she left off—or embrace entirely new possibilities?

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
When Addison Irwin reflects on the fateful day in June when her life was upended, it plays out in front of her eyes like the opening sequence of a nineties rom-com. Music and all.
In her mind, Vanessa Carlton belts the title track “A Thousand Miles” as Addison makes her way downtown “walking fast / faces pass,” though she’s work bound, not homebound. It is summer in Manhattan, and Addison is dressed in a crisp white blouse, tan linen capris, and ballet flats. She ascends from the subway station at Fifty-Third and Lex with the confidence of a thirty-four-year-old woman rumored to be first in line for promotion to art director at the Silas and Grant Advertising Agency.
This will most definitely be a day to remember, she was happily thinking to herself. She wondered where it would stand compared to receiving the Danhausen award for sculpture at art school graduation or attaining her highest-ranking title thus far: Color War General at Camp Mataponi.
Addison’s rumored promotion would make her not only the youngest to hold the role of art director at the firm, but the first woman to do so. She’d been channeling the seventies advertising icon Shirley Polykoff, who was the inspiration for the fictional Peggy Olson on Mad Men, since she had first arrived. Unlike most women her age, whose motivation to move to the Big Apple stemmed from watching episodes of Sex and the City, Addison Irwin was a Mad Men girl. Though it should be noted that she ended up with a matching set of friends to Carrie Bradshaw’s three besties—if not in personality, at least in hair color.
Today, all the years of late nights and canceled plans would finally pay off. Addison crossed her fingers that the company’s illustrious CEO, Richard Grant, would make the big announcement—her big announcement—during the company-wide Zoom this morning. She picked up her pace.
Richard Grant, the grandson of the Grant in Silas and Grant and the heir to the seventy-year-old advertising agency, had been groomed to lead the company since birth. He was competent enough, and fairly democratic in his leadership style, but there was a disconnect that prevented anyone from truly liking him. He was tone-deaf to the point of embarrassment, and while his tendency to see things only from his own perspective made for hours of interoffice laughter and camaraderie, it annoyed Addison immensely. While Addison loved the fact that the firm had been in the same family since its start, she recoiled when Grant bragged about his accomplishments, personal and business, as if his success had nothing to do with his prince-like status and familial connections.
Addison caught her freckled reflection in a store window on Madison Avenue and twisted her wavy brown hair into a high pony. You got this, she thought to herself, pushing any remaining butterflies from her belly.
