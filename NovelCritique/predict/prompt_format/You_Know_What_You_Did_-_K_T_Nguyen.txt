### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Let me help with the funeral stuff,” Tabby says, grabbing a cold kombucha from the fridge. “I could find the caterer for Grandma’s wake or whatever. Like when Papa died last summer.”
After Annie’s father-in-law passed away quietly at the Shaw family estate in Boston, Tabby proudly assisted with telephone calls and vendor arrangements. Duncan Shaw welcomed his daughter’s involvement even though the thirteen-year-old’s constant questions about how and what to do ultimately created more work for him. He confided in Annie, “Any inconvenience is well worth it, if it helps Tabby to process her grief.”
Now Annie flips through a stack of mail on the counter, buying time as she struggles to craft a tactful response to her daughter’s offer. There will be no funeral for Mẹ. Annie, riddled with guilt, couldn’t even bring herself to attend the cremation. Duncan had taken care of it for her, disappearing for several hours one morning then returning with four and a half pounds of cremains in a black plastic tub.
Fortunately, something on the kombucha label has caught Tabby’s eye and distracted her from the topic of funeral plans. The girl’s nose, freckled from a decade of riding lessons, crinkles. “This says ‘Made in San Francisco,’ but locally brewed is so much better for us and for the environment. Do better, Mom.” At that, she raises the bottle to her rosebud lips and chugs the entire thing.
Six dollars gulped down in fifteen seconds. At times like this, Annie can’t help but notice how much Tabby takes for granted. She’d never wanted her daughter to grow up as she herself did—and perhaps had overcompensated as a result, buying trendy brands and ignoring Duncan’s penchant for lavishing expensive gifts on his little girl.
Tabby swipes her lips on the sleeve of her crisp white hoodie, then tosses the empty bottle into a stainless steel recycling bin built into the custom cabinetry. Again, she fixes a pair of expectant brown eyes on her mother. “So what can I do?”
Annie clears her throat nervously and attempts to level expectations as gently as possible.
“We’re not doing a funeral. Just the cremation. I thought you knew . . . there’s nobody to invite anyway. Grandma didn’t have any friends left, and there aren’t any other relatives that I know of.”
This was completely true. Annie hadn’t even met her father or her older brother, nor did she know the particular circumstances of their deaths. Mẹ had never been willing to share much, only vaguely alluding to the fact that they both died during the war.
“Um . . . well, what about the ceremony to spread the ashes or the wake?” Tabby’s voice is growing precariously thin and nasal. With the fragile pride of a teenager, she’s taken the rejection of her help, so rarely offered, personally. “I mean, if we don’t do something, Grandma’s ghost won’t be able to rest.”
