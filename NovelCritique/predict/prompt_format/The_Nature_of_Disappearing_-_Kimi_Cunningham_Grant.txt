### Title: The Nature of Disappearing

### Genres: Thriller, Mystery, Mystery Thriller

### Premise:
Emlyn doesn’t let herself think about the past.
How she and her best friend, Janessa, barely speak anymore. How Tyler, the man she thought was the love of her life, left her freezing and half-dead on the side of the road three years ago.
Her new life is simple and safe. She works as a fishing and hunting guide, spending her days in Idaho’s endless woods and scenic rivers. She lives alone in her Airstream trailer, her closest friends a handsome and kind Forest Service ranger and the community’s makeshift reverend, who took her in at her lowest.
But when Tyler shows up with the news that Janessa is missing, Emlyn is propelled back into the world she worked so hard to forget. Janessa, it turns out, has become a social media star, documenting her #vanlife adventures with her rugged survivalist boyfriend. But she hasn’t posted lately, and when she does, it’s from a completely different location than where her caption claims to be. In spite of their fractured history, Emlyn knows she might be the only one with the knowledge and tracking skills to save her friend, so she reluctantly teams up with Tyler. As the two trace Janessa’s path through miles of wild country, Emlyn can’t deny there’s still chemistry crackling between them. But the deeper they press into the wilderness, the more she begins to suspect that a darker truth lies in the woods―and that Janessa isn’t the only one in danger.

### Plot Summary:
Emlyn, a dedicated fly-fishing guide in Idaho, embarks on a mission to find her college friend Janessa, who has become entwined with Bush, a dangerous narcotics distributor. This journey draws in Emlyn's ex-lover Tyler, whose history of addiction complicates matters. Together, Emlyn and Janessa delve into the wilderness, uncovering truths about betrayal and redemption. Tyler’s sudden departure overnight leaves behind an apologetic note, spurring Emlyn and Janessa to pursue him with the belief that he seeks to confront Bush.
Throughout their journey, Emlyn grapples with her mistrust of Tyler and the imminent danger Bush represents. Janessa reveals her covert operation to dismantle Bush's criminal empire, setting the stage for their climactic encounter. Upon catching up with Tyler, they learn of his destructive intentions to erase Janessa's evidence, exposing his fears and conflicting loyalties. Janessa’s accounts of Bush's misdeeds intertwine with Tyler’s confessions, deepening the narrative’s complexity.
The confrontation with Bush culminates in a life-or-death struggle at a lake. Emlyn and Janessa fend off Bush, with Emlyn ultimately choosing compassion over revenge by saving Bush from drowning. This act of grace underscores Emlyn's growth and moral fortitude.

As night falls, Emlyn recalls her relationship with Tyler, discerning that her understanding was built on illusions.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
SMOKE tinges the world white. It swallows the spired treetops and narrows the canyon ahead. It erases altogether the majestic gray faces of the Obsidians, shrouds the valley, slips up the ravines. Emlyn stands midstream, the river lulling at her thighs, pressing her waders tight.
A shadow overhead, a flash of dark. In a moment it swoops to the water, hard and fast. A bright splash as it hits the surface, then it lifts, flapping higher, its catch secure in its talons. Osprey. Emlyn looks at the client, clambering ahead and sloshing upstream, and wonders if he sees it. Some people, they feel the trout in these waters belong to them and not the birds, and Emlyn has a feeling the client is such a person.
John Thomas is his name, and he seems to hold it against her that the wildfires in California are ruining the cerulean Idaho skies promised on the company website. Earlier, as they’d loaded gear into the truck, he’d waved his hand toward the gray-white space in the distance where the Obsidians hid, veiled in smoke, and, frowning, said, “I thought there were mountains.”
He’d arrived fourteen minutes early in an Aston Martin Vantage, teal with a yellow pinstripe down its hood. Emlyn had tried not to stare, which is exactly what a car-loving person like herself was wont to do, and exactly what a person who drove such a car expected people to do. She’d tried not to eye the handcrafted Oyster bamboo rod, which she knew carried a price tag of forty-six hundred dollars, though, in the end, she couldn’t keep herself from commenting. And she’d tried not to look too hard at him, John Thomas, maybe ten years her senior but glowing with good looks and vigor, a shining example of how money could prolong youth. He’d climbed out of the Aston Martin, extended a smooth hand, and flashed her a winning smile. “I’ve heard great things about you,” he’d said.
To her relief, she’d delivered. Well, that and they’d been lucky. Luck was always part of the story. She’d set him up with a hopper-dropper—the hopper peach with Sharpied dots on its underside, the dropper a zebra nymph, both of which she’d made herself—and the man had caught a fat, glimmering brown trout in a public stretch of the Salmon, early in the day. Later, and to his great delight, he’d taken a small bull trout in a tributary on the Henning Ranch, where Emlyn had permission to fish. She’d cited statistics about the odds of such an accomplishment and snapped a slew of photos before returning it to the cold water.
