### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
‘Ah, for Christ’s sake . . .’
As there was another knock at the front door.
He raked a hand down his face, forced himself out of his armchair, and, draining the last of his bottle of beer, stomped into the hallway.
Through the frosted glass he could see two figures, one taller than the other, both in black. They were about to knock a third time when Frank swung the door open.
‘Hi! Good morning.’ The smaller figure – a woman – sing-songed, masking her disgust at his appearance with a kindly tilt of her head. The man, a pale pencil, just smiled gormlessly at Frank, as though he was staring into the face of a child.
‘We’re really sorry to bother you this morning. We were—’
But Frank saw the leaflet the tall man was holding, with its picture of a candle encircled by a crown of thorns, and knew what was to follow. They weren’t sorry to bother him at all.
With an enthusiasm that made his left eye twitch, the woman continued:
‘—wondering if we could speak to you today about happiness, your life . . .’ Her eyes fly-fished to the bottle in his hand. ‘And maybe what might be missing? Perhaps even how Jesus might be a part of . . .’
Frank blinked once, slowly.
And then:
‘Come on in!’ he said, with sudden enthusiasm, his Irish brogue dialled up to eleven. ‘Please, come!’
A spark of surprise passed between the two, as he stood aside and ushered them through the door and into the cramped hallway. They wiped their feet on a tattered mat and Frank, a beaming smile on his face, held out an arm, guiding them past the stairs. ‘Please, it’s just this way.’
Down the hallway, they processed – past an old dresser cluttered with pictures and a long-deceased spider plant – and finally into the kitchen.
‘Just . . . right through here.’
Frank then opened the back door and unceremoniously bundled the pair outside. ‘Now, off you fuck,’ he said, as he showed them two fingers and threw the door closed behind them, their confused faces discernible through the obscured glass.
His own face instantly returned to its resting state of weary and annoyed, and he tossed the empty beer bottle towards the nearby bin. It missed by a foot, clattered against the skirting board and disappeared under the kitchen table. Frank huffed and opened the fridge to retrieve another as his wife appeared at the bottom of the stairs.
‘Well, that was a bit mean,’ she said, as she leaned against the wall.
