### Plot Summary:
In the suburb of Palmetto, the disappearance of Becca, the best friend of protagonist Nora, triggers a series of mysterious and supernatural events. Nora is drawn into a web of intrigue, investigating the strange behavior of classmates and their connection to Miss Ekstrom, a teacher with a complex past. The narrative intertwines present-day events with a historical flashback to the 1960s when a young Miss Ekstrom, then named Rita, lived under societal constraints while having a forbidden relationship with Patty. Following Patty's mysterious death and subsequent rebellion against school authority figures, Ekstrom became an agent for a supernatural goddess tasked with vanquishing perceived evil. The goddess's presence persists into modern times, impacting Becca and, eventually, Nora.
Nora uncovers the dark truth about Becca's disappearance—she was nearly possessed by the goddess through an arcane ritual led by Ekstrom. Though the possession fails to fully claim Becca, it leaves her trapped in another realm. During this ordeal, she's temporarily freed at night and leaves Nora elusive messages to play the "goddess game." Eventually, Nora confronts the entity herself, becoming a vessel for the goddess's wrath against those deemed evil. Despite the oppressive control of the supernatural force, Nora manages to banish the entity using the emotional depth of her connection with Becca.
Following these events, Becca mysteriously returns, though their ordeal has indelibly changed both friends. Becca recounts the profound experience of being in a surreal, infinite house that her mind created for protection while being entwined with the goddess. Her return is marked by unique otherworldly signs, like growing unusual teeth and silver-white hair. As Becca recovers at the hospital, she and Nora tentatively navigate the ramifications of their supernatural experiences, with Becca gradually revealing details to Nora. The girls' bond deepens as they share these confessions, drawing solace and understanding from each other.
Meanwhile, Nora's relationship with James flourishes, offering her a reprieve from the traumatic events. As she balances her connections with Becca and James, Nora recognizes the lingering effects of the goddess's influence and her emotional journey toward healing and acceptance. The story ends with a hopeful note, suggesting potential recovery and a brighter future despite their shared past of supernatural encounters and personal loss.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“BE GOOD.”
“Uh-huh.” Chloe Park angled her head to look at the house’s top-floor windows. Two were yellow-lit, edged in pale curtain. That would be Piper’s bedroom. She could picture it already. Trophies and craft supplies, inspirational posters rendered in sugary neon.
“Chloe.”
Her mother said it forcefully enough that Chloe looked. The older woman’s hands gripped the wheel, manicured nails and a wedding band so delicate it looked like gold thread.
“Be good,” she repeated. “Please.”
“Okay, Mommy.” Chloe shouldered her overnight bag and left the car.
Piper Sebranek had brown eyes, shiny brown horse hair that fell to the middle of her back, and a reputation for supreme niceness. Chloe got the sense Piper had been the queen of her junior high, but look at her now. Just another freshman nobody.
She and Chloe weren’t friends, obviously, but their mothers worked together at a law firm in the city. Two days ago Piper dropped a birthday party invitation on Chloe’s desk in American Lit, all the details written in swoopy calligraphy on lilac card stock.
Chloe had skimmed it, then said, “You couldn’t have just told me this?”
Piper smiled with her glossy lips only, fingers fraying the end of her ponytail. “My mom made me invite you.”
So. Maybe not that nice. Chloe smiled back. “Can’t wait.”
By 8 p.m. she was regretting her decision. She would’ve pretended to pass out early, but Piper’s weird private school friend Diahann had announced she’d be drawing a mustache on the first person who fell asleep. A mustache. These dorks.
Diahann brought a Tarot deck, Anjali three cigarettes in a ziplock bag, two of them snapped and leaking. Ashley got really wild and pulled out a whole hard lemonade. Everyone but Chloe took turns sipping it, after which Diahann stripped to her bra and lay on the floor, whisper-screaming, “I can feel it!”
Diahann fell asleep first. Piper covered her with a fleece blanket and put on Booksmart, then dumped the contents of a fat cosmetics bag onto the green-and-blue rag rug. Good stuff, Chloe noted. Sephora brands.
“Makeup!” Ashley clapped her hands like the makeup had put on a little show. She approached Chloe with a brush in one outheld hand. “You have the shiniest hair,” she began.
This happened a lot. People saw Chloe’s size and prettiness and age, a year younger than anyone else in their grade, and thought, pet.
“Fuck off,” she said.
After that, they left her alone.
When the movie was over the other girls hugged each other, then took turns going to the bathroom with their toiletry bags and their neat little piles of folded pajamas. The lamp went off and Chloe faced the wall. Bursts of giggly whispering broke out with decreasing frequency until finally the room was quiet. For a while after that she lay unmoving in the glow of Piper’s night-light, tracking the shallow breath of the sleepers.
