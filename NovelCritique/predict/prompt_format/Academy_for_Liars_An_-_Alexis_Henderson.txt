### Premise:
Lennon Carter’s life is falling apart. 
Then she gets a mysterious phone call inviting her to take the entrance exam for Drayton College, a school of magic hidden in a secret pocket of Savannah. Lennon has been chosen because—like everyone else at the school—she has the innate gift of persuasion, the ability to wield her will like a weapon, using it to control others and, in rare cases, matter itself. 
After passing the test, Lennon begins to learn how to master her devastating and unsettling power. But despite persuasion’s heavy toll on her body and mind, she is wholly captivated by her studies, by Drayton’s lush, moss-draped campus, and by her brilliant classmates. But even more captivating is her charismatic adviser, Dante, who both intimidates and enthralls her. 
As Lennon continues in her studies her control grows, and she starts to uncover more about the secret world she has entered into, including the disquieting history of Drayton College, and the way her mentor’s tragic and violent past intertwines with it. She is increasingly disturbed by what she learns. For it seems that the ultimate test is to embrace absolute power without succumbing to corruption . . . and it's a test she's terrified she is going to fail.

### Plot Summary:
Lennon's journey at Drayton College intricately weaves her burgeoning psychic abilities with a struggle against deeply entrenched manipulations within the institution. Initially bound by Drayton's coercive grip, Lennon discovers the true purpose of her talents: to maintain the campus's magical boundaries that hinge upon William, the frail chancellor's, survival. Faced with his impending death, she confronts the looming threat of being trapped in his role as a perpetuator of Drayton's sinister legacy.
As tensions heighten, Lennon finds both betrayal and loyalty among her friends. Notably, Blaine transitions from self-serving behavior to becoming a steadfast ally. Lennon's escape prompts dangerous entanglements, unraveling Drayton's dark influences further, exacerbated by her conflict with Nadine. Misunderstandings and resulting tragedies compound Lennon's feelings of isolation and burden.
Amidst turmoil, Drayton collapses—highlighting Lennon's pivotal struggle for agency. Lennon's resistance against Eileen, who seeks to exploit her abilities, culminates in a climactic face-off. Dante's sacrificial actions lend Lennon the crucial support needed to wield her powers effectively, ultimately ensuring Drayton's survival. His death scars Lennon deeply, but her determination to reforge her own destiny and protect the students prevails.
Emerging as a reluctant leader, Lennon ruthlessly deposes corrupt faculty members, restructuring the school in her likeness. Despite assuming the chancellorship, she withdraws from active involvement, retreating to Dante's house and grappling with grief. Her isolation grows as she contemplates the scope of her powers and the future shaped by her choices.
During Christmas, concerned friends visit Lennon, alleviating her pervasive loneliness, yet their visit underscores her lingering resentment and despair over Dante's ultimate fate. Driven by guilt and hope, Lennon obsessively delves into Dante's past, using her powers to investigate pivotal memories linked to his disappearance.
After a series of taxing attempts, Lennon reaches Dante in a critical moment from his childhood. Their encounter is emotionally charged, characterized by an acceptance of fate and shared love. Dante's choice to return to the present—and Lennon's demonstrated acceptance of his autonomy—result in his survival and their reunion, both characters poised for healing and new beginnings.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
There was something in the bathroom mirrors. Lennon first noticed when she was standing between them, preparing for her own engagement party. One of the mirrors hung above the sink behind her; the other hung above the sink in front of her. Standing between the two, she gazed with glassy eyes at the reflections of herself reflecting one another, on and on, shrinking into the dark and distant ether.
Every one of them looked miserable, which was to be expected.
Lennon had realized some time ago that her misery was less a problem with the wedding than with her. She had been in a bad way for months—unmoored, discordant, occupying her own body with a sense of unease, the way one might in an airport terminal or the lobby of a rent-by-the-hour motel. Her own flesh and bone a kind of liminal space.
She’d hoped things would change with the engagement. So she’d attended the cake tastings and the dress fittings, and she’d made a deposit on the venue and secured a film photographer, who would be flying in from out of state for the occasion. She’d sent wax-sealed invites across the country to her family members and a few seat-filler friends. And now here she was, alone in her bathroom regretting everything and so desperate to be somewhere, anywhere, else that she would’ve almost rather died than face the engagement party outside her bedroom door. It was something of a miracle, then, that she finished her makeup. Her body seemed to perform the act without her, and when it was done, she stared at all of her faces in the mirror and saw someone, many someones, that she didn’t know.
And then she slapped herself.
One hand raised—all of the other Lennons in the mirror raising their hands with her—and a sharp pop across her freshly blushed cheek. The slap carried down through the legion of her reflections and then stopped.
One of the Lennons in the mirror didn’t strike its cheek. It didn’t move at all really, except to smile, its lips pulling up at the edges, as if the corners of its mouth were attached to strings that had been sharply tugged. Then it sidestepped out of line, edging up through the ranks, walking toward her. It was like her in almost every way—bony bronzed arms sparsely tattooed, thin high nose spattered with freckles, long braids unfurling halfway down her back—but there was one glaring difference between Lennon and the defecting reflection in the mirror: she had eyes, but this…thing did not. It strode toward her, smiling all the while.
Lennon wheeled to face the mirror behind her, saw nothing except the same girl moving toward her, through the shifting ranks of the line. Panicked, she glanced around the bathroom but saw that she was alone.
