### Premise:
It’s never easy working fire scenes.
Called to Washington, DC to analyse the victims of a mysterious arson attack, Tempe quickly finds her misgivings justified. The fire site is in Foggy Bottom, a neighbourhood with a colourful history, and as the pieces start falling into place, the property’s ownership becomes more and more suspicious.
Sensing a good story, Tempe teams up with a new ally, telejournalist Ivy Doyle. Delving into the past, the duo learns that back in the Thirties and Forties the home was the hangout of a group of bootleggers and racketeers known as the Foggy Bottom Gang. Though interesting, this fact seems irrelevant – until the son of one of the gang members is shot dead at his farm in Virginia.
When another Foggy Bottom Gang-linked property burns to the ground, claiming one more victim, what might have been coincidence starts to look more like targeted attacks. As she and Ivy dig deeper, Tempe’s instincts point towards the somehow, her every move since coming to Washington has been anticipated in advance. And every path forward brings with it a lethal threat.

### Plot Summary:
Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist, is deeply entrenched in unearthing a convoluted web of crime in Washington, DC. Following a devastating fire in Foggy Bottom, Brennan investigates the event, suspecting connections to the historical Foggy Bottom Gang and modern financial corruption linked to W-C Commerce, which owns the affected properties.
Brennan's journey is intertwined with journalist Ivy Doyle's investigative zeal. Their joint efforts examine the involvement of Ronan and Roy Stoll and their emotionally troubled grandmother, Susan Lipsey, who harbors a longstanding resentment against the Warring family. Lipsey's vendetta for past perceived injustices fuels suspicion of her role in the recent arson and murders. The narrative intricately weaves Brennan's forensic skills and Detective Merle Deery's procedural approach, unveiling deeper connections between past vendettas and present crimes.
Amid professional complexities, Brennan navigates personal tensions, particularly with partner Andrew Ryan. Ivy’s fiancé, Ben Zanetti, initially aids in exploring financial crimes before becoming suspect following Brennan’s observations of his infidelity. Meanwhile, the police, led by Sergeant Burgos, open additional pathways of inquiry in the arson cases, shedding light on new methodologies that blur criminal culpability.
The plot escalates when Brennan confronts Lipsey during a dangerous episode, resulting in Deery being shot and Lipsey accidentally injuring herself. In the chaos, Brennan’s focus shifts to the identity of the “subcellar lady,” potentially linking her to a decades-old criminal conspiracy. Brennan's interactions with Zanetti reveal his double-dealing and threats to her safety, culminating in a climactic confrontation where she manages to activate a panic button before Zanetti is apprehended by police.
As Brennan and Ryan recuperate in Middleburg, Virginia, they reflect on the motivations behind Zanetti's actions, pointing to his desperation to marry into wealth after killing Raelynn Krassle to silence her threats over exposing his infidelity. Ultimately, Brennan ties the loose ends of the contemporary crimes with the historical narrative, embodying the resolve of past grievances impacting the present.
Parallel to unraveling Zanetti’s culpability, Brennan identifies a mummified body found in a Foggy Bottom subcellar as Ruby Berle Dockeray, a woman missing since 1943. The discovery adds an emotional dimension, giving long-lost Ruby a dignified burial despite the circumstances of her unfortunate demise.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
FOGGY BOTTOM
WASHINGTON, DC
Her nose prickled.
Her throat itched.
She coughed.
Old buildings are musty, she told herself, groggy with sleep.
But why the acrid smell? And what was that bitter taste on her tongue?
Had her instincts been correct? Should she have fled upon seeing the nightmare warren of jerry-rigged rooms? The windowless space her fifty bucks had secured?
She opened her eyes.
To total darkness.
Dust. It’s only dust.
Not convinced of that explanation, her hypothalamus ordered up a precautionary round of adrenaline.
Her olfactory lobe IDed the pillow, dank and mildewed from decades spent cushioning the heads of down-in-the-heels travelers. She raised up from it. Slid her phone from beneath it.
The screen came to life, illuminating her hand and the frayed ribbon bordering the ratty polyester blanket. The cast-off glow revealed little else of her surroundings.
Swinging her legs over the side of the mattress, she sat up, scrolled left, and tapped the flashlight app. Sent the plucky little beam looping around her.
Shadows bounced from the room’s sparse furnishings in a jumble of cascading angles and shapes. A bureau held level with an ancient keyboard jammed under one corner. A rusty brass floor lamp. A wheeled metal clothing rack holding four hangers.
Nothing alarming.
Until the narrow white shaft landed on the door.
Black smoke was oozing through the gap where the bottom failed to meet the floor. Beyond the gap, orange-and-yellow light danced fitfully.
Flames?
Barely breathing, she tiptoe ran across the carpet and placed a palm on one panel.
The wood felt warm.
She touched the knob.
Hot!
Using the hem of her tee, she turned the handle and inched open a peephole. Flames twisted around the bed and curled the drapes at the window in the adjacent room.
Her breath froze.
She slammed the door.
Ohgodohgodohgod!
She listened. Heard no alarm. No sirens.
What to do!? What to do!?
She called out.
“Help! Please! I’m in here!”
Nothing.
She yelled again and again until her throat screamed.
Catching her breath, she strained for any sign of another human being.
Heard no voice. No movement.
Make a run for it? Somehow that seemed wrong. There were flames just beyond her door. She had no idea of the safest route out of the building.
Heart hammering, she retrieved her mobile and jabbed at digits with one trembling finger. Missed. Tried again.
A woman answered on the first ring.
Nine one one. What’s your emergency?
The building I’m in is on fire!
Ma’am. Please stay calm.
Oh, God!
Give me your location.
I don’t know the address. It’s a rented room.
Okay. I’ve alerted the fire department. A team will arrive shortly.
I’m going to die!
No. You’re not. I’ll stay on the line with you. Do you understand?
Yes.
She coughed.
Ma’am, are you injured?
It’s getting hard to breathe.
Does the room have a fire escape?
No!
Her eyes felt like smoldering embers. Tears ran down her cheeks.
A window?
No!
