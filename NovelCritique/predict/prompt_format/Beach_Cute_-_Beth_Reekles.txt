### Plot Summary:
At Casa Dorada, a resort in Majorca, friends Luna, Rory, and Jodie embark on a tech-free vacation intended for introspection and personal growth. Rory, struggling with family expectations and her own artistic aspirations, becomes an internet sensation following a viral video named "LobsterFail." This unexpected fame prompts her to reconsider her career path, eventually deciding to pursue her creative ambitions over a law degree, much to the surprise and eventual support of her family.
Jodie, initially seeking to escape the intense pressures of university life, finds herself entangled in a romantic relationship with Gabriel, the resort's charismatic bartender. A misunderstanding concerning derogatory comments threatens their budding romance, but they resolve it, leading to a more profound connection. Gabriel becomes a source of encouragement for Jodie, helping her focus on authenticity, self-empowerment, and ultimately motivating her to pursue what truly matters to her.
Meanwhile, Luna, still reeling from a recent breakup with her boyfriend Liam, finds herself struggling with self-doubt and jealousy, particularly toward her friends. The confrontation with Rory brings Luna to a realization about her priorities—she gains self-awareness and emotional clarity by channeling her newfound independence and focusing on genuine friendships rather than past grievances. Rory aids Luna in creating a pros-and-cons list about her relationship with Liam, helping her recognize she’s better off without him.
Amidst these personal transformations, the vacation becomes a backdrop for resolving individual challenges. Rory learns to embrace her fame constructively, engaging in self-love and artistic expression without the need for external validation. Jodie gains clarity in her romantic life and future aims, choosing to seize opportunities aligned with her true self over societal expectations. With apologies exchanged among the friends, Luna deepens her bond with Rory and Jodie, transforming her fears of losing friendship into resilience and strength.
In this final segment, as they prepare to leave, Gabriel assists the group with their luggage, demonstrating his continued affection for Jodie. Addressing an accumulated tension, Luna takes a stand against Esteban, the hotel manager, for their dissatisfying stay. This newfound assertiveness highlights Luna's growth over the vacation. At the airport, Rory capitalizes on her viral fame to bolster her art brand, with support from Luna and Jodie. Discovering Esteban's role in the video’s viral status brings laughter and camaraderie to the group.
Upon returning home, they express their intent to maintain their strengthened friendship. Rory's family greets her with pride, acknowledging her artistic success. Jodie is met with surprise and warmth as her mother picks her up, indicating family support. Jodie and Gabriel plan to stay in touch, suggesting possible future developments in their relationship.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“No,” I say, pushing my printed confirmation across the counter. “See? I booked hold luggage. It’s right there.”
“I’m sorry, miss, it’s not in our system.”
I gulp. What kind of useless, cheapo airline is this? Well, not that cheapo, since they’re currently trying to charge me again for my supposedly unbooked hold luggage.
My palms are sweating. I hate stuff like this. I hate arguing over stuff like this. If there’s one thing I normally avoid like the plague, it’s confrontation. But I am not paying that money. Liam would’ve dealt with it so well; he was great at stuff like this—especially because he knew I wasn’t.
I get a pang in my chest just thinking about him, and push that feeling deep, deep down. I’ve got the entire week ahead to get my head around that. Right now, I need to deal with the fact that this woman wants to charge me fifty-eight pounds for luggage I’ve already paid twenty-three pounds to put on the plane.
She’s smiling at me as if she’d like to load me onto the conveyor belt just to get rid of me, clearly waiting for me to cave and pay the money.
Come on, Luna. You can do this. You’re almost twenty years old. You’re an adult now, and adults know how to handle these things.
I inhale a deep breath through my nose and tap the paper on the counter. I’m so glad now that Mum insisted I print everything out “just in case.”
“But I paid for it. Look, it’s—it’s right here. Confirmation of payment, see? That’s what it says.”
The woman suppresses a sigh, but gives me a too-wide toothy smile and says, “Let me go find my manager and we’ll get this sorted for you.”
“Thank you,” I say, but I don’t let myself feel relieved yet—I’m already mentally drafting an email of complaint demanding a refund, just in case this all goes south.
(Confrontation is a lot easier on the other side of a screen, after all.)
I remain on tenterhooks, feeling pissed off and more than a little bit tearful until I’ve had the same argument with the woman’s manager, who looks my booking up on the system just to tell me I need to pay the fee, and I try not to lose it as I push my printed email toward her, too. I can hear people in the queue behind me grumbling because I’m causing trouble and taking so long.
Don’t worry, I want to snap at them. The plane won’t leave without you.
Even though I know I’d be doing exactly the same in their position.
And even though I am worried the plane might leave without me at this rate.
