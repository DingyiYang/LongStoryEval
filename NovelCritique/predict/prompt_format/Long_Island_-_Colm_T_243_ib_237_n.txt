### Genres: Historical Fiction, Ireland, Literary Fiction

### Premise:
Eilis Lacey is Irish, married to Tony Fiorello, a plumber and one of four Italian American brothers, all of whom live in neighboring houses on a cul-de-sac in Lindenhurst, Long Island, with their wives and children and Tony’s parents, a huge extended family that lives and works, eats and plays together. It is the spring of 1976 and Eilis, now in her forties with two teenage children, has no one to rely on in this still-new country. Though her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those that hold her to her new land and home, she has not returned in decades.
One day, when Tony is at his job and Eilis is in her home office doing her accounting, an Irishman comes to the door asking for her by name. He tells her that his wife is pregnant with Tony’s child and that when the baby is born, he will not raise it but instead deposit it on Eilis’s doorstep.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
‘That Irishman has been here again,’ Francesca said, sitting down at the kitchen table. ‘He has come to every house, but it’s you he’s looking for. I told him you would be home soon.’
‘What does he want?’ Eilis asked.
‘I did everything to make him tell me, but he wouldn’t. He asked for you by name.’
‘He knows my name?’
Francesca’s smile had an insinuating edge. Eilis appreciated her mother-in-law’s intelligence, and also her sly sense of humour.
‘Another man is the last thing I need,’ Eilis said.
‘Who are you talking to?’ Francesca replied.
They both laughed, as Francesca stood up to go. From the window, Eilis watched her walk carefully across the damp grass to her own house.
Soon, Larry would be in from school and then Rosella from after-school study and then she would hear Tony parking his car outside.
This would be a perfect time for a cigarette. But, having found Larry smoking, she had made a bargain with him that she would give up completely if he promised not to smoke again. She still had a packet upstairs.
When the doorbell rang, Eilis stood up lazily, presuming that it was one of Larry’s cousins calling for him to come and play. However, from the hallway, she made out the silhouette of a grown man through the frosted glass of the door. Until he called out her name, it did not occur to her that this was the man Francesca had mentioned. She opened the door.
‘You are Eilis Fiorello?’
The accent was Irish, with a trace, she thought, of Donegal, like a teacher she had had in school. Also, the way the man stood there, as though waiting to be challenged, reminded her of home.
‘I am,’ she said.
‘I have been looking for you.’
His tone was almost aggressive. She wondered if Tony’s business could owe him money.
‘So I hear.’
‘You are the wife of the plumber?’
Since the question sounded rude, she saw no reason to reply.
‘He is good at his job, your husband. I’d say he’s in great demand.’
The man stopped for a second, looking behind him to check no one was listening.
‘He fixed everything in our house,’ he went on, pointing a finger at her. ‘He even did a bit more than was in the estimate. Indeed, he came back regularly when he knew that the woman of the house would be there and I would not. And his plumbing is so good that she is to have a baby in August.’
He stood back and smiled broadly at her expression of disbelief.
