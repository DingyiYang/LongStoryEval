### Premise:
When Dahlia Weathersby's sister disappears on what should have been a simple day hike, Dahlia immediately heads deep into the Colorado Rockies to find her. Knowing she'll never survive the mountains alone, she convinces the local hermit—adorably grouchy survival expert Winston Dane—to be her guide. All it takes is a good helping of Dahlia's charm...and just the teeniest bit of blackmail...before she's got all six-foot-something of him wrapped around her finger. But even with her very own mountain man in tow, things aren't going to be easy. There are:
Long hikes through gorgeous wilderness? 
Bears? 
A single shared sleeping bag? 
Enough sparks to set the Rockies ablaze? 
With everything the wilderness has to throw at them, it'll take more than charm and some city girl ingenuity to make this trek anything but a disaster waiting to happen...and an adventure she'll never forget.

### Plot Summary:
Dahlia Weathersby embarks on a perilous adventure to rescue her sister, Rose, who has gone missing in the rugged wilderness of Howling Falls, Colorado. Skeptical locals and difficult terrain challenge her quest, but with Winston Dane, a reclusive author with a mysterious past, at her side, they begin a journey that becomes as much about personal discovery and burgeoning romance as it is about locating Rose. Dahlia and Winston’s partnership deepens as they navigate the wild, deciphering clues to Rose's whereabouts from an uncharted map. Winston's military background proves invaluable as they face various physical and emotional trials, fostering trust and emotional connections.
Their journey leads them to a suspicious structure, which they deduce to be linked to illicit drug activities. Surveillance confirms Rose is inside, prompting the duo to conceive a bold rescue plan. With stealth and resourceful tactics, including the use of flammable acetone fumes as a weapon, they overcome obstacles and free Rose. In a narrow escape marred by suspense, the sisters' resourcefulness shines, culminating in an unexpected confrontation with Fletcher, a duplicitous local involved with the criminal activities. Fletcher’s plan is thwarted when Rose incapacitates him, but the escape isn’t without sacrifice—Dahlia is wounded by a gunshot.
In the aftermath, Winston shares his intent to relocate to LA for Dahlia, signifying his profound commitment. The trio's arrival at a ranger station provides a safe pause, where continued revelations and emotional exchanges occur. Rose admits to being targeted for ransom due to their father's wealth.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“Welcome to the Yodel Inn,” said the stocky middle-age Black man. “Where there are no dull moments.”
Dahlia tore her gaze away from her phone, blinking at him. She’d futilely hoped for a response from her sister, but only Dahlia’s twenty-plus frantic outgoing texts filled the screen, the last of which was undelivered due to no cell service. After a night of no sleep, a delayed morning flight, and hours of wandering around the mountains looking for the teeny-tiny town of Howling Falls, she knew she wasn’t at her sharpest, but the odd emphasis gave her pause. “I’m sorry. Did I miss a pun?”
He grimaced. “Yodel, no dull? Supposedly it rhymes.”
“Oh!” Now she felt bad she hadn’t caught it immediately. Normally, she was a huge word-play fan, but it’d been a stressful twentyish or so hours. “It does rhyme—clever!” She tried to make up for her initial lack of enthusiasm, but he still looked mopey.
“I wanted ‘Welcome to Yodel Inn, where yo-delight is our delight,’ but I was outvoted.”
“I do like yours better,” she said, finally taking a moment to glance around the small motel office. It looked like a tiny fake log cabin, but it actually smelled like freshly cut pine, which made her wonder if it wasn’t fake or if they just used a really authentic air freshener. The pun-master and front desk clerk was wearing a red plaid flannel shirt with a name tag proclaiming his name was Bob, and the whole scene made her feel like she’d wandered onto the set of a maple syrup commercial.
“Thank you.” Bob looked a little brighter at her approbation. “Do you have a reservation?”
“I don’t,” she said. “I’m Dahlia Weathersby. My sister, Rose Weathersby, is staying here?” She couldn’t help the lift of her voice that turned an optimistic statement into a question. The Yodel Inn and Tavern was the only lodging in Howling Falls, but relief still flooded over her when the man nodded.
“Yes, she checked in early this week. Would you like a room close to hers?”
Although Dahlia would rather make sure her sister was alive and well and then immediately return to her life in California, she knew she’d need to stay at least one night. The sun had been sinking behind the mountains when she’d finally spotted the “Welcome to Howling Falls” sign. Even if her most optimistic dreams came true and she found Rose chilling in her room at the Yodel Inn, Dahlia would still need a place to sleep, and her sister was a horrible bed hog. Pulling out her driver’s license and a credit card, she slid them across the counter. “Yes, please. Just tonight for now.”
He entered her information, ran her card, and then grabbed a key marked with a nineteen off a nail on the wall. She noted that the only missing keys were two, six, and seventeen.
