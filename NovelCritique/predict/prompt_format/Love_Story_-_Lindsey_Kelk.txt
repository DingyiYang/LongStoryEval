### Plot Summary:
Sophie Taylor leads a double life, serving as a primary school teacher and secretly writing bestselling romance novels under the pen name Este Cox. Her dual life comes under scrutiny during a weekend trip to Harford to celebrate her father Hugh’s sixtieth birthday. This becomes a pivotal moment as Sophie's fear of her mother Pandora’s disapproval of romance literature comes to a head. Sophie struggles with jealousy from her ex-boyfriend CJ, who tries to expose her secrecy, and with growing romantic feelings for her creative director, Joe Walsh. Their relationship becomes even more complicated when Joe masquerades as Este Cox.
Sophie’s personal revelation and public declaration of her identity at her father's party challenge familial expectations and societal norms. Joe's ambiguous intentions and reluctance to fully commit add tension to their relationship, culminating in a passionate night together and unresolved issues. Amid the celebrations, Sophie publicly confronts her identity, spurred by CJ's jealousy, leading to both family and public acceptance. The exposure becomes transformative, confronts expectations, and paves the way for her self-acceptance.
Following the party, Joe and Sophie navigate their feelings, agreeing to keep their relationship secret until Joe’s father Gregory reveals Joe is married to a New York-based editor. Feeling betrayed, Sophie ends the relationship and retreats to her family, grappling with personal and professional disillusionment.
Sophie, with her siblings Charlotte and William, embarks on a road trip back, strengthening family bonds. Charlotte’s accidental video leak of Sophie’s confession leads to widespread attention online, prompting Sophie to embrace her identity as Este Cox. This acceptance, alongside familial support, offers new hope for her future, despite her disillusionment with Joe's betrayal.
Three months later, Sophie is at the forefront of her public book signing. Her sister Charlotte thrives, leveraging the viral success of Sophie’s reveal to further her bookstore business. Joe unexpectedly arrives, revealing that his marriage was one of convenience. Despite past hurts, Joe confesses his love for Sophie, claiming he'd been thinking of her incessantly. Initially resistant, Sophie eventually forgives Joe, acknowledging the deep bond they share, agreeing to another chance at their relationship. In coming to terms with her complex identity and relationships, Sophie’s transformation from a secret writer to a celebrated author marks her journey of personal growth and acceptance.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
‘Romance novels are so hot right now.’
I looked up at Malcolm, both my cheeks hamster-full of lamb biriyani and nodded.
‘Gen Z can’t get enough,’ he said, digging through his lunch with vigour. ‘They’re out there this very second, inhaling them, tearing through books like locusts! They can’t get enough. They’re insatiable.’
It wasn’t a particularly appealing visual, thousands of young women swarming around their local Waterstones, devouring everything on the ‘as seen on TikTok’ table. I poked sadly at my lunch having suddenly lost my appetite.
‘And your bloody book.’ Mal pointed at me with a chunk of tandoori chicken, the tines of his fork shining through the neon red meat. ‘Soph, I’ve never seen anything like it.’
‘Well—’
‘It’s unprecedented!’ My publisher interrupted before I could even get started. ‘We can’t keep the book in stock, the audio and the ebook are outselling everything else in the industry and for the love of god, don’t tell anyone this, but we’ve had to “borrow” some of the paper assigned to a very famous author’s print run, just to keep the supermarkets stocked. And believe you me, he wouldn’t be happy if he heard about it.’
‘I bet,’ I replied.
‘I can’t tell you who it is.’
‘Then don’t.’
‘I wish I could.’
‘I don’t want to know.’
He looked around the quiet Indian restaurant I’d chosen for lunch and mouthed the name of an unbelievably successful, notoriously humourless, male literary author before slapping both of his hands against his cheeks, Home Alone-style.
No pressure there then.
‘Oh,’ I replied weakly. ‘That’s nuts.’
‘Too bloody right it’s nuts,’ Mal said, reaching for his second icy cold Kingfisher. ‘Which is why I need to know when I’m getting the sequel.’
‘Right.’ I reached for my glass of water, took a gulp then forced a smile. ‘The thing is—’
‘And I don’t want any excuses. “It needs one more read-through, I’m not happy with the ending, I’ve been busy at work”, I’ve heard them all before, Soph.’
‘In fairness, you haven’t given me a chance to say anything, have you?’ I pointed out, dropping the smile. ‘I don’t think I’ve finished a sentence since we sat down.’
He looked at his empty plate.
‘Then how come I’ve almost finished my lunch and you’ve barely touched yours?’
‘Because you talk with your mouth full and it’s disgusting. Besides, they’re not excuses. I know it’s not what you want to hear but it does need one more read-through, I’m not happy with the ending and I have been busy at work.’
The look on Malcolm’s face was not a happy one.
‘Butterflies has only been out six weeks and it is already one of the top ten fastest-selling debuts MullinsParker has ever seen,’ he replied. ‘You’re a Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller, a Reese’s Book Club pick, a Book of the Month, you’ve already got translation deals for twenty-nine languages—’
‘Thirty-two,’ I corrected quietly.
