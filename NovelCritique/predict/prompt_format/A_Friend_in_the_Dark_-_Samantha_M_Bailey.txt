### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
I’m sick of being the good girl.
But I don’t know who I’m supposed to be. I’m no longer a wife, since Dave asked me for a divorce six weeks ago in the parking lot at the University of Michigan, our alma mater, mere minutes after we’d said goodbye to Ava for the start of her freshman year. And with no child to care for at home anymore, I don’t feel like much of a mother.
I’m in agony, and I can’t tell if it’s from heartburn or heartache. Instead of making a wish, eating red-velvet cheesecake, and opening meaningful gifts, I’m alone and drunk on my forty-fifth birthday in my pitch-dark living room, with only an empty bottle of prosecco and my phone for company.
The sparkling wine was a gift from Jenna and Natalie, my closest girlfriends since we met at U-M in sophomore year. I’d burst into tears in the middle of an introductory psychology class because I’d received a C on our midterm. They’d taken me outside and hugged me until I stopped crying. The three of us couldn’t have been more different: Jenna, loud and unfiltered; Natalie, self-assured and protective; and sensible, agreeable me, who never wanted to disappoint anyone, especially my parents, both professors, who I knew would be furious that I’d almost flunked an exam.
Even though my parents passed away two years ago, I still don’t want to disappoint them. My broken family is the first thing I’ve ever actually failed at, and a hug from Jenna and Natalie can’t make it better.
They tried to drag me out tonight to celebrate, but I don’t want them to see me like this—a miserable, pathetic mess of a woman who should be in the prime of her life.
I don’t deserve to feel this bad. I’m not the one who tore our family to shreds. I didn’t see the end of us coming at all.
“I’m not who you need me to be, Eden. I’m so sorry. You deserve better,” Dave whispered raggedly in that parking lot as we stood between our cars, which only a few hours earlier we’d packed up with Ava’s things, following his carefully designed guide of what should go where. Dave’s been the most efficient packer since we moved from Ann Arbor to Grosse Pointe twenty-three years ago.
The bedding and all Ava’s clothes were stuffed in my blue Camry. In Dave’s gray Range Rover went Ava’s guitar, books, and posters, and of course, our daughter drove with her father. Even an hour alone with her mother was apparently too much for Ava. Twenty years of marriage was clearly enough for Dave, who, like his daughter, seems to think I have standards that are too high for everyone to meet.
