### Premise:
Mark Chan this. Mark Chan that. 
Writer and barista Emily Hung is tired of hearing about the great Mark Chan, the son of her parents’ friends. You’d think he single-handedly stopped climate change and ended child poverty from the way her mother raves about him. But in reality, he’s just a boring, sweater-vest-wearing engineer, and when they’re forced together at Emily’s sister’s wedding, it’s obvious he thinks he’s too good for her. 
But now that Emily is her family’s last single daughter, her mother is fixated on getting her married and she has her sights on Mark. There’s only one solution, clearly : convince Mark to be in a fake relationship with her long enough to put an end to her mom’s meddling. He reluctantly agrees.
Unfortunately, lying isn’t enough. Family friends keep popping up at their supposed dates—including a bubble tea shop and cake-decorating class—so they’ll have to spend more time together to make their relationship look real. With each fake date, though, Emily realizes that Mark’s not quite what she assumed and maybe that argyle sweater isn’t so ugly after all...

### Plot Summary:
Emily Hung, a 33-year-old Toronto-based author, enters a fake relationship with computer engineer Mark Chan to counter familial pressures for marriage, most notably from her mother, Judy. Initially, this arrangement serves to appease parental expectations, but it gradually morphs into a genuine connection. During a family trip, Emily realizes the depth of their relationship as Mark effortlessly bonds with her nieces, allowing her to focus on her writing. Despite her growing affection for Mark, Emily faces professional anxieties, from uncertainties with potential book adaptations to shifts in the publishing industry, which contribute to her insomnia.
The authenticity of their relationship is tested when Emily's growing distance raises Mark's doubts, especially after their faux relationship's origins are revealed at a family gathering, leading to tension. Emily faces criticism from her conventionally minded sister, Allison, complicating her journey towards authenticity. However, she ultimately recognizes her genuine feelings for Mark, who becomes a cornerstone of emotional support.
A significant revelation comes when Emily learns from Judy that the matchmaking was motivated by a desire to ensure Emily has a stable partner to support her career. This realization, along with the discovery of her grandfather's literary aspirations, reshapes Emily’s understanding of her familial dynamics. Returning to Toronto, Emily navigates personal relationships and emotional challenges, including a candid conversation with Allison that uncovers shared vulnerabilities and a revealing moment with her friend Ashley, who faces life-altering changes, thereby creating a supportive network among friends.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in her thirties—especially one with four married sisters—must be in want of a wedding of her own, even if she claims otherwise. And her family should do everything in their power to secure a match for her.”
—My mother, probably
How old are you, Auntie Emily?” my little niece Scarlett demands.
I take a healthy swallow of my drink and crouch down in my bridesmaid dress to get closer to her. Cocktail hour is in full swing, and it’s a bit loud in this small room at the banquet hall. “I’m thirty-three.”
“Thirty-three? That’s so old!” She sounds positively horrified. I guess being over thirty is incomprehensible to her. “You’re not married, are you?”
“No.”
“You should get married so I can be a flower girl at your wedding.”
My littlest sister, Hannah, got married today, and Scarlett was a flower girl, a role she enjoyed very much.
“I’ll be sure to keep that in mind,” I say.
I totally expected to get hassled about my marital status at Hannah’s wedding, seeing as I’m now the last single Hung sister; I just didn’t expect it to come from a five-year-old.
Not only am I the last single one in the family, but I’m also the second oldest, which makes it even worse in everyone’s eyes. I have three younger sisters who have now tied the knot. I’m way behind.
It’s fine with me. It really is. Not because I’m against marriage, but because I have different priorities in my life. Dreams that are finally coming to fruition.
It is not, however, fine with my mother.
Mom and Allison—Scarlett’s mother and my older sister—head toward us, glasses of wine in hand.
“Mommy,” Scarlett says, “Auntie Emily is thirty-three!”
Allison chuckles. “And do you know what? I’m thirty-five.”
Scarlett’s mouth falls open.
Allison seems amused by this whole interaction. My big sister is often annoyed with me for one reason or another, but not today.
Mom is less amused. She takes my arm and leads me away, probably to meet some eligible bachelor.
“Can’t you just enjoy the reception, rather than attempting more matchmaking?” I ask.
Mom clucks her tongue. “What would be the fun in that?”
Inwardly, I groan.
“A wedding is the perfect place to meet men,” she says, steering us with ease through the crowds of people at the reception. “Ah, I see Mark Chan.”
I stop walking. “Tell me you didn’t.”
“Didn’t what?” Mom asks innocently.
“Invite Mark Chan to the wedding. It’s not like he even knows Hannah.”
“Why shouldn’t I have invited Mark?” Mom asks. “His parents are friends of ours and he’s an engineer who—”
“What does his profession have to do with why he should be at Hannah’s wedding?”
