### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
I know I shouldn’t leave her. She is across the room, blond hair swinging. Hips shimmying. I imagine her on the trail, her brow furrowed as she peruses a map. Her hands calloused and steady on the sandstone walls of a canyon. The Katie I know is missing. This Katie is different. Giggly. Bouncy. Drunk.
This party reminds me of a kicked anthill, bodies swarming and frantic. Girls in laughably high heels. Boys in baseball hats and unbuttoned flannels. Half-empty plastic cups on sticky kitchen counters. Inane conversations swallow up every inch of air that isn’t already permeated with the endless thump thump thump of club music. The tiny bathroom is the only reasonably quiet and empty space here. I’d know, because I’ve spent half my time in there, gripping the sink and staring at my reflection.
I debate a return trip. Third time, and I haven’t needed to pee once. But that’s not really what I want to do. I want to walk out of this loud, nasty college apartment and never look back. A Nerf football whizzes through the living room, inches from my face. A peal of laughter rises over the music. My stomach squirms. I hate every single thing about this night.
Katie is still in the corner. Dancing with her hands up over her head with a tall boy I do not know. Not that I know any boy here. Or any person, for that matter. I only know Katie. She’s the reason I’m here. Said it would be fun if I wanted to come along. She did not tell me to stay, but I know it’s the right thing to do.
Too bad my feet don’t give a damn about what’s right.
They help me push up off the stained couch. Standing is even worse for a moment, with all these people. All these bodies. And the music. The bass line that has crawled under my skin and hammered at my ears since we walked in here an hour ago.
Another laugh, shrill, bright, and familiar.
Katie.
She is no longer dancing. She is leaned against the wall, her smile a remnant of the laughter I just heard. The red plastic cup in her hand tilts precariously. There is a small group around her, three boys and another girl, and Katie is smiling and smiling. She looks okay. I think she is okay.
“Where’s your drink, girlie?”
I turn and assess the speaker. Male. Twenty-ish with a mop of messy brown hair and an aw shucks grin beaming above his Vineyard Vines polo. He’s definitely talking to me. My hands curl into fists, but I keep the irritation off my face. Manners first.
“I could get you a drink,” he offers. “If you’re shy.”
“No. I’m fine.” I look away, remembering a quick, “Thanks though.”
