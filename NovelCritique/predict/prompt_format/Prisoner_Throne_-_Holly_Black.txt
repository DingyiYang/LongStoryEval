### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
SIX WEEKS BEFORE IMPRISONMENT
Oak jammed his hooves into velvet pants.
“Have I made you late?” Lady Elaine asked from the bed, her voice full of wicked satisfaction. She propped up her head with an elbow and gave a little laugh. “It won’t be too much longer before you don’t have to do anything at their beck and call.”
“Yes,” Oak said, distracted. “Only yours, right?”
She laughed again.
Doublet only half-buttoned, he tried desperately to remember the fastest route to the gardens. He’d meant to be punctual, but then the opportunity to finally see the scope of the treasonous plot he’d been pursuing had presented itself.
I promise I will introduce you to the rest of my associates, she’d told him, her fingers sliding beneath his shirt, untucking it. You will be impressed with how close to the throne we can get. . . .
Cursing himself, the sky, and the concept of time in general, Oak raced out the door.
“Hurry, you scamp,” one of the palace laundresses called after him. “It will look ill if they begin without you. And fix your hair!”
He tried to smooth down his curls as servants veered out of his way. In the palace of Elfhame, no matter how tall he grew, Oak was forever the mischievous, wild-haired boy who coaxed guards into playing conkers with horse chestnuts and stole honey cakes from the kitchens. Faerie caught its inhabitants in amber, so if they were not careful, a hundred years might pass in the lazy blink of an eye. And so, few noticed how much the prince had changed.
Not that he didn’t resemble his younger self right then, pelting down another corridor, hooves clattering against stone. He dodged left to avoid running into a page with an armful of scrolls, wove right so as not to knock over a small table with an entire tea tray atop it, then almost slammed into Randalin, an elderly member of the Living Council.
By the time he made it to the gardens, Oak was out of breath. Panting, he took in the garlands of Bowers and musicians, the courtiers and revelers. No High King or Queen yet. That meant he had a chance to make his way to the front with no one the wiser.
But before he could slip into the crowd, his mother, Oriana, grabbed hold of his sleeve. Her expression was stern, and since her skin was usually ghostly white, it was easy to see the Bush of anger in her cheeks. It pinked them so they matched the rosy color of her eyes.
“Where have you been?” Her fingers went to Oak’s doublet, fixing his buttons.
“I lost track of time,” he admitted.
“Doing what?” She dusted off the velvet. Then she licked her finger and rubbed a smudge on Oak’s nose.
