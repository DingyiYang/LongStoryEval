### Plot Summary:
The story intricately weaves together the lives of Emilia Bassano, a determined poet in 17th-century England, and Melina Green, a contemporary playwright fighting for recognition in the modern theater world. Emilia's tale unfolds as she strives to forge her own literary path amidst the restrictive societal norms of her time. This pursuit is marked by her efforts to claim her inheritance and manage a nuanced relationship with the Earl of Southampton, all while desiring recognition separate from William Shakespeare’s towering presence. After Shakespeare's death, Emilia continues her mission as a schoolmistress, nurturing young female minds and confronting societal barriers. A pivotal moment arises when Ben Jonson discloses that Shakespeare credited her inspiration for his work, allowing her to contribute significantly to the legacy of Shakespeare's plays, including revisions to "Othello."
Parallelly, Melina Green navigates the modern world of theater in Washington Heights, adopting the pseudonym "Mel Green" to surmount gender bias. Her play, "By Any Other Name," gains traction under her friend Andre’s identity, leading to complications within their friendship. Inspired by Emilia’s journey, Melina pursues recognition, balancing professional relationships and personal reconciliation with Andre. A career-defining opportunity arises when Jasper Tolle, now an artistic director supportive of diverse voices, opts to stage Melina's play, marking a turning point in her career and renewing her aspirations.
The story culminates with the play’s opening night, a testament to Melina’s growth and triumph. As the play concludes, Melina reflects on the profound, transient pause before audience applause, confirming their collective journey. Supported by a dedicated cast, Andre, and family, including her father who is moved by the play’s dedication to Melina’s mother, she steps onto the stage amidst the ovation.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Many years after Melina graduated from Bard College, the course she remembered the most was not a playwriting seminar or a theater intensive but an anthropology class. One day, the professor had flashed a slide of a bone with twenty-nine tiny incisions on one long side. “The Lebombo bone was found in a cave in Swaziland in the 1970s and is about forty-three thousand years old,” she had said. “It’s made of a baboon fibula. For years, it’s been the first calendar attributed to man. But I ask you: what man uses a twenty-nine-day calendar?” The professor seemed to stare directly at Melina. “History,” she said, “is written by those in power.”
He was standing with his back to her when she knocked and entered. His silver hair fell over his eyes, boyish. “My favorite thesis student,” he greeted.
“I’m your only thesis student.” Melina pulled an elastic from her wrist and balled her black hair on top of her head in a loose knot before rummaging in her backpack for two small glass bottles of chocolate milk from a local dairy. They cost a fortune, but she brought Professor Bufort one each week. High blood pressure medication had robbed him of his previous vices—alcohol and cigarettes—and he joked that this was the only fun he got to have anymore. Melina handed him a bottle and clinked hers against it.
“My savior,” he said, taking a long drink.
Like most high school kids who had notched productions of The Crucible and A Midsummer Night’s Dream on their belts, Melina had come to Bard assuming that she would study acting. It wasn’t until she took a playwriting course that she realized the only thing mightier than giving a stellar performance was being the person who crafted the words an actor spoke. She started writing one-acts that were performed by student groups. She studied Molière and Mamet, Marlowe and Miller. She took apart the language and the structure of their plays with the intensity of a grandmaster chess champion whose understanding of the game determined success.
She wrote a modern Pygmalion, where the sculptor was a pageant mom and the statue was JonBenét Ramsey, but it was her version of Waiting for Godot, set at a political convention where all the characters were awaiting a savior-like presidential candidate who never arrived, that caught the attention of Professor Bufort. He encouraged her to send her play to various open-submission festivals, and although she never was selected, it was clear to Melina and everyone else in the department that she was going to be one of the few to make it as a produced playwright.
“Melina,” Bufort asked, “what are you going to do after graduation?”
