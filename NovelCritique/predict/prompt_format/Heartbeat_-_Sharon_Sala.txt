### Plot Summary:
In Jubilee, Kentucky, Amalie Lincoln, a perceptive CPA, navigates complex personal and familial challenges. After overcoming the sinister plots orchestrated by Fiona Rangely, Wolf Outen’s manipulative second wife, Amalie reunites with her father, Wolf, a wealthy businessman entangled in a criminal network revealed through a helicopter crash near an elementary school. This incident exposes a conspiracy targeting Wolf but ultimately strengthens familial bonds between Amalie, Wolf, and Sean Pope, her childhood friend who becomes her protector.
Fiona’s criminal empire crumbles, leading to her demise during a prison riot, allowing Amalie and Sean's relationship to flourish. Engaged on Valentine's Day, Amalie finds a sense of belonging with Sean and the Pope family while connecting with her identity and community in Jubilee. Spiritual foresight from family elder Ella Pope weaves insights into the narrative, enriching the journey toward justice and familial unity as Wolf confronts past traumas. This involves taking a stand against the Bullocks—Amalie's biological grandparents—revealing their part in her kidnapping 28 years ago.
Following these discoveries, Wolf, supported by Detective Louis Giraud, exposes the Bullocks’ criminal past, acting against the initial denial and gathering evidence leading to their arrest. The Bullocks’ incarceration ensures justice for Amalie—their DNA evidence confirming her identity—significantly restoring her family's honor. Contradicting suggestions to maintain secrecy, Wolf utilizes media attention to reveal the truth, underscoring justice and redemption amid chaos.
As order restores, light-hearted moments arise; tensions give way to family growth, reflecting in occasions like BJ’s return to Jubilee with culinary ambitions as a pastry chef. The Pope family’s life is punctuated by significant events, including weddings and communal gatherings that foster healing and restore balance in Amalie’s life. Her transition from trauma to acceptance underlines the family’s resilience.
The wedding of Amalie and Sean becomes a focal point, embodying unity, celebration, and continuity of family heritage. With heartfelt moments like Ella walking down the aisle and Mikey Pope, the ring bearer, escorted by a dog, Ghost, humor and sentiment intermingle vividly. The reception showcases a fairy-tale theme orchestrated by Wolf and executed by Liz Caldwell, symbolizing the fusion of past dreams and present realities.
In the culmination of the narrative, Amalie and Sean, newlyweds, find joy and solace in their love, symbolizing new beginnings, underpinned by loyalty and familial bonds. This journey, rich in justice, love, and healing, ends on a hopeful note for Amalie, Sean, and their extended family.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The day was new, and the sun was in Amalie Lincoln’s eyes.
She was driving eastbound on the Tulsa Crosstown Expressway, coming up on a pretzel loop of rebar and concrete, also known as the Interstate 244 and Highway 169 junction, when her very normal day turned into chaos.
Suddenly, the car a few yards in front of her swerved, overcorrected, spun sideways, then overcorrected again, and broadsided Amalie’s car. It sent her into a spin before hitting her again, then slamming her car into a concrete abutment. When everything finally came to a stop, the ensuing pileup had traffic at a standstill.
Amalie was dazed, bleeding, and trying to unbuckle her seat belt when her car suddenly burst into flames.
“No, no, no,!” she cried, then began screaming for help, still trying to unbuckle her seat belt as smoke rolled up around her.
She kept screaming and screaming, trying to open the door even as the first fingers of fire were licking at the legs of her slacks, then the arm of her jacket, when all of a sudden, the door came open! She could hear voices shouting, and the whoosh and hiss of fire extinguishers, and then some man’s voice in her ear, telling her, “I got you, lady. I got you,” and a voice whispering inside her head…You’re going to be okay.
Then everything went black.
The time afterward was a blur. Amalie went from an emergency room to a burn unit in Hillcrest Medical Center and ensuing days and nights of living hell. Time was measured by recurring debridement, the administration of pain meds, and wrapping and unwrapping the burns, and complete isolation.
It was a week before Dan Worthy, her across-the-hall neighbor in her apartment building learned what had happened to her.
He was an accident lawyer. He knew she had no family and called the burn unit, asked a nurse to deliver a message to her, and said he’d wait for the answer.
The nurse listened, wrote down what Dan Worthy said, and headed for Amalie’s room, gowned up, then moved to the side of Amalie’s bed.
“Amalie, can you hear me?”
Amalie moaned, opened her eyes, and then nodded.
“Do you know a man named Dan Worthy?”
“Neighbor,” Amalie said.
“He says he’s an accident lawyer. Is this so?”
Amalie blinked. “Yes.”
“He says he just heard about what happened to you, and if you say the word, then he’s going to sue the pants off the drunk who hit you.”
Amalie chuckled, but tears were rolling.
“Tell him yes and thank you.”
“Consider it done,” the nurse said. “Oh, and by the way, your next round of pain meds are on the way.”
Tears were still rolling when Amalie closed her eyes.
The nurse went back to the phone. “Mr. Worthy, are you still there?”
“Yes, ma’am. What’s the verdict?”
“She says, ‘Yes and thank you.’”
“Awesome,” Dan said and disconnected.
