### Title: Three Kinds of Lucky

### Genres: Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal

### Premise:
Petra Grady has known since adolescence that she has no talent for magic—and that’s never going to change. But as a sweeper first-class, she’s parlayed her rare ability to handle dross—the damaging, magical waste generated by her more talented kin’s spellwork—into a decent life working at the mages’ university.
Except Grady’s relatively predictable life is about to be upended. When the oblivious, sexy, and oh-so-out-of-reach Benedict Strom needs someone with her abilities for a research project studying dross and how to render it harmless, she’s stuck working on his team—whether she wants to or not.
Only Benedict doesn’t understand the characteristics of dross like Grady does. After an unthinkable accident, she and Benedict are forced to go on the run to seek out the one person who might be able to help: an outcast exiled ten years ago for the crime of using dross to cast spells. Now Grady must decide whether to stick with the magical status quo or embrace her own hidden talents . . . and risk shattering their entire world.

### Plot Summary:
In the magical chaos of St. Unoc, Petra Grady’s journey from being a pragmatic sweeper to an empowered shadow weaver unfolds amid the city's lockdown due to Benedict Strom's dangerous magical experiments. As Petra explores her latent powers connected to her father's mysterious lineage, she must navigate complicated loyalties and conflicts of interest.
In the midst of her evolving mastery of magic, an incident at a ruined auditorium forces Petra to engage with separatists led by Ashley, who harbors conflicting ideals about using dross to control the magical factions, testing Petra’s loyalties and ethics. As battles ignite across the city, Petra’s relationship with Pluck, her shadow-dog, grows deeper, reflecting her understanding of shadow magic. Despite injuries sustained in the crossfire, and the complex web of adversities, Petra unravels the feral shadows' power and learns to wield her new abilities effectively.
With the help of the diligent yet shadowy informant Lev, Petra negotiates her role with Master Ranger Nodal, who leads the military's efforts to manage the city's magical turmoil. Her reluctant integration into the militia's hierarchy is sealed by an ultimatum to confront separatists, leaving her entwined with allies like Herm and Benedict.
In an attempt to restore the city's equilibrium amid rising tensions, Petra orchestrates a daring rescue of Benedict and Herm from the separatists’ control. Their incarceration complicates her mission further, but Petra's wits and growing dominance over shadow magic facilitate her allies’ release, despite fierce opposition and the city's backdrop in ruins swelling with magical conflict.
In this climactic segment, Petra confronts a feral shadow threatening to engulf her psyche. Standing at the brink of exhaustion, the desert shadows, relics of shadow magic's history and balance, intercede to defuse the menace. Their united strength subdues the unruly shadow, enabling Petra to fulfill her promise to find them new weavers.
As shadows of the past align with her future, Petra’s resolve takes shape, setting her on a path to confront her role and responsibilities as an emergent shadow weaver. Her future mission unfolds as Lev announces an urgent task in Detroit concerning separatists who have gone rogue. Faced with nurturing fragile hopes and confronting ominous threats, Petra's pivotal choices determine the world’s magical landscape's future course.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
I leaned into the turn, bike tires humming until the pavement roughened and my smooth ride dissolved into a rumble, unheard but felt as NIN blared in my earbuds. The mirror attached to the handlebar was less than helpful with the vibrations, but traffic had stopped and I slowed, feeling the afternoon heat from the street as I scanned the commuter cars, their windows up and air-conditioning on. My spandex kit emblazoned with a nonexistent bike-messenger service gave me some slack, but I’d had enough near misses with doors to be wary.
That’s why the helmet and skidproof gloves. Both had the sweepers’ triangle logo on them, as did my backpack and water bottle strapped to the bike frame. So did the blueprint tube over my shoulder, the metal tube heavily stickered with grunge and alternative rock bands.
Reason one for a bike, I thought as I rolled past the cars. Here outside the university campus, the low, squat buildings did little to hide the late sun, and I squinted as I found the intersection. The light changed before I got there, and after making eye contact with the driver on my left, I jammed on the pedals in time with the hard beat in my ears to cross the street.
I kept up with traffic, muscles moving smoothly as I watched the street and sidewalk in a familiar pattern of defense. My gaze, though, kept returning to a glinting shimmer half a block up. It looked like a heat mirage and I stifled a call of warning when a woman stepped right into the hazy glow and picked it up like dog doo. Immediately she tripped on the sidewalk—and the distortion of dross clinging to her heel was gone, used up in a flash of bad luck.
Two doors away, a more certain gleam lurked under a painter’s scaffold. The shimmer was unseen by nearly the entire world’s population, oblivious as they walked through it to snag wisps of dross and carry them over the entire city. A tiny half percent had some sense that it was there, and an even smaller fraction, like me, could actually do something about it.
The city of St. Unoc just east of Tucson had one of the highest percentages of magic users this side of the Mississippi, bringing the usual ratio of one in a thousand to more like eight out of ten. The ratio at our closed campus, named after the small city, was even higher. But that was what made St. Unoc University special—and my job essential to keeping the silence of our existence.
