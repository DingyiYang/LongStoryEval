### Premise:
Julia White is struggling: her bartending job isn’t cutting it and her first book has sold hardly any copies. She’s broke, barely able to make ends meet while drowning in her late mother’s medical bills and reeling after a one-night stand with her ex-boyfriend, who’s now completely ghosted her. Enter Johnathan Aster, world-renowned photographer, with a proposal: he has a never-before-seen photograph of a woman falling from a train bridge, clutching what appears to be a baby. And he wants Julia to research the story.
Alternating between present-day Brooklyn and Kentucky as it enters the 1960s, the story unfolds as Julia races to find answers: Who was the woman in the photograph? Why was she on the bridge? And what happened to the baby? Each detail is more propulsive than the last as Julia unravels the mystery surrounding the Fairchilds of Gray Station and discovers a story more staggering than anything she could have imagined.

### Plot Summary:
Julia "Jules" White embarks on a journey through her family’s complex history, uncovering deep secrets rooted in Western Kentucky. Her path parallels the tragic life of her grandmother, Kathryn Fairchild, in the 1960s—a woman besieged by societal norms and personal trauma. Jules’ investigation reveals how Kathryn suffered under the oppressive influence of George Caldwell, who raped her and forced her into unwanted motherhood. As an unmarried pregnant woman, Kathryn faced enormous pressure from the powerful Caldwell family to give up her child. Defiant, Kathryn concocted a clever ruse to fake her and her child's deaths, employing the help of her friend Jack Chandler to smuggle her baby to safety in New York.
In the present, Jules, who finds herself pregnant by Ryan, a married man reluctant to accept responsibility, feels an uncanny connection to her grandmother's plight. Supported by Kyle—a companion with a troubled past of his own—Jules becomes determined to piece together Kathryn's legacy. Her exploration in Gray Station uncovers a narrative rich with deception, survival, and resilience, binding her to her family's past. In a significant revelation from Aster (Jack Chandler), Jules learns the truth about her ancestry, opening her eyes to the real foundation of her mother's strength and changing her perception of her lineage.
Julia's research transforms into a book, "Woman Saves Child," marking a significant chapter in her life. At a Manhattan art gallery, Julia presents this book alongside Aster's photograph of Kathryn Fairchild—the woman who saved her grandmother, linking past and present. Witnessing the unveil is her daughter, Katie, symbolizing new beginnings. The narrative constructs a bridge between Kathryn’s sacrificial defiance and Jules’ modern-day challenges, underscoring themes of feminine resilience against suffocating societal constraints.
Jules evolves by embracing her family's legacy, determined to provide Katie with a connected sense of identity. As she delicately balances her emotions—grief over her mother's death and struggles with Ryan's inconstancy—she draws strength from newfound kinships. Despite ambiguous relationships, such as her undefined connection with Kyle, Julia perseveres. She dreams of giving her daughter what she never had—a relationship with her father—a responsibility her own mother mourned.
Reflecting on the multigenerational saga, Jules recognizes the eternal trials women face, their struggle for autonomy, and the cyclical nature of history. Standing in the gallery enveloped by both crowd and personal specters, she is united with her child and newfound family—a testament to how she has transformed her ancestor’s struggles into a beacon for the future.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
A dead body is a haunting thing. Every time I close my eyes, the onslaught of memory: blue-white skin and twisted limbs, bulbous eyes, and purple lips—my mom’s corpse lying stiff in her Poughkeepsie apartment, an empty pill bottle atop the note on her nightstand. Most days I can forget. But today, on the three-year anniversary of her death, the swell of grief crushes my ribs, an inflating balloon that refuses to burst.
Right now, I need my mom more than ever. I’ve been on mental health leave from work for the past few weeks, but now I’m back at the Sundowner bar in Brooklyn. Inside, the blue-black darkness is a salve against the hard light of the city. An hour into my shift I have stirred myself into negronis and Manhattans, shaken my regrets into gimlets and margaritas. Then some guy sporting an ironic fedora orders a dirty martini—Ryan’s drink. I reach for the olive brine, but it’s too much. Pinprick sweat gathers at my temples. I rush to the closet-sized bathroom behind the bar before my knees give out. Kneeling on the filthy terracotta floor tiles, I retch out the remnants of a blackberry smoothie, seedy and blood-purple. I wipe the seat of the toilet with a paper towel, rinse my mouth, check my mascara. As soon as I get back to the bar, Myra pulls me aside, tucks my hair behind my ear.
“Jules, honey, you don’t have to be here,” she says. Her voice holds the authority of a bar manager and the concern of a roommate. She’s both, so it works.
“Of course I do.” I can barely afford to eat, let alone help Myra pay the rent. Sure, our little Crown Heights studio is Brooklyn cheap, but it’s still Brooklyn.
“Look at me, babe.” Myra tilts my chin, catches my eyes. “It’s okay if you’re not ready. Give yourself time.” The jaundice glow of the bar cuts across her skin, splitting her into shadow and light. The silhouetted hook of her nose, the curvature of her ear—my brain morphs her face into a mirage of Ryan. I try to edge past her, but she won’t budge.
“I can’t—” I start, but I don’t know what comes next.
Myra pulls me into her, kisses my forehead. “We’ll talk about it later. If you insist on staying, then get that guy another old-fashioned.” She nods toward an old man sitting alone in my favorite corner of the bar—the dead zone where you can drink in the shadows, hiding from the incessant hum of electric light.
I serve the old-fashioned but don’t say anything—nobody chooses to sit in the dead zone if they want to make small talk. By the time I come back to the other side of the counter, two emo-looking dudes are whisper-yelling about something.
“I swear to God, that has to be him,” one of them says. His lip piercing is infected—cherry red, encrusted. My stomach lurches.
