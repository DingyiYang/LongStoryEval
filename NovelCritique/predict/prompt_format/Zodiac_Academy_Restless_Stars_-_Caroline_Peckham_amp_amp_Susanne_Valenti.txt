All souls are at risk now and when the final battle dawns, a new regime will rise. The time for the true reckoning is upon us and we have proven ourselves as savage as our father, as brutal as our mother, and as wild as the Elements which roar through our veins.

And our destiny rides upon our shoulders as we rush into the end. All hail the True Queens. May our rule last longer than this night.

Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride***

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The air thundered with expectant energy and the stars in the sky seemed to ring out a single, beautiful note of music that made me want to weep.
I wasn’t sure what was happening as the twins were lost to the ethereal light that had burst from the sky, so bright it was blinding to look at. I did know one thing though; the stars were here among this celestial magic, and it felt like the ghosts of the dead were watching on too, witnessing the tune of fate changing forever with the ascension of our new queens. They may not have sat upon their rightful throne yet, but there was no denying the power of the sons and daughters of the most powerful Fae in Solaria bowing at their feet.
Tyler’s hand was fisted in my shirt, and my face was wet with glittering tears. My gaze moved to the one entity among the chaos which was sturdier than the ground beneath me. My brother kneeling there, his back to me now but there had been no refuting his existence when he had stepped through the crowd. It had to be a gift of the stars, allowing him a moment back here on earth, but his time could already be waning.
Everyone began to rise to their feet, and I leapt upright too, nudging Tyler back before charging toward my brother. Sofia neighed hopefully as I ran through the crowd, shoving people aside to get closer as everyone clamoured to get a look at the Heirs. My heart thundered chaotically, and my mind twisted around so many unanswered questions, I couldn’t count them. I just had to see him. Had to look him in the eye and find what my soul was yearning for most. A precious moment with my lost brother.
The Heirs were rising to their feet, and Caleb yanked Darius into his arms while Max fell on them next. Seth leapt onto Max’s back so he could lean over and bury his face into the middle of them, kissing Darius on the forehead. There was a thrum of excitement, a surge of the onlookers pushing to get closer to try and see the fallen Heir. But I was owed it most.
Panic flooded my chest as I moved faster, shoving people aside with a snort of fury and a stamp of my feet, crushing toes in my haste to get to him. I couldn’t see him now that the bodies were closing in again, and what if he disappeared the moment they parted, his time here in our world dwindled and not a moment of it spent with me?
“Darius!” I cried in desperation, blasting people away from me with water and giving up on showing any kind of courtesy to them.
The way was cleared, and people cursed me, scrambling to get up again, but I ran through the centre of them straight to the group of Heirs.
