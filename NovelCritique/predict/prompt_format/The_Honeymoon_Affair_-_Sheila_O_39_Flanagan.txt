### Plot Summary:
The narrative centers on the intertwined lives of Ariel Barrett, Charles Miller, and Iseult O’Connor, exploring themes of identity, love, and personal growth. Ariel, once managing Charles's literary career, is now seeking new professional and personal directions, partly by preparing to sell her agency and fostering new talents. Her growing companionship with Josh signifies a move towards emotional independence.
Meanwhile, Iseult, a customs officer previously engaged to Charles, grapples with her self-worth and role in Charles's life, especially given Ariel's lingering influence. Charles, a novelist shifting genres, is caught between these two women—the past with Ariel and a potential future with Iseult. Despite Ariel's transition toward autonomy, the dynamic remains complex.
Tensions between Charles and Iseult peak when Ariel's continued presence creates doubt. Iseult's trip to Waterford becomes a reflection point, prompting realizations about her desires versus her reality with Charles. A promotion offers career satisfaction but complicates her engagement. After Ariel discusses selling her agency and moving stateside, Iseult finds clarity and leaves Charles, marking a significant step in self-discovery.
Iseult revisits their past by attending a book event, culminating in a heartfelt encounter with Charles. Through this, Charles acknowledges his missteps and extends an olive branch along with an engagement ring, while Iseult evaluates her current stance. The segment captures her inner turmoil: does she venture into the unknown of rekindling romance, or does she continue valuing her newfound self-identity?
Both women experience growth: Ariel, embracing a path untethered to Charles, focusing on career and potential romance with Josh; Iseult, gaining confidence through self-assured decisions rather than romantic dependencies. Charles acknowledges Ariel’s professional separation, yearning for peace with Iseult. Together, their arcs articulate change and acceptance, exploring the delicate balance between love and independence. Themes of transformation manifest amid the familiar yet ever-shifting fabric of their intertwined lives and choices, with Iseult and Charles contemplating a rekindled future, signaling fresh potential yet uncharted paths.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Tears are words that need to be written.
Paulo Coelho
At the exact moment our plane touches down at the island airport in the Caribbean, my ex-fiancé is posting photos of a drinks reception from an art gallery in Florence. I know this because I turn on my phone and check his social media while I’m standing with Celeste at the carousel waiting for our luggage to arrive.
I hadn’t planned on looking at my phone. In fact, unlike nearly all the other passengers (my cousin included) who were, by now, staring intently at their mobiles, I ignore mine for at least two minutes before fishing it out of my bag and switching it on. It pings with a flurry of notifications, and every one is a post from Steve. I take a deep breath and open Instagram.
Steve is a keen amateur photographer and likes to fill his feed with moody black-and-white pictures – usually of himself looking equally moody and intense. But that’s OK, because he’s the kind of guy who looks good in a moody photograph. In fairness, he looks good in real life too. And it was his ripped body, smouldering dark eyes, and black hair shaved at the sides (but falling over his forehead in a fringe of glossy curls I’d give an arm for myself) that first made my heart do somersaults. It still somersaults every time I see him, although that hasn’t been for some time. In any event, that same heart is now broken into a million pieces.
He hasn’t posted any photos of himself in the Italian art gallery, and I assume that’s because he’s working and not a guest; but if he’s wandering around taking photos of people wearing tuxedos and cocktail dresses, I bet he’s not in his preferred gear of frayed black jeans and black leather biker jacket. Maybe he bought some appropriate designer clothes in Florence. I picture him in a suit walking through the stunning baroque room where the reception is taking place, with its ceiling fresco, tall tables decorated with rose-filled gold vases, and line of gilt framed paintings on the walls. It’s the kind of setting where you’d expect to see James Bond sipping a martini as he waits for an opportunity to drop a witty remark to the latest megalomanic hell-bent on destroying the world. I can easily imagine Steve rocking Dolce & Gabbana there, even if he’s only ever bought one T-shirt by them, and that was in TK Maxx.
He’s used the hashtags #LaDolceVita #PeroniAndProsecco #LoveItaly with his photos.
My broken heart is beating faster just thinking about him, and I have to remind myself that I’m looking at the timeline of my ex. Yet no matter how many times I tell myself this, and despite living my life without him ever since that awful day, I’m still having a hard time believing it.
