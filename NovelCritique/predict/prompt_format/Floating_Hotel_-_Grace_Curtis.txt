The Grand Abeona Hotel, a luxurious spaceship, hosts an intricate web of characters who navigate hidden motives and personal quests.

Her music helps Jean escape imperial agents, closing a chapter of her complicated history.
In a parallel narrative, Sasha, a master thief known as the Ghost of Conomi, operates under the alias Lucia Vera, executing heists aided by Nina, the hotel manager. Sasha’s relationship with Lieutenant Boric evolves from adversaries to comrades disillusioned with the Empire’s ethics.
Ephraim, the Abeona’s Head Roomkeeper, battles trauma and suspicions of murder within the hotel, while grappling with guest Claire Appleseed's possible involvement in anti-Empire activities. Flora Belle, a commanding Commissioner, strives to maintain order and curtail Claire’s influence amidst these conspiracies.
Carl, the hotel manager, wrestles with doubts as the hotel’s legacy tied to Nina Windrose presses upon him. Under pressure to appoint a successor from Flora Belle, Carl addresses internal conflict and external threats, culminating in a dire decision to sacrifice the Abeona due to tangled emotional ties and Kipple's treachery, leading to a significant departure from the jurisdiction of the Empire towards Andromeda.
Meanwhile, Rogan, a lifeguard with an outlaw past, and her friend Daphne, explore hidden layers of the ship, uncovering Nina's secret operations. Ooly Mall and Professor Azad decode an alien signal, though initially dismissed, it becomes crucial to Carl's hope of revitalizing the Abeona with alien life.
In the wake of the Abeona's evacuation, Carl navigates emotional farewells and assures the safety of everyone. Letters from Kipple reveal regret and love for Carl, expressing disdain for a life ruled by spite.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
was twelve years old the first time he laid eyes on the Grand Abeona Hotel. It was ghostly as a daytime moon, hovering low between columns of twisting, griddled rock, above a crevasse darkly spiderwebbed with cables and crawlers and great nodding anvils. He took it at first for an apparition, because it looked so much like those patches of shimmering air that appeared sometimes in his vision after he’d been punched. And he had been punched—twice, in fact, against the side of the face, because the first one hadn’t knocked him down. Once the dealer of the punch had slunk away in search of other victims, Carl crawled out to the back steps and pressed his temple against the cool metal railing, watching the stars spin around. Whenever he moved his pupils, the aberrations would move as well, so that he could never look at them dead on. But the Abeona stayed; she did not shift away from his gaze. That was how Carl knew that what he saw was real.
Once he realized that, he remembered that there’d been stories going around about some ritzy hotel ship coming into orbit, a divine visitation from the inner systems, there to prey upon the scant handful of genuine tycoons who lived in (and owned) the planet’s single city. He had heard these rumors and thought that they were probably true. But part of him still had not believed. Not until he saw the Abeona floating there.
Hoxxes was an imperial mining colony, an unhappy place that looked from orbit like a pumice stone, populated by displaced people whose brief lives were made bearable with substances that shortened them. Many dwelled there but nobody was really at home. In a few decades the whole planet would be unlivable, harvested by its occupants into a poisonous oblivion. Things had been easier in Carl’s grandparents’ time. But as the Emperor grew older his paranoia swelled, and the pace of production swelled with it, and the churn of war swallowed cheap material faster than the soil could provide.
Things, never good, were getting steadily worse.
As grim as life was on Hoxxes, Carl’s decision to leave was mostly about his family—though the less said of them, the better.
Afterward, when people asked why he’d run away to join the hotel, Carl would shrug and say, with the muted smile that became his trademark: “It was love at first sight.”
