As a coder thrilled by the internet’s early egalitarian promise, Jackie must contend with its more sinister shift toward monetization and surveillance. And as a community activist, Ellen confronts the increasing gentrification and policing overwhelming her New York City neighborhood.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Before the raids, before the hidden compartments and career retrospectives, there was a lonely girl in her room. A lonely girl in a vast cocoon of a bedroom with her own computer, privacy unquestioned. A lonely girl in a busy suburb, brother’s weights dropping across the hall, mother scolding her for spending too much time in her notebooks. A lonely girl in an apartment shared with sisters, and then alone. Secret journal entries, pilfered booze, furtive masturbation.
They were born in the same year, their families part of a network of Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese and Malaysian Chinese and Chinese Filipinos around New York, differences flattened by proximity of exile. Some families stayed in the city, while others, like Giselle Chin’s, flighted to the suburbs, existing in an alternate reality of holidays and weekends, Thanksgiving turkeys with sticky rice, Chinese New Year parties with parents blotto and maudlin as they sang along to Teresa Teng, after which Giselle would fall asleep in the back seat of her family’s Chevy wood wagon on the ride back to Jersey. On Saturday mornings Giselle and her brother Alexander went to Chinese school in a Hackensack church basement with the other jook-sing kids and one white dad who had a Chinese wife and kid, where they learned how to count in Mandarin and replicate Xeroxes of brush paintings with ink.
The Weis’ Fourth of July barbecue was supposed to be a summer reunion for the Chinese school students and their families. Larry Wei, a year younger than Giselle, made his presence known as she circled a table of potato chips and onion dip. “Guess what,” he said, mouth full. “I made a sandwich out of chips with chips inside.”
She considered ignoring him. The TV was on, and Giselle was surprised to see Jackie Ong slouched on the sofa, hair cut in a short, sleek angle following her jawline. Jackie lived in a town with no public schools because all the kids were rich and went to private. Jeans looked stylish on her without trying, while Giselle’s were bunched around her crotch. She had a wedgie, her butt was sweating, and around Jackie Ong, she felt like she stomped when she walked.
This was 1983. Chinese school wasn’t like regular school, where boys made kung-fu shouts as they pelted Giselle’s face in gym-class dodgeball. Jackie had arrived at Chinese school the previous year, at the end of fifth grade. One Saturday, when they were supposed to be painting pictures of flowers during Culture Hour, Giselle pressed her brush against the paper to drip shapes with the ink, large blots of black against smaller, lighter ones, and across the table, Jackie said, “Very Jackson Pollock.” Giselle didn’t know who that was but figured she should pretend. She said, “Oh, yeah?” The teacher came over and shushed them, but Jackie flashed her own painting at Giselle. She’d colored the entire piece of paper in solid black.
