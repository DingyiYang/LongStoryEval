### Plot Summary:
The story revolves around the Van Laar family and a tapestry of secrets involving two siblings, Bear and Barbara Van Laar, whose disappearance and death have been shrouded in deceit. Judyta "Judy" Luptack emerges as a relentless investigator keen on shedding light on these mysteries while unraveling deep-seated corruption within the local community. In 1961, the drowning of Bear Van Laar was covered up by his influential family to avoid scandal. Victor Hewitt, connected to the family through his role as a camp director, was coerced into preserving this dark secret, primarily motivated by securing his daughter T.J.'s future in the camp environment.
Years later, T.J. Hewitt courageously exposes the hidden truths, challenging the legacy of the Van Laars and the wrongful blame placed on others, such as the deceased Carl Stoddard. The investigation by Judy reveals a legacy of corruption implicating once-revered community figures as it delves into themes of power, justice, and truth.
Amidst the unfolding investigation, personal narratives highlight complex relationships between characters, emphasizing loyalty, growth, and the pursuit of truth amid societal pressures. T.J.'s decision to reveal past wrongdoings marks a generational shift toward justice within a community governed by historical power structures. The character Louise, involved tangentially, depicts the personal struggles entwined with the central narrative, illustrating emotional depth and the impact of the overarching mystery on individual lives.
Tracy’s return home from Camp Emerson evokes nostalgia and a sense of loss, symbolizing her family's changing dynamics as her father’s new life diverges from her own. Her bond with Barbara is profound, leaving her with transformative memories of friendship and resilience. Meanwhile, Judy reenters the Van Laar saga, exposing the intricate deceptions maintained by the family. Her investigation uncovers key developments: the Van Laar family members face legal consequences, while Judy, guided by intuition, uncovers Barbara’s escape plan orchestrated by T.J.
Barbara's escape is a strategic avoidance of being sent to a reform school, facilitated by T.J. She relocates to a secluded cabin in the woods, benefitting from T.J.'s survival training to live autonomously until adulthood removes her parents' control. Judy, piecing together the scenarios leading to Barbara's disappearance, opts to leave Barbara in her new refuge, respecting her choice for independence.
Overall, the narrative intertwines themes of justice, loyalty, and self-reliance, depicting Judy's relentless pursuit of truth amid an intricate web of family secrets and societal expectations. As she respects Barbara's autonomy, Judy reveals the personal transformations and sacrifices of those entangled in the Van Laar family saga.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The bed is empty.
Louise, the counselor—twenty-three, short-limbed, rasp-voiced, jolly—stands barefoot on the warm rough planks of the cabin called Balsam and processes the absence of a body in the lower bunk by the door. Later on, the ten seconds that pass between sight and inference will serve to her as evidence that time is a human construct, that it can slow or accelerate in the presence of emotion, of chemicals in the blood.
The bed is empty.
The cabin’s single flashlight—the absence of which is used, even in daylight, to indicate that campers have gone to the latrines—is in its home on a shelf by the door.
Louise turns slowly in a circle, naming the girls she can see.
Melissa. Melissa. Jennifer. Michelle. Amy. Caroline. Tracy. Kim.
Eight campers. Nine beds. She counts and counts again.
At last, when she can no longer defer it, she lets one name bob to the surface of her mind: Barbara.
The empty bed is Barbara’s.
She closes her eyes. She imagines herself returning, for the rest of her life, to this place and this moment: a lonely time traveler, a ghost, haunting the cabin called Balsam, willing a body to appear where there is none. Willing the girl herself, Barbara, to walk through the door. To say she has been in the washroom, to say she forgot the rule about taking the flashlight, to apologize disarmingly, as she has done before.
But Louise knows that Barbara won’t do any of these things. She senses, for reasons she can’t quite articulate, that Barbara is gone.
Of all the campers, Louise thinks. Of all the campers to go missing.
At 6:25 a.m., Louise walks back through a curtain into the space she shares with Annabel, the counselor-in-training. She’s seventeen, a ballet dancer from Chevy Chase, Maryland. Annabel Southworth is closer in age to the campers than she is to Louise, but she stands upright and infuses her words with irony and in general works to ensure that everyone recognizes the firm line between thirteen and seventeen—a line made manifest by the plywood partition that separates the main part of the cabin from the counselors’ corner.
Now, Louise shakes her awake. Now, Annabel squints. Crooks an elbow over her eyes dramatically. Sinks back into sleep.
Louise is becoming aware of something: the smell of metabolized beer. She had assumed it was coming from her own body—from her own skin and mouth. She certainly drank enough last night to feel the effects this morning. But standing over Annabel, she wonders whether the smell, in fact, has been coming from Annabel’s side of the room.
Which concerns her.
“Annabel,” Louise whispers. In her tone, she suddenly recognizes the sound of her own mother. And in some ways she feels like her mother—her bad mother, her irresponsible mother—in relation to this girl.
Annabel opens her eyes. She sits up and winces immediately. She meets Louise’s gaze and her eyes widen, her face becomes pale.
