### Title: Sweet Nightmare

### Genres: Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult

### Premise:
Most schools are about being the best. This school? It’s about being the worst. Calder Academy is where the rogue paranormals go. The ones who break the rules or lose control. And when that happens for vamps, werewolves, witches, and dark fae? It gets pretty freaking scary.
I should know. Because I’m trapped here.
Look, every seventeen-year-old girl thinks their mom is a tyrant. But mine just happens to run Calder Academy, which paints a giant target on my back. The way I make it through these dark halls is by steering clear of the things―and kids―who go bump in the night.
Especially Jude Abernathy-Lee.
But when a freak storm hits our isolated island, I'm stuck without a backup plan. The power is gone. The lights are out. And our worst nightmares are suddenly real―and out for blood.
Now the only way to survive is to align myself with one evil to avoid the other.
And the only thing worse than the idea of getting close to Jude? Secretly loving every minute of it.

### Plot Summary:
The storm-ravaged Calder Academy becomes the epicenter of a fierce battle against supernatural forces. At its heart, Clementine, delving into her burgeoning manticore heritage, leads her allies in fending off nightmare-spawned creatures that menace the island. The bond with Jude Abernathy-Lee is pivotal, as they explore their intertwined powers linked to Calder's mystical tapestry, an artifact intricately bound with time and dreams. Jude confronts the materialization of his nightmares as tangible threats, further shattering Calder’s timeline stability.
The unveiling of Calder’s historical tapestry is a turning point, revealing Clementine's obscured ancestry and paternal revelations through the threads of fate. This disclosure brings treachery within their ranks, instigated by the "Jean-Jerks," whose actions exacerbate the island’s chaotic unraveling. Allies like Isabel and Simon rise to prominence, stepping into critical roles as they negotiate the island’s heightened spiritual urgency. Clementine embraces her hidden legacy, merging forces with Jude, the newly minted Prince of Nightmares, and steadfast allies Luis and Izzy to counteract these ominous forces.
Significant confrontations ensue in monster-laden battlefields, testing alliances as storylines entwine through time’s fractures. Encounters with monstrous apparitions highlight Clementine's leadership growth, as she stands firm with allies to defend Calder. Jude’s transition into a protector illustrates his mastery over once-tormenting nightmares, reclaiming dominance over spectral foes. Clementine’s guardian heritage unfurls, catalyzing synthesized resolutions to the historical tapestry’s disruptions. Although the victory is marred by Ember's tragic death, it halts further disturbances, deepening commitment among the cadre. Under Jude’s leadership, their ordeals strengthen their resolve, anchoring newfound stability to Calder’s tapestry across alternate realities that Clementine and Jude judiciously manage.
Henri, the Oracle of Monroe, emerges from the tapestry, interweaving familial echoes within Calder’s history and extending Clementine’s lineage and capabilities. With his oracular insights challenging temporal paths, a reevaluation of survival narratives reshapes the characters’ defence against nightmarish adversity, shedding light on deeper betrayals sown by Clementine’s mother. This critical juncture sees Clementine consolidating her leadership as they weave desperate narratives into the tapestry’s resilient legacy—a vigilant beacon against future maelstroms.
In the aftermath, the wall imprisoning them within the academy crumbles, symbolizing newfound freedom but leaving the island and its inhabitants with myriad unresolved issues. As Jude and Clementine savor the hard-won serenity brought by their perseverance and shared love, they're soon thrust into fresh turmoil with the arrival of Caspian and Madame Z. The surprise revelation of Henri as Clementine’s father further complicates the familial landscape, while Simon inadvertently becomes embroiled in their family saga through a coin gifted by Henri. Madame Z's machinations and the presence of fae guards signal nefarious agendas and unfinished business, prompting Clementine and Jude to brace for the emerging tide of challenges, reaffirming their strength as anchors against chaos.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Of all the punishments this school for misfits and fuckups could throw at a person, I can’t believe I’m stuck with this one. Just last week, one of the new vamps nearly drained a witch and all she got was dish duty.
Ironic? Absolutely.
Fair? Not even close.
Then again, here at Calder Academy, fair is pretty much a nebulous concept, right up there with safety and good judgment. Hence the reason my mother—aka the headmaster not-so-extraordinaire of this not-so-extraordinary establishment—thinks assigning me to chrickler duty is actually a reasonable thing for an administrator to do.
Spoiler alert: it’s not. It is, however, absolutely miserable. Not to mention dangerous as hell.
Still, nearly three years of this nightmare have taught me a few tricks—chief among them, to walk softly—and slowly—and carry a really big bag of kibble.
A quick scan of the large, shadowy enclosure shows me the food has once again done its job. The little monsters are actually distracted—at least for now.
With that thought in mind, I take a small, calculated step back toward the door. When none of the chricklers raises so much as a furry eyebrow, let alone actually looks up from their long troughs full of kibble, I take another. And another. The old, wooden door that separates me from the basement hallway is almost in reach. A couple more steps and I might actually make it out of here without losing any blood.
Hope, like assholery, springs eternal.
A drop of sweat slides down my spine as I take another cautious step backward. Then I hold my breath as I reach behind me for the old-fashioned latch that keeps the chricklers—and me—locked in this cool, dark pen.
But the moment my fingers touch the lock, a huge clap of thunder rumbles across the sky.
Shit, shit, shit.
Hundreds of heads lift at the same exact time—and every single one of them turns straight toward me. Eyes narrow. Teeth flash. Growls echo off the rough stone walls.
And just like that, I’m totally fucked.
Nails skitter across the floor as they race toward me as one.
Fuck slow and steady. I whirl around and dive for the door just as the first wave reaches me.
Nails rake down my calves as I fumble for the door. I shake off the first few then gasp as teeth tear into my thigh and hip. Reaching down with one hand, I rip several more of the little bastards off of me.
