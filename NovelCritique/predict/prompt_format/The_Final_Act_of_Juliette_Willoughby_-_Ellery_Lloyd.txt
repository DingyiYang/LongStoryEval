### Plot Summary:
The intertwined narratives of past and present unfold around the cryptic art and murder mysteries tied to Juliette Willoughby, who later assumed the identity of Alice Long. In 1938, Juliette, a Surrealist artist in Paris, becomes engulfed in familial manipulations and the aftermath of her sister Lucy's tragic demise. The contemporary storyline in Dubai entails Dr. Caroline Cooper's scholarly quest to uncover the concealed truths in Juliette's legacy, while also getting embroiled in solving Harry Willoughby's murder.
In Dubai, Caroline aids her ex-husband Patrick Lambert, falsely accused of Harry's murder. Through Dave White's tech-savvy interventions, the narrative unveils Freddie Talbot's hidden life in Dubai, unraveling a web of deceit linked to Harry's fraudulent art dealings. As secrets come to light—connecting family, inheritance, betrayal, and Juliette's artwork—Caroline's investigation gains momentum.
Alice Long's (Juliette's) traumatic recounts from 1991 reveal her shadowed childhood and her father's Egyptology obsessions, hinting at a grand design in her paintings. The story returns to Dubai where Caroline, informed by Athena about Freddie's submerged guilt, confronts unveiled truths within familial and historical contexts. When Patrick is released from false allegations, he joins Caroline to decode historical enigmas at Longhurst Hall. This leads to Alice’s secret mission to revive her artistic heritage.
At Longhurst, they divulge hidden messages from Juliette’s paintings, entwined with sinister historical truths. Cyril Willoughby's dark past, including possible lead poisoning-induced madness, unravels further as police investigations discover a mass burial site beneath Longhurst, linked to Cyril’s nefarious deeds.
Alice Long’s lifelong orchestration to protect her work becomes apparent. Caroline, using modern technology, confirms Alice’s dual identity as a surviving Juliette. This revelation reshapes understandings of her legacy, bridging the narratives of past tragedies with present-day truths, acknowledging both her hidden survival and creative resilience.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
CAROLINE, DUBAI, THE PRESENT DAY
It is time to begin.
I am standing at a podium in front of a painting in an art gallery in Dubai. It is not a large painting—30 inches by 21 inches, to be precise. It is not a very large gallery—we are in the biggest of its three rooms, a white-painted space about the size of a school classroom. Arranged in front of me are several rows of folding chairs, occupied by reporters. I have already been introduced to a writer from the Telegraph and the Gulf News podcast team. A group of press photographers are clicking away, flashguns strobing. At the back are two TV crews, one from a local Arabic station, one from BBC News.
Beside me at the podium is the owner of the gallery, the organizer of this press conference, Patrick Lambert.
“Dr. Caroline Cooper,” Patrick is saying, “is a Fellow of Pembroke College and professor of modern art at the University of Cambridge, specializing in the Surrealist movement in the 1930s, with a focus on Surrealist art by women, in particular the British painter Juliette Willoughby.”
Patrick lists my publications, highlighting my 1998 biography of Juliette, the first ever written and still—he reminds everyone—the definitive account of the artist’s life, work, and untimely death. He also mentions how long he and I have known each other. One or two audience members smile knowingly.
The painting on the wall behind us is entitled Self-Portrait as Sphinx. It was painted by Juliette—then twenty-one years old—in the winter of 1937–38, and was first displayed at the era-defining International Surrealist Exhibition in Paris in 1938. For decades it was lost, believed destroyed. Last night it was sold, right here, for £42 million.
“Thank you, Patrick,” I say as he takes a seat in the front row. He gives me a wink. I stifle a smile back.
I have been asked to keep my speech short: just five minutes in which to explain Surrealism, its historical context and underlying philosophy. To convey why this artwork matters, why I believe it to be genuine, and why I am prepared to stake my professional reputation on that opinion. To tell the story of the artist and this painting, and how it was lost, and how it was found again—twice.
It is a story that begins one wet autumn morning in Cambridge in 1991, at our first dissertation supervision with Alice Long, with the conversation that set Patrick and me on a path that would eventually lead us to Juliette’s lost masterpiece.
It is a story that begins one winter evening in Paris in 1937, when a runaway British heiress embarked, in the cold and cramped Montmartre studio she shared with her famous artist lover, on one of the most remarkable paintings of its era.
