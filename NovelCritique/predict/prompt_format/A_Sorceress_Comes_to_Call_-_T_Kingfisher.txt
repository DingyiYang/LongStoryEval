### Title: A Sorceress Comes to Call

### Genres: Fantasy, Horror, Retellings

### Premise:
Cordelia knows her mother is unusual. Their house doesn’t have any doors between rooms, and her mother doesn't allow Cordelia to have a single friend—unless you count Falada, her mother's beautiful white horse. The only time Cordelia feels truly free is on her daily rides with him. But more than simple eccentricity sets her mother apart. Other mothers don’t force their daughters to be silent and motionless for hours, sometimes days, on end. Other mothers aren’t sorcerers.
After a suspicious death in their small town, Cordelia’s mother insists they leave in the middle of the night, riding away on Falada’s sturdy back, leaving behind all Cordelia has ever known. They arrive at the remote country manor of a wealthy older man, the Squire, and his unwed sister, Hester. Cordelia’s mother intends to lure the Squire into marriage, and Cordelia knows this can only be bad news for the bumbling gentleman and his kind, intelligent sister.
Hester sees the way Cordelia shrinks away from her mother, how the young girl sits eerily still at dinner every night. Hester knows that to save her brother from bewitchment and to rescue the terrified Cordelia, she will have to face down a wicked witch of the worst kind.

### Plot Summary:
Cordelia embarks on a perilous journey against her controlling mother, Evangeline, a powerful sorceress using familial ties and magic to expand her influence. Aided by Penelope Green's ghost, Cordelia exposes Evangeline's plans, including exploiting Lord Evermore for financial gain. Determined to thwart her mother’s schemes, Cordelia orchestrates a phony engagement with Evermore and seeks refuge with friends Hester and Richard at Evermore’s estate.
As the group delves into unraveling Evangeline's dark magic, they find a potential ritual solution in Evermore’s library, involving mundane elements to counteract her spells. However, the threat of Falada, Evangeline’s loyal yet increasingly monstrous horse-like familiar, looms ominously. Cordelia fears her mother might use Falada or raise the dead, complicating their resistance further.
During a crucial ritual, the group’s initial attempt to neutralize Falada’s threat fails, worsening their predicament. Cordelia goes alone to confront Falada, believing her unique position as Evangeline’s daughter safeguards her from harm. With Alice’s aid, Cordelia sneaks out to lure Falada away, encountering Evangeline in the woods before an inevitable confrontation ensues.
In a climactic sequence, Cordelia meets Evangeline, who forces her to betray her allies. Battling magical bonds, aided by Penelope's ghost, Cordelia diverts an attack intended for Evermore. Empowered by her friends' determination and Penelope’s spirit, a chaotic series of events unfolds. Hester and Imogene confront Evangeline with Imogene halting Falada’s charge. Willard suggests a renewed ritual effort, with Penelope’s ghostly assistance.
Embracing her mother during the ritual, Cordelia severs Evangeline's dark power. Evangeline’s influence dissolves, leading to a poignant conclusion where sacrifice bridges the divide between life and death, ensuring Cordelia's determination prevails.
In the aftermath, as members of the group recuperate, a thoughtful resolve emerges to better understand the encountered supernatural forces by documenting their knowledge. Meanwhile, Hester and Richard contemplate adopting Cordelia, suggesting a new family dynamic. Cordelia, visiting Penelope's grave, reflects on her future and potential connections, indicating a new beginning shaped by past experiences and newfound autonomy.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
There was a fly walking on Cordelia’s hand and she was not allowed to flick it away.
She had grown used to the ache of sitting on a hard wooden pew and being unable to shift her weight. It still hurt, but eventually her legs went to sleep and the ache became a dull, all-over redness that was easier to ignore.
Though her senses were dulled in obedience, her sense of touch stayed the strongest. Even when she was so far under that the world had a gray film around the edges, she could still feel her clothing and the touch of her mother’s hand. And now the fly’s feet itched, which was bad, then tickled, which was worse.
At the front of the church, the preacher was droning on. Cordelia had long since lost the thread. Lust and tithing were his two favorite topics. Probably it was one of those. Her mother took her to church every Sunday and Cordelia was fairly certain that he had been preaching the same half-dozen sermons for the past year.
Her eyes were the only muscles that she could control, so she was not looking at him, but down as far as she could. At the very bottom of her vision, she could see her hands folded in her lap and the fly picking its way delicately across her knuckles.
Her mother glanced at her and must have noticed that she was looking down. Cordelia’s chin rose so that she could no longer see her hands. She was forced to study the back of the head of the man in front of her. His hair was thinning toward the back and was compressed down at the sides, as if he wore a hat most days. She did not recognize him, but that was no surprise. Since her days at school had ended, Cordelia only saw the other townsfolk when she went to church.
Cordelia lost the tickling sensation for a moment and dared to hope that the fly was gone, but then the delicate web between her thumb and forefinger began to itch.
Her eyes began to water at the sensation and she blinked them furiously. Crying was not acceptable. That had been one of the first lessons of being made obedient. It would definitely not be acceptable in church, where other people would notice. Cordelia was fourteen and too old to cry for seemingly no reason—because of course she could not tell anyone the reason.
The fly crossed over to her other hand, each foot landing like an infinitesimal pinprick. The stinging, watering sensation in her eyes started to feel like a sneeze coming on.
Sneezing would be terrible. She could not lift her hands or turn her head, so it would hit the back of the man’s head, and he would turn around in astonishment and her mother would move her mouth to apologize and everyone would be staring at her for having been so ill-mannered.
