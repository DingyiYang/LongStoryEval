### Plot Summary:
Clove, also known by her prior identity Calla Lily, is a mother grappling with the traumatic shadow cast by her abusive father and the consequential imprisonment of her mother, who took the blame for his death to protect Clove. Relocated in Oregon, Clove strives to shield her children, Nova and Lark, from the chaos of her own upbringing. Clove’s precarious stability is disrupted when figures and truths from her past surface, especially through her complex friendship with Celine, originally introduced as Jane, a critical figure from Clove’s history in Hawaii.
As Clove is compelled to confront her past, Celine kidnaps Clove's children to reunite them with Clove’s mother, whom Celine had been secretly visiting. The intervention of The Butcher, a former lover, forces Clove to delve deep into memories of her role in her father’s death, ultimately unraveling the weave of her childhood trauma. Clove’s husband, initially unaware of her past, is caught in a storm of deception and revelation that tests their marriage's foundations.
Together, Clove and her husband manage to locate their children, culminating in a charged confrontation with Celine. Here, Celine discloses her survival from oppressive circumstances under her deceitful mother and her subsequent transformation. She demands that Clove face her history and liberate her mother by publicizing her story. Recognizing the necessity of this, Clove crafts her narrative, bracing to face the repercussions of unveiling hidden pasts.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
The world is not made for mothers. Yet mothers made the world. The world is not made for children. Yet children are the future. Or so I’ve seen on posters at pediatric offices. Pro-life campaigns. PBS maybe. When I was in school, we spent our lunch hour foreheads pressed to the table while a small twitchy principal bellowed into a megaphone for silence. This was before the internet and secret viral videos and conscious parenting. He and the lunch ladies swatted at us but never hit. I don’t remember telling you about it. I’m sure it seemed irrelevant to me at that time in my life, meaning my entire childhood, when all we cared about was surviving my father. My head on the cool table, solemnly eating Tater Tots, probably seemed like heaven.
Do you get Tater Tots where you are?
Now I’m the mother of Nova and Lark, seven-year-old girl, three-year-old boy, and I sense I’m coming to something important. Or rather, something important is coming to me. It will serve us both to bear witness. The world is not made for us — certainly it’s not; just try to afford preschool — but this thing I’m starting to understand, transforming from felt to known, it’s about the energy of violence. The way violence shrinks women, makes us feel lucky for things that aren’t lucky. Even when we think we’ve outrun it, look back — see its long reaching fingers touching every choice we’ve made.
For many years, despite all I’d seen and all I’d survived, I thought I had evaded those long fingers. That life was about wise choices. For instance, if I did motherhood differently than you, if I ensured a peaceful family life, then I could leave the past behind. No. Not just behind. I could annihilate it.
I would not, for example, burden myself with recalling the time you put a flat of plastic bottled waters in our shopping cart. They were marked down, what we’d been waiting for. You had decided women with plastic water bottles poking out of their purses were living at the height of luxury. You even had me excited to carry one around in the mini backpack we’d stolen from Mervyn’s. “Don’t make eye contact,” you’d said as we left without paying for it. We never felt bad about stealing. Life owed us minor rewards. But stealing from a grocery store was a non-option. “Not the grocery store,” you’d said, exasperated once when I’d gone to pocket a candy bar. I asked why not. “You don’t bite the hand that feeds you,” you answered. I didn’t understand. The same way I didn’t understand why bottled water, Crystal Geyser to be exact, had become such a preoccupation. Now I know it was easier to fixate on small externals than address the fact that we did not know if we would live to see the next day.
