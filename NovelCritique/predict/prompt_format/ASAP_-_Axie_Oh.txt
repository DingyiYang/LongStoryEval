Sori has worked her whole life to become a K-pop idol, until she realizes she doesn’t want a life forever in the spotlight. But that’s not actually up to Sori—she’s caught between her exacting mother’s entertainment company and her father’s presidential aspirations. And as the pressure to keep her flawless public image grows, the last person she should be thinking about is her ex-boyfriend.
Nathaniel is off limits—she knows this. A member of one of the biggest K-pop bands in the world and forbidden from dating, he isn’t any more of an option now than he was two years ago. Still, she can’t forget that their whirlwind romance was the last time she remembers being really happy. Or that his family welcomed her into their home when she needed it most...
So when Nathaniel finds himself rocked by scandal, Sori offers him a hideaway with her. And back in close quarters, it’s hard to deny their old feelings.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
My phone buzzes as the cab lets me off at the corner of West 32nd Street and Broadway, where light snow drifts over bright signs in both Hangeul and English. I read the text from Secretary Park: A limousine service will pick you up from your hotel at 11:00 and take you to the airport tomorrow. I’ll be waiting when you arrive in Seoul. See you soon.
Okay, thank you, I send back, and sigh at the irony that I communicate more with my mother’s secretary than I do her.
Pocketing my phone and pressing my shopping bag to my chest, I look both ways before crossing the street. There’s a party arriving at the restaurant door before me, and I wait for them to pass—three guys wearing peacoats and puffy jackets over their NYU hoodies. The last, a dark-skinned boy with glasses, catches sight of me and holds the door open. I hurry forward, smiling at him and bowing out of habit. The boy’s ears redden, and when he moves to join his friends, they poke him with their elbows, throwing glances at me over their shoulders.
As I slip off my coat, a few people seated by a bar area turn to stare. Along with my booted heels and custom handbag, I’m wearing a bodysuit with high-waisted jeans. I would have changed after the show—the last of the events I was invited to for New York Fashion Week—but that would have taken time, and I didn’t want to waste any more. Not tonight.
I scan the restaurant, searching for a familiar face. The place is packed with foreigners, Americans, speaking English so fast it makes my head spin. The hostess, who’d been seating the group of university students, returns to the podium. “Eoseo oseyo,” she says. She must have picked up on my nerves, because she’s switched from English to Korean. I’m immediately put at ease. “How many?”
“I’m meeting someone,” I tell her. “She’s around my age and height, probably wearing a baseball cap.” She’s hardly ever without it.
“Ah.” The hostess nods. “Your friend arrived a few minutes ago. Follow me. I’ll bring you to the table.”
She leads me through a side door and up a stairwell strung with Christmas lights, though it’s February. We move aside to let a group of girls and boys walk down the stairs. They’re dressed as if going to a concert, in stylish clothes and heavy makeup, which is similar to how I’m dressed having come from a runway show. A few hold signs with messages printed in English.
XOXO’s #1 Fan
Sun-oppa, marry me!
Bae Jaewoo, I love you!
