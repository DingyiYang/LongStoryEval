### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
Mel Sorrento stared at the black velvet box sitting on the Carrara marble bar top and tried not to roll her eyes.
It wasn’t the guy’s fault, or the fault of the engagement ring that probably cost something like fifty grand. Mel was just tired of this bullshit. Love. Marriage. Putting unethical gemstones into champagne flutes. All of it.
“So, okay,” the guy said. There was a fine sheen of sweat along his prematurely receding hairline. He was chalk white, his eyes darting around like he expected to be caught red-handed at any moment. “I told her I was going to the bathroom. She can’t see me, can she?” His head swiveled toward the back of the lounge, where the emerald velvet booths were more shadow than candlelight.
“No, you’re fine.” That was a tad optimistic. He actually looked like he was on the verge of fainting. Mel poured the guy a glass of ice water. Proposals usually didn’t go well if the question-popper passed out in the middle of it.
“Oh, thank you.” The man reached for it, but his hands must have been as sweaty as the rest of him, because he fumbled it badly. It landed with a terrific crash, broken glass mixing with crushed ice, the water making a mess of cocktail napkins and menus alike. “Fuck! I’m sorry.”
“No worries.” Mel swept up the glass with a rag and, without missing a beat, moved the ring box before the pool of ice water reached it. She cast an apologetic smile at the patrons seated at the bar, craning their necks to see what was going on. Jessica, her fellow bartender, swept by in a blur, doing her damnedest to serve everyone while Mel was otherwise occupied. Mel mouthed a silent thanks as she delivered glasses of water to guests on Mel’s side; Jessica waved it off with a tap to her own wedding band. She knew the score: proposals took precedence.
The ring guy, meanwhile, moaned like his guts were being torn up. “Maybe this is a sign that I shouldn’t ask her tonight. Would she really want to marry a guy like me? What if she says no? God, if she says no—”
“Take a breath, friend.” Mel caught his panicked gaze and held it. She was a good bartender, which meant she could stick an engagement ring in a glass, clean up a mess, and be someone’s therapist all at the same time. Possibly, at some point, she’d even mix a drink. “What’s your name?” she asked.
“Darryl.”
Yeah, he looked like a Darryl.
“Everything’s going to be okay, Darryl,” she said. That was a stretch, but who cared. “You’re here in this beautiful place on this beautiful night and you’re going to ask the beautiful—what’s her name?”
“Pauline,” he said with an exhausted sigh.
