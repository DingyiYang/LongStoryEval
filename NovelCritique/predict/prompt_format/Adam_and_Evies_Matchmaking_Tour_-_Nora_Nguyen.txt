What’s a few weeks to a lifetime of promise?
Evie Lang’s life is in shambles. On the heels of losing her beloved aunt, she's unceremoniously fired from her poetry professorship by her secret boyfriend. Lacking income and inspiration, she's stuck in Ohio with no idea how to move forward—until hope arrives in a surprising letter.
Auntie Hảo left Evie the deed to her San Francisco row house, a place full of Evie’s happiest memories. The catch? To inherit, she must go on a pre-arranged matchmaking tour in Việt Nam. The last thing Evie wants is to spend time with a group of strangers looking for love. But she can't resist the chance to finally visit her family’s native home.
A world away, Adam Quyền has a chip on his shoulder.

Adam thinks Evie is chaotic and unpredictable. Evie thinks Adam is grumpy and uptight. But from the bustling streets of Hồ Chí Minh City to the soaring waterfalls in Đà Lạt, they keep getting thrown together, their animosity charged with attraction...and they discover that true love may be out there, if they are willing to take a leap.

### Plot Summary:
Evie Lang, a Vietnamese American poet, joins the Love Yêu Tours in Việt Nam, aiming to reconnect with her roots while honoring her late Auntie Hảo. During the tour, she falls for Adam Quyền, a tour organizer, amidst challenges with his family, primarily Mr. Quyền, Adam's father. Adam juggles duties at his sister Ruby's startup with growing affections for Evie, leading to a confession of love in Hội An. Evie’s career fears cause her to leave Adam and return to San Francisco, even as her poetry gains recognition.
Stateside, Evie works to preserve Auntie Hảo’s Victorian home, longing for Adam, and mending ties with her mother, Grace. Fueled by memories and lessons from Auntie Hảo, she reaffirms her love for Adam. Meanwhile, Adam is heartbroken by Evie's departure, but spurred by advice from his grandmother Bà Nội, he resolves to pursue Evie. Ruby, managing Love Yêu and coping with her own marital issues, advises Adam to find happiness beyond family obligations. A chance encounter with ex-girlfriend Lana in Hồ Chí Minh City leads Adam to confront his relationship barriers further. A pivotal letter from Evie prompts him to reevaluate past choices.
As Evie visits Little Saigon, nostalgic for Vietnam, she consults psychic Bà Oanh, who prompts her to courageously face her regrets. This pushes her toward fulfilling Auntie Hảo's vision of an artist's retreat. Reconnected, Adam visits Evie, expressing his unwavering love and commitment to their future. They abandon old fears, welcoming a shared life and collaboration, turning Auntie Hảo’s home into Cabinet of Curiosities, a burgeoning arts retreat.
A year later, Adam and Evie lead a tour to Phong Nha Caves in Việt Nam, now married and contemplating purchasing a home there. The retreats have excelled, born of Evie's own experiences, offering creative rest and nurturing community. With his recent financial gains from Love Yêu, they maintain a relaxed schedule to focus on personal projects. Evie's poetry and ongoing memoir earn praise, and she often collaborates with Grace.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
San Francisco
“Green is your color, Evie-pie.”
Auntie Hảo removed the dangling jade earrings from the silk pouch and helped Evie secure the gold latches behind her ears. Evie swung her head gently, shaking the smooth circles onto her cheeks. In Auntie Hảo’s enormous gilt mirror—bought at an estate sale of a minor Thai princess—Evie saw herself reflected. Gangly, too tall for her age, and eternally uncertain; uncool by anyone’s standards, especially Queen Bee Tessa, who ruled the seventh grade with steely determination. But with the jade earrings, Evie felt different. Older, maybe. Definitely more sophisticated. They looked like they belonged.
“I love them,” Evie said, touching her ears. “They make me feel more Vietnamese.”
“Your father would have been proud,” Auntie Hảo said, smoothing Evie’s wayward hair from her forehead.
“Not my mother,” Evie muttered. “She hates anything that reminds her of Việt Nam. And Dad.”
Auntie Hảo avoided her niece’s eyes. “Grace is still grieving.”
Evie didn’t say that Grace slept every moment that she wasn’t at work. Once, Evie tiptoed into her mother’s room and tried to wake her—it was dinnertime, and there was no food in the house—but Grace only flipped over and hugged the pillow tighter. “Why can’t everyone leave me alone?” she’d asked, her voice muffled. Evie wanted to scream, Because you have a daughter! And someone has to keep this family together! Was this how everyone grieved?
Evie’s father, Danh Lang, had died the previous year, and neither his wife nor his daughter had recovered. Evie’s brand of grief was channeled into mournful stanzas in her journal, while Grace’s seemed to rise like a fog in the house, covering every inch, every formerly happy memory. The rooms, once full of voices and laughter, became dreadfully quiet. Empty.
Now all Evie had of her father was Auntie Hảo. And Grace didn’t even want her to have that. She’d tried to stop Evie’s summer trip to San Francisco to visit Auntie Hảo, but Evie’s wheedling eventually worked. Maybe Grace needed a break from her melodramatic daughter too.
“I won’t forgive her for not letting me go to Việt Nam with you,” Evie said.
“It’s a big trip. Your mother was right to put a stop to it; I should have talked to her before I invited you.”
“It wouldn’t have mattered,” Evie said sullenly.
“It matters to her.”
“Tell me about Việt Nam,” Evie said, changing the subject.
