### Plot Summary:
Carmen Acosta resides at the Marbrisa estate driven by the need to uncover the truth behind her sister Carolina’s murder. She navigates a complex web of family secrets and historical tragedies tied to the estate. Carmen's investigation is complicated by family dynamics, particularly with her brother-in-law Asher Wyatt and Detective Pierce, who investigates Marbrisa’s mysteries. Marbrisa’s haunting history is marked by mysterious deaths, including Anna Barnes, who is revealed to still be alive. Anna and Robert Barnes' tumultuous relationship and the murky fate of Lenora Watson are central to the story’s past. At Marbrisa, Carmen delves into these legacies, with Nathaniel Hayes, an investigator. Despite initial tensions, they form an alliance.
Unveiling connections between the past and present tragedies of the estate reveals Mrs. Morrison, the housekeeper, as a source of insight. She discloses Robert's extramarital affairs and Anna Barnes’ plan to escape. Robert’s betrayals and Lenora's death underpin Marbrisa's tragic lineage. In a modern twist, Carmen discovers a knife linked to her sister’s murder in Asher’s car, heightening suspicions and urgency.
In a dramatic climax, during a storm-induced power outage, Carmen and Nathaniel find Mrs. Morrison injured, but alive, in Carmen's room. They face George, who reveals himself as the murderer, driven by claims to Marbrisa as his birthright. He confesses to killing Carolina and framing Asher. Carmen bravely defends herself, stabbing George, bringing his threat—and Marbrisa’s mysteries—to an end.
The epilogue provides reflective closure. Anna Barnes, once presumed dead, visits Marbrisa with Michael Harrison, the gardener who helped her escape. They face memories and tragedies tied to the estate, making peace with their decisions. Anna’s return to Marbrisa is significant; her character offers a bridge between past and present, reconciliation of history as Marbrisa is transformed into a hospital. Carmen, now connected to Marbrisa’s future, also plays a pivotal role in this transition. Michael and Anna leave Marbrisa, their goodbyes a metaphorical release from the past’s burdens. Marbrisa, a once-grand estate shrouded in secrets, now ushers hope and healing for the future.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
I cannot for the life of me imagine why anyone would want to live in Florida.
The house looms before me, a pale stone behemoth jettisoning from the swampy earth. It casts a long shadow, towering three stories high with a parapet on top as though it’s readying itself to guard against intruders. Its palatial size and exterior appear to have been plucked from some European city and dropped on this godforsaken plot of land in Miami. There are arches and flourishes all around the building, the fanciful embellishments reminiscent of a wedding cake’s intricate design. Enormous glass-paned windows dominate the facade, equally impressive doors leading out to a front patio set atop a stone staircase made of the palest coral that matches the house’s exterior walls.
The grass sways a few feet away conjuring images of snakes slithering through the tall blades. What sort of reptiles do they have in Florida? Large ones capable of felling a full-grown person? This feels like the end of civilization as we know it—a far cry from Manhattan and the sensibilities we have grown accustomed to.
The house is nearing completion, the progress an undeniable sign of just how long my husband has been keeping this secret.
Robert took me to Italy for our honeymoon years ago, and it appears he gathered a great deal of his inspiration from the grand houses we saw on our trip there.
There weren’t alligators in Italy, though.
And it wasn’t this hot.
A thin line of sweat trickles between my shoulder blades, my already dampened gown sticking to my skin as I trudge away from my husband’s roadster toward our future home. As a little girl sitting in the pews of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, I often thought about the fires of hell as I prayed for my immortal soul. I envisioned the devil’s playground to have a climate like this one, but in all my wild imaginings, Lucifer didn’t have lizards.
Men mill about the property, working on the construction Robert has planned. It looks to be rough work, heavy pieces of stone being carried from one side of the house to another, the radiant sun beating down on the men. It must be hell doing such strenuous physical labor in this stifling heat.
