### Title: Under Loch and Key

### Genres: Romance, Fantasy, Paranormal

### Premise:
Keyanna “Key” MacKay is used to secrets. Raised by a single father who never divulged his past, it’s only after his death that she finds herself thrust into the world he’d always refused to speak of. With just a childhood bedtime story about a monster that saved her father’s life and the name of her estranged grandmother to go off of, Key has no idea what she’ll find in Scotland. But repeating her father’s mistakes and being rescued by a gorgeous, angry Scotsman—who thinks she’s an idiot—is definitely the last thing she expects.
Lachlan Greer has his own secrets to keep, especially from the bonnie lass he pulls to safety from the slippery shore—a lass with captivating eyes and the last name he’s been taught not to trust. He’s looking for answers as well, and Key’s presence on the grounds they both now occupy presents a real problem. It’s even more troublesome when he gets a front row seat to the lukewarm welcome Key receives from her family; the strange powers she begins to develop; and the fierce determination she brings to every obstacle in her path. Things he shouldn’t care about, and someone he definitely doesn’t find wildly attractive.
When their secrets collide, it becomes clear that Lachlan could hold the answers Keyanna is after—and that she might also be the key to uncovering his. Up against time, mystery, and a centuries old curse, they’ll quickly discover that magic might not only be in fairy tales, and that love can be a real loch-mess.

### Plot Summary:
Keyanna MacKay, an American woman with latent fire magic, travels to Greerloch, Scotland, on a mission to scatter her deceased father's ashes, unwittingly exposing herself to an ancient curse affecting her MacKay and Greer families. This curse transforms Lachlan Greer into a kelpie-like creature, casting a shadow over their interwoven lineage. Guided by her Scottish grandparents, Finlay and Rhona, Keyanna sets out to uncover and solve the curse's mysteries, joining forces with her cousin Brodie.
As Keyanna navigates a world filled with family tensions, historic curses, and hidden legacies, she and Lachlan form an unlikely but compelling romantic bond. Their relationship, however, faces strains upon discovering from Duncan MacKay's journal that Keyanna could play a pivotal role in lifting the curse. Lachlan hesitates to reveal this, fearing for her safety and stirring tension that leads Keyanna to briefly step back.
Tensions escalate when external threats loom, and Lachlan is attacked by mysterious forces hinting at larger plots. Moreover, revelations about Keyanna's father's motivations and ultimate sacrifice redefine her understanding of familial duty. Driven by newfound resolve, she returns for a decisive confrontation, only to find tragic evidence of a fight and magically be drawn to a graveyard.
An intense face-off emerges at the graveyard, where Brodie, driven by jealousy, seeks power for himself, using Lachlan's life as leverage. Keyanna retrieves a significant artifact, Tavish MacKay’s bridle, believed to hold the key to breaking the curse. The attempt to negotiate fails, leading to chaos with the bridle catching fire. Amidst the turmoil, Keyanna uses her inherent magic and embodies forgiveness, successfully dissipating the curse, marking the culmination of her growth journey.
Consequently, Lachlan's father returns to human form, exemplifying the transformative power within Keyanna. Her actions finally reconcile family tensions, opening a hopeful chapter beyond the curse's shadows. Her deepening bond with Lachlan promises a future unmoored from longstanding familial curses, wrapped in love.
Four years later, they relish the joys of family life with their daughter, Sorcha, within a supportive, reconciled clan. Lachlan and Keyanna’s relationship matures into a bond of deep love and shared aspirations, portraying their journey from individual curses to a shared life filled with hope. The preservation of family legacies is assured, built upon understanding, history, and unconditional commitment.

### Excerpt (Demonstrating Writing and Language):
I never imagined that my death would come by way of a sheep avalanche, but as I watch the tumbling mass of floof barreling down the hill toward the stretch of road I am currently stalled on—it occurs to me that it would at least be a memorable way to go.
“Christ.”
I scramble to get the door of my ancient rental open—the door being on the wrong side, relatively, I might add, which means it’s in direct line of impact for the bleating army currently rushing toward me. I manage to snatch my backpack and duck out of the car and half stumble to a safer area, but the sheep, being less murderous than I’d come to believe, actually start to slow as they spill around the aged blue sedan, voicing their irritation of the impediment it makes by loudly trilling more of the hellishly loud bahs.
“Oi!” a voice calls from up the hill. “You all right, lass?”
I bring a hand over my eyes to peer up into the sun, noticing a man with graying hair waving down at me. “Fine,” I call back. “They’re not carnivorous, are they?”
“Not last I checked,” he chuckles, trotting down the hillside. He notices my car in the midst of the sheep-sea, quirking a brow. “Car troubles?”
“I told the woman at the rental place I wasn’t good with a stick shift, but apparently, it was all they had left.”
“You an American?” He doesn’t ask it like it’s something to be offended by, but he does sound perplexed. “You’re a right ways from the tourist spots, aren’t you?”
“Oh, I’m here for…” I trail off, deciding it’s probably a bad idea to vomit my entire complicated pilgrimage to a veritable stranger. “I’m here to visit family.”
His eyes crinkle at the corners, a bright, expressive blue among the weathered lines of his face making him seem genuinely interested. “Is that right? And who might you belong to? I know everyone around these parts.”
I hesitate, again considering the ramifications of telling a stranger about my spur-of-the-moment reunion with my estranged family before they know about it. In the end, I reason that, if nothing else, there’s a good chance I will reach my grandmother’s house before this man can wade out of his pile of sheep.
“The MacKays,” I tell him. “Rhona MacKay?”
“Oh, aye, aye, I know Rhona! Is she your granny, then? Would that make Duncan your da?” He squints as if trying to make the connection. “You’ve got the look of him. Didn’t know he had any weans when he ran off to America.”
I try to process all of this; I am deciding to take his stream of consciousness as overt friendliness and not some backhanded comment on my father’s complicated history with his family. He must notice my stunned expression, though, because he waves a hand back and forth.
